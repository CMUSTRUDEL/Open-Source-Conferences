uh welcome everyone to the finnos open

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,480
source readiness

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,840
working group uh we're glad to have you

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,439

um i'm thrilled to have a guest speaker

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,040
on a topic that we haven't done a lot

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
uh of sessions on in the past which is

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
uh the interaction of open source and

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
patents

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,239
uh which i know is is a

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,520
question that's um that's certainly on a

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,559
lot of your lawyers minds

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,840
not your own and van

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,199
has as much experience as anyone i know

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,280
on this topic so i'm really happy to

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,600
have van lindberg van

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,320
is a partner at the law firm taylor

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
english and he's also working on a new

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,039
venture

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,920
um to support open source program

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,080
offices that i will let him go into

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,560
himself so van we're really glad to have

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,040
you take it away

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
well thank you very much aaron and i am

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
glad to be here today

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
i'm going to share i'm going to share my

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
screen so that i can go through some

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
slides but

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,240
i uh i do hope that if you have

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,320
any questions if you want to uh raise

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
your hand put them in the chat uh or

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
even

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,680
or even just speak up i'm fully willing

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,280
to make this a conversation because i

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
think that this is one of

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,119
those topics that is both very

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,799
interesting and also can be

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,720
somewhat complex so

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,840
i'm going to like i said i'm going to

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
share just a second

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,000
all right so you should be seeing

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,759
you should be seeing my my screen now

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
if not it'll probably come up in just a

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,960
moment

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,920
so let me tell you uh

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,719
all just uh a little bit about me and

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
and

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,640
and where i came from i started out as a

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,239
a developer

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
and i never really gave it up even when

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
i went to law school

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
and so as soon as i came out i started

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
focusing on

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,120
on open source and open source and

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
helping

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
companies with that but i also found

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,599
that there

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
with some for someone with an

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,599
engineering degree the the most val

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,280
the most commonly requested service was

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,720
actually related to patents

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
and so my entire career has been sort of

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,400
balancing these two things

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,280
both both patents and how to

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
deal with and manage patent assertions

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
and then

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,959
also open source and so a lot of the

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,599
questions that i always get are

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,560
how are we going how can you manage

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,000
these two things at the same time

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
so a lot of this to a certain extent

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,239
this came to a head

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,239
somewhat last year i don't know how many

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,519
of you know who david capos is

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,400
he's a he's a partner at uh

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,400
at cravath

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,920
and also the former under secretary for

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,800
the united states patent and trademark

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,400
office

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,319
and he wrote an article in the uh

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
he wrote an article in the columbia

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,840
science and technology law journal

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,720
arguing that open source licenses

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,799
were inherently that at least most of

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,120
them were inherently compatible

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,720
with uh royalty bearing patent licenses

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,599
uh i thought that this was incorrect and

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,080
so

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
we i reached out and they gave me the

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
opportunity

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,280
to actually publish a a

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,040
response piece in the in the same

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,200
in the same journal next to

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,080
kapos's piece and this caught a lot of

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,959
people's eyes because

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,959
well i believe that i had the the

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
significantly the better of the argument

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
if a lot of people didn't read a lot

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,120
past the

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,920
the the headlines and all they saw was

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,200
here are people

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,840
arguing as to whether open source

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,800
and patent protection is compatible

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
and especially because in particular

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,639
where we were looking at this idea of

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,199
paying royalties uh

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,040
him saying hey these are compatible and

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,320
and i was saying no they're not

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,520
really led to a few people having some

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,199
having some confusion so that's part of

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
what i'd like to go into today is

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
understand how these things can work

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
together

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,280
and in fact most

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,320
open source oriented companies are major

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,840
patent holding companies for example the

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
largest patent holding company in the

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,840
world

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,520
ibm uh bought red hat which is also is

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
which is the largest

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,840
uh which is the largest open source

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,880
oriented company in the world

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,840
now no i didn't say open source using or

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
or open source companies because one of

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,759
the things that

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
i am sure you are coming to grips with

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,479
is the fact that

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,240
every company uh has

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
essentially every company has open

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
source in it and usually

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
they have a significant amount of open

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,919
source in it

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,919
more than people frequently realize

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,280
but the fact is that even for companies

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,000
who have defined their business models

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,479
in a significant way around open source

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
uh

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,800
google has done a lot of google has done

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
a lot of this uh

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,560
microsoft is now doing a lot of this uh

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:56,639
github github

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,759
uh is now part of microsoft there

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,400
all of them have a all novelle

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,960
if you if you remember them all of them

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,479
have very significant patent holdings

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,560
so obviously it can be done in a way

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,039
that these are compatible

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,280
the real question is how do you do it

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,280
so

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,560
the key thing the key takeaway for at

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,600
least this part of the presentation that

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
i want you to understand

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
is that open source licensing is not at

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
all

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:35,280
a bar to patent protection um

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,919
but you want to you should realize that

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
if you

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
distribute some code under an open

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,880
source license

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,520
to a person and that code

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
implements a patented invention then you

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
are also giving a license for that

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
person

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
to practice that patent invention at

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,960
least in the context of that code

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,800
now how much farther that can go how

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,360
much farther that goes

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
uh gets into some of the specifics of

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,520
the licenses

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,000
and can be a little bit complicated

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
but you have to understand that you can

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
have patents

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,680
and you can have them apply around or to

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
different parts but

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
that specific that specific grant if you

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
hand someone

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,639
open source code and it implements the

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,440
patent

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,400
you are you are giving them a license to

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,560
at least the claims

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,039
implemented by the code that you that

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
you wrote

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,000
uh so you do have to understand that

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
that

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,960
is an essential part of of what mako

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,360
makes open source work

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
is the grant of grant of rights so that

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
people have

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
they they call it the ability or the

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,759
freedom

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,280
to to make sure that they can

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,599
they can build on that code etc and

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,639
that is something that needs to happen

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,080
need

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,720
means that you need to grant them the

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,039
patented the the patent rights

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
but you don't always need to grant all

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,039
the patent rights

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,000
in all the times so i wanted to focus

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,199
look at this in terms of three primary

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
questions

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,000
they're here on the screen what is the

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
business purpose for the patent

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,039
protection

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,520
what is the scope of the open source

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,800
license and how can open source and

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,440
patents be used

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,400
cooperatively as part of an overall

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,520
patent portfolio

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:32,080
so when i've looked at it i found

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,440
that patents patents are usually used

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,839
for one of these five purposes

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,360
uh the first is this idea of insurance

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,080
anytime someone says

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
we have a defensive patent portfolio

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
what they are doing is they are

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
essentially

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,240
invoking the insurance focus the the

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,399
insurance model

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,480
of of patents what they mean is we don't

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
necessarily want to assert these things

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
but we want to have

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,320
some sort of leverage in case of someone

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,160
else tries to assert against

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,640
us um a lot of times this is going to be

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,839
used

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,560
so that there is a cross license uh a

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
especially a no charge cross license as

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
opposed to getting

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
uh involved in a patent lawsuit or

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,160
needing to pay

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,519
a substantial royalty or a or a

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,480
large judgment a second focus

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
is what i call the investment focus the

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
investment model

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,920
that says whether or not you're looking

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
at you're trying to invest in your

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,959
people

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,320
by developing their capabilities

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,160
rewarding

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,320
innovation developing and r d culture

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
or you are also looking at inter

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,720
external

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,000
finance and saying and wanting to show

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,200
a patent portfolio as part of

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
an overall set of assets that promote a

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,320
certain value for your company

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,519
that's that's really the investment uh

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,839
focus of of a patent portfolio

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:09,279
the third is an assertion

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,800
assertion now this means that sometimes

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,680
you want to have

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,760
sometimes you feel like you are you're a

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
big company sometimes you need to go up

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,600
against your

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,560
competitor and in the case where you are

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
in a lawsuit

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
you would like to be able to at least

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
credibly threaten or assert

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,600
a patent in the scope of a larger bit

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,120
larger business conflict between you

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,240
and another company note that this is

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
not necessarily about

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,760
extracting something from them this is

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,959
about actually achieving some sort of

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,240
larger business objective

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,440
uh the third the fourth is protection

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,440
uh being able to prevent

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
others from using your proprietary

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,320
technologies uh

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,120
this is the sort of the classic model a

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,200
lot of ways

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,279
when people are taught about the patent

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,480
system they're taught that this is

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,880
the the true purpose but it ends up

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
being

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,720
actually one of the less followed

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,079
reasons for creating

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
for creating and using a patent

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,839
portfolio and then fifth

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
is to is

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
in association with the it's not the

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
same as

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,480
assertion because assertion is about uh

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,240
having a tool in the case of a larger

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,160
business conflict where revenue

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
may involve patent assertion but is

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,800
really about leveraging

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,399
the patents themselves as a monetizable

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,680
asset to create

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,839
a new revenue stream

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,240
so are these things compatible with open

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,240
source some

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,800
the insurance you can see here the

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,920
insurance

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,560
investment and assertion models are

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
actually

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
quite compatible with uh with even a

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,639
majority

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
open source protection and revenue not

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,320
so much

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:09,040
but it can be mitigated why is that

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,040
the big reason is that

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
is what is the focus if the focus of

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,360
what you're doing

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,959
is really associated with

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,680
others and what they and and their

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,079
uh and their valuation as opposed to the

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,279
patent

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,839
instrument itself then you

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,040
it can it can be used in a very

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
compatible manner

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,680
for example in in terms of insurance

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,480
the most effective patents

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,440
for and both insurance and assertion are

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,079
not the ones

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
that read on or implicate your own

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
products

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,760
they're the ones that read on or

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
implicate things

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,240
that your competitors or the

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,200
potential asserters will are

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,519
are doing because it doesn't matter if

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
you

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
are doing something if you have a patent

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,519
on something that

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,360
only you are doing yes that matters to a

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,959
certain extent from a protection

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,160
point of view but the only

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,440
real power provided by a patent is the

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,079
ability to prevent

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,040
someone else from doing something and in

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,040
the context of a business dispute

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,720
the power actually comes from preventing

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,760
your competitor from doing something

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,079
which means that

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,680
the best patent portfolio is not the one

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,040
that is inwardly directed

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,839
but the one that is outwardly directed

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,920
and it is focused in terms of claims and

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,680
even

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,839
even the the type of of

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
things that you investigate and file

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,800
patents on

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,800
based upon what you think your

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,639
competitors are doing as well

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,240
and where you would like to have

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,399
sufficient freedom to operate

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,560
in the future one of the companies one

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,880
of the companies that i worked with

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,639
uh has an interesting as an interesting

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,399
focus where they actually create a

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,519
competitor score

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,880
where they look at how much

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,560
is this competitor in our space or do we

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,079
expect them to be in our space

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,920
how many patents do they have how

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,399
assertive are they and they put sort of

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,519
they

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,279
put they figure out sort of a score for

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,639
each one of these things

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,880
uh and then they try and what they try

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,320
to do is they try and balance

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,160
the amount of their competitors products

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
that they could assert against versus

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,600
the amount of their own products that

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,800
the competitor could assert against

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,880
and they look at that as a ratio and

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,839
they try and keep that ratio essentially

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,360
at one

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,199
uh at one to one

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,320
uh so that if the if their competitor

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,480
starts to get

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
stronger uh stronger in that way well

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,839
they build up a little bit in that area

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,320
but that also keeps them from over

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
investing in a particular place because

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,480
really all they want

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,839
is essentially a license for freedom to

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,760
operate

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,040
um i mentioned that a lot of these are

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,360
also other directed

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,199
uh investment even though it is also

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,279
directed at sort of the

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,959
financial overall portfolio value

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,880
there's also that internal

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,480
you want to develop your people but note

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,519
that again that that's not focused on

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
the patent instrument

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,560
that's focused essentially on getting

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
value

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,480
in terms of the the people

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,120
as opposed to the patent itself looking

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
at

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,880
protection and revenue first is

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
if you are if what you're trying to do

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,800
is you're trying to

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,880
prevent people from using your

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,440
proprietary technologies

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,959
then you should probably should not be

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
open sourcing those proprietary

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,360
technologies

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,839
um it's just the name is just the name

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,040
of the game open source

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,519
is not easily compatible with keeping

00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,519
secrets

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,920
and so the best way to if you want to

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
have

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,199
proprietary technologies including ones

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,440
that are patented the easiest thing to

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,279
way to manage that and mitigate that is

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,360
by not having that be

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,120
a portion of your portfolio that you

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,160
open source

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
uh similarly and this gets back to those

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,880
earlier

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,079
uh papers between capos and myself

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,120
revenue trying to

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,959
develop a revenue source out of the

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,079
patent instrument itself

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,320
you can do that again just as long as it

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
is

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,880
not also the subject of the open source

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,959
license because the open source licenses

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,959
require a royalty-free license

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,279
so let's say that you are

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,120
really focused on on some of these

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
things and you want to have some sense

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
of

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
protection or revenue you want to look

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,399
at that

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,320
that mitigation what do you need to do

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,600
first thing that uh this sort of moves

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
on to that second question

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,160
how broad is the patent grant and this

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,679
gets a little bit into

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,120
the evaluation of the the

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:19,199
the scope of the license itself and

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,640
weirdly the scope of copyright

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
so the first thing that you need to look

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,160
at is there are

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,440
both explicit uh explicit

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,400
and implicit patent grants

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
or x sometimes i call them express

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,559
patent grants even if it doesn't have

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
the

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,120
the uh the patent grant language

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,000
let me explain what that means for a

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,120
second uh

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
every every single uh open source

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,280
license

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
has some patent-related language in it

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
if you

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,280
look at the patent statute in the united

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
states they're really

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,400
essentially a few verbs that are

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,840
protected what are the essential

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:06,880
things to do make use sell offer to sell

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:11,280
uh and and import export

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,840
uh in this case usually it is

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,600
used but sometimes there's also cell

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,240
sometimes there's also types of

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,240
making and so

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,480
when they you when a license uses

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,240
the the patent verbs and says you can do

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,880
these patent verbee things

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,160
but doesn't actually say and you have a

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,039
patent grant i call that an

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,799
express license as opposed to an

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,640
explicit license because

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,960
they are giving you express permission

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,160
to do patent related things they're just

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,160
not saying the word patent

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,080
for those where you have an express

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,080
patent grant

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,000
an express patent grant that says the

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,360
words we grant you a patent license

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
to do x y z there are different scopes

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,679
associated with those and i i have some

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,960
language from the gpl3

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,960
and the apache 2.

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
the main difference in scope that you

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,320
really need to look at and you really

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
need to analyze

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,520
is does this

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,799
does this patent is the patent grant

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,600
scoped to the contribution that i'm

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,360
giving

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:30,480
or to the project that i'm giving it to

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,080
um and that is a little bit

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,840
uh that's a little bit different one uh

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
and that can vary essentially between

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,919
the

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
between the licenses the other thing

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,280
that you really need to understand

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,679
is where does the license stop because

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,400
let's say that they're whether it's

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,080
express

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,280
or explicit the there is

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,520
an end to the patent grant and that

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
the end of the patent grant is not only

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
defined by

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,080
the terms of the patent license but is

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,039
also

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,679
determined by the scope of the copyright

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
license

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,799
because the patent license that is

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,039
granted

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,480
through the open source through the open

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,720
source license is not going to go

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,520
farther than the open source license

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,159
so you need to look at what are the the

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
typical

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,679
borders of copyright protection and

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,000
while it's not

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,840
you know necessarily universally true a

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
good shorthand way to usually think

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,360
about it

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,799
is is there a process or network barrier

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
between

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,080
between these two pieces and if so

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,640
there's a good

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,360
chance that there is going to be

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
essentially

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,919
a copyright boundary which will also

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,400
serve to be a patent

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
license boundary as well and so if you

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,120
do

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,360
careful analysis and careful arc uh

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
careful architecture in terms of how you

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,679
have these different pieces that work

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
together

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,280
it is possible to have interrelated

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,520
pieces

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,880
with different licensing including

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
having some pieces that

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,080
are that are patented

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,640
and proprietary and some pieces that are

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
open source

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,440
what about and if you have an integrated

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,840
strategy though what does that mean and

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,400
i think that part of what you need to

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,200
look at is i talk about the 80 20

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,840
rule of business value so if you think

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
of

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,120
this as the total value that your

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,320
company brings to

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,520
the customer there is

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,080
uh there is a portion of it in fact

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,840
the majority of it that is necessary

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
functionality but is not really the

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,760
reason

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,039
why your customer is buying an example

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,440
that i sometimes use

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,360
is the dialer on your phone doesn't

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,720
matter whether you use an iphone or an

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,720
android or something else

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,919
being able to dial a phone number is

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,919
necessary functionality

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,600
if you didn't have that functionality it

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,880
would be a really terrible phone

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,360
and you wouldn't actually want to buy it

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,480
it would detract from sales it is

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,679
necessary to

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,000
to the device but no one really

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,159
buys any particular phone because they

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,159
have an awesome dialer

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,440
it ends up being it ends up

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,000
going you know washing away and instead

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
you're looking

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,039
at what is the integration what is the

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,880
app compatibility what is the

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,559
design what is the form and function

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,360
what are all these other things

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,400
that are actually reasons to buy so if

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
you think about it

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,280
there is a differentiating portion

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,120
that's the reasons why people buy

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,200
and there's a supporting portion which

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,360
is required for functionality

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,799
but is not the reason why people buy and

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,960
if you think about it

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,600
everything below this line can be

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,120
uh essentially open source because by

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,080
definition it is not the reason why

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,440
people buy

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,000
and so it you can actually use

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,200
an open source cooperative strategy to

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,320
reduce your costs

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,240
and your and your time to market whereas

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,600
this differentiating portion up at the

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,200
top you

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,120
that's one of the places where you want

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,039
to look at some of the more protective

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,200
types of ip strategies such as patents

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,400
such as trade secrets

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,000
um so

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,039
when people really get into open source

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,159
what are the reasons why they do so

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,320
and if you look at the different

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,360
differences here versus the differences

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,480
why people get

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,960
into their uh the patent portfolio

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,320
it's very interesting that the they are

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,919
completely different

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
developing a platform for innovation

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,840
returning reducing long-term risk

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
getting mind share market share

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,559
recruiting retaining developing people

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,120
and reducing the cost of product and

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,840
service delivery

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,919
there's almost other than this idea of

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,919
recruit retain and develop

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
developing people there's actually

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,799
almost no overlap

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,600
between the purposes

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,799
why a company gets into open source

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,720
development

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,320
versus the reasons why they develop a

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
patent portfolio

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
so that that shows you that you these

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
are actually

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,840
different and complementary tools for

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,039
addressing different parts of your ip

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,840
toolbox

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,120
fact is not all intellectual property is

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,440
of equal value

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,720
and sometimes lawyers and all

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,840
lawyers tend to focus on

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,279
the crown jewel pieces crown jewels of

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,440
the ip portfolio

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,600
and they create policies that are

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,000
focused mostly on

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,400
licensing these very rare very high

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
value pieces of ip

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,159
and the fact is that most ip that you've

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,000
got is actually of

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:01,840
the supporting variety and

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,880
sort of paradoxically if what you do is

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,799
create your ip strategy vote around the

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,960
things that you don't license very often

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,080
that you want to keep

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,679
as close as possible you actually can

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,720
reduce the total amount

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,360
of your ip portfolio that you license

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
and thus reduce the overall value of

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,600
your license

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,919
and the overall value of your portfolio

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,120
holding it too close means that it

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,720
doesn't get used

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,159
quite as much it doesn't get licensed

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,480
quite as much and you don't get as much

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,480
value out of it

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
one of the one of the strategies which i

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,640
think is particularly interesting

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
we did this while i was a couple years

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,799
ago i was

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,640
in-house at rackspace for several years

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,840
managing their intellectual property

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,960
and one of the things that we did is

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,720
we created we at that time were pushing

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,400
very heavily into openstack i don't know

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,080
how many of you are are familiar with

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,000
openstack it's a

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,400
cloud computing system meant to be

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
broadly compatible with slash

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,840
competitive with

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,840
uh cloud offerings like aws or google

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,559
cloud

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,520
one of the things that we were afraid of

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,400
were

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,840
were licensing requests from large

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,480
operating companies

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,200
i won't name any ones in particular but

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
we had

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
had situations that passed where we

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,880
actually

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,960
uh where we actually had a large company

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,400
that was one of our partners come and

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
say by the way

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,440
even though we know we're partners we

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,960
want you to start paying

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,559
us a patent royalty and we were able to

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,960
put them off at that point

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,799
but this was something that really drove

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,840
our

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:51,039
our thinking around both patents and oh

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,080
and open source and so we were we leaned

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,600
very much into this

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,320
insurance this insurance model of

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,720
pat of patent portfolio building because

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,200
we had already had an experience where

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,120
some an operating company wanted us to

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,480
start licensing

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,159
so what we did is we actually used the

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,760
we released uh we released this code

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,120
under the apache license

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,440
and one of the things about the apache

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,760
license but this can happen with

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,320
others with other licenses as well that

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,480
have an explicit patent variant

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,559
is that uh when you license it in

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
you essentially give other people a

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,279
license for

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,320
for the things that you said for for the

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,200
things that you

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,600
contribute and the ways in which we uh

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,200
the way in which we

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,200
uh put in the the copyright license

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,279
agreement to put code

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,559
code in uh said had it have sort of this

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,600
project scope

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,480
so at the time openstack was a was a

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,640
very

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,320
substantial part of our overall business

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,440
and was

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,760
uh one of the places where we had we

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,200
felt like we had the most exposure

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,520
because it was growing

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,960
growing quickly at that time it was in a

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,200
new area there was a lot of patent

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,240
activity around it

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,480
but by bringing in

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,159
bringing in a bunch of our competitors

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,480
in an open source context

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,200
and with a like open source license that

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
had an

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,279
explicit patent grant we were actually

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,880
able to

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,520
to get our competitors to give us

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,399
enough of a patent grant for their

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,440
licensable

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,840
patents that gave us freedom to operate

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,559
for this

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,039
for openstack maybe not for other

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,360
portions of our

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,039
of our business activities but for this

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,399
one that we were particularly concerned

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,880
about

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,679
the fact that we used it it essentially

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,120
forms

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,080
a patent pool uh that is specific to one

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,679
piece of code

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,320
and that that's the way that you can

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,120
think about some of these open source

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,360
licenses is they create sort of a free

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,640
trade zone in intellectual property

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,440
including from patents uh and we were

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,880
able to do that

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,640
and so that at a later time

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,640
at a later time when companies would

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,840
come to us including some of these

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,320
people and said

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,360
hey what would you think about licensing

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
our patents

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,720
we were able to respond well we already

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,679
have a license sufficient for this big

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,159
bar business you've already given it to

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
us

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,279
and this was something that went around

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,919
some of the

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,399
normal patent licensing models and was

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,960
able to achieve the business purpose

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,520
hey van um we've got a question in chat

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,039
from uh

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,440
junji kato who is at itau a brazilian

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,520
bank

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,360
about some international concerns i'll

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,919
go ahead and read the questions to you

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,159
okay what are some of the cross-border

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,039
concerns i work for a brazilian bank

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,640
and patents is pretty much not is pretty

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,120
much non-existent for software

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
presumably means in brazil

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,559
and would it be a good practice even for

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,720
a brazilian bank to think about

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,480
a patent strategy even without

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,120
necessarily filing for a patent

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,080
i think that it is important those are

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,080
great questions

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,279
um those are great questions

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,000
uh i would say that you

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,399
start out by yes absolutely you should

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,159
think

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,520
about a patent strategy if you even if

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,480
you're not going to file

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,559
because you want to be intentional about

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,960
whatever it is that you do

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:40,399
um uh let's go back for a second

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,679
um you you

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,320
you want to be intentional about

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,799
whatever you do with regard to

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,600
is this something that you should be

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,360
focusing on

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,679
in particular i think that a lot of that

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,799
is going to depend upon where your

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,200
revenue is

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,039
and where you are where you expect your

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,679
growth to come from

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,360
uh for example if as you said if you're

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,640
in a brazilian bank

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,039
uh software patents are not necessarily

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,600
a thing

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,320
i i haven't looked i am i think that you

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,240
would probably

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,360
include some of those uh

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,799
those uh like what we call business

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,159
method patents is also

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,480
not necessarily being very uh

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:29,279
having a a lot a foothold there

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,440
but just as an aside beware when people

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,120
say oh we have no software patents

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,240
or we have no business method patents it

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,279
a lot of times those sorts of that

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,600
software or those

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
business methods can be expressed in

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,720
other ways that

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,640
make them end up being patentable

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,240
including in places like brazil

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,200
or europe or other places that broadly

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,039
have

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,840
tougher or different standards around

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,720
software business processes

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,600
that doesn't mean that you can't get an

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,760
effective

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,760
saying is a similar scope of protection

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,960
the way that i would look at it though

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,159
from your perspective

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,720
is i would say what is our

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,559
risk associated with where our revenue

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,399
is coming from

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:22,080
and if your revenue is coming from

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:25,440
all from brazil and you think that the

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,279
risk from competitors in brazil is

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,279
particularly low this may not be

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,720
something that you

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,519
focus on uh if what you're doing though

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,200
is you say

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,799
all right at some point we're going to

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,559
be expanding into

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,240
a different market we're going to be

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,919
expanding into china or the united

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,559
states or europe or something like that

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,039
then probably what you might like to

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,600
what you

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,480
should think start thinking about is how

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,679
can we get

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,039
into a place where we are protected in

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,120
that new market

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,120
and that goes actually back to

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,919
the this providing leverage

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,360
or getting leverage against competitor

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,200
licensing requests

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,480
either the insurance or insert or

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,840
assertion models

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,720
if you think that that is going to

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,640
happen in within two or three years

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,840
then uh starting to think about that now

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,360
uh is a good plan because patents take

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,799
a long time to mature and

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,960
it takes a little while and a lot of

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,720
effort to develop a tool that

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,640
that meets your business purpose

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,440
uh aaron any other before i move on any

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,559
other questions

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:45,360
or junji

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,360
uh does that answer your question

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
uh choogie i mean okay he says thank you

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
so

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,399
i will take that as a signal that you

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,679
did answer his question go

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,640
go ahead okay so then

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,279
i'd like to take a little bit of a look

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,840
at

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,840
the other side for a moment

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,119
what is let's say that part of what

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,760
you're doing

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,280
is you are you've decided you're going

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,159
to focus

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,760
your purposes focusing on developing the

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,280
open source

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,000
side of your business then

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,440
but you know that you are actually in a

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,520
patented space

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,119
how in the world do you protect yourself

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,440
how do you protect your freedom in the

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,639
face of patented technologies

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,000
and that sort of came to a head with

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,399
with the lawsuit last year by rothschild

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,520
patent

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,000
imaging against gnome uh that was

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,560
really surprising for a lot of reasons

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,359
and the biggest reason

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,359
was that

00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,320
it it doesn't really

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,280
end up making a lot of financial sense

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,680
to go against

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,800
a non-profit that doesn't have any money

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,040
and really

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,680
had very little uh yeah

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,599
had didn't really have any uh

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,280
proprietary advantage

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,280
my thing was actually they were being a

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,920
little bit sloppy

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,680
honestly and that this ended up actually

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,839
getting resolved

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,320
in favor of gnome but not only for

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,960
for their exact things that they were

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,400
doing

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,920
but also for but also for

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,599
all open source because i think they

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,880
realize there's not a lot of money here

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,880
and so it doesn't

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,880
it doesn't fit but for all of you

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,240
or at least almost all of you in the

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,680
context of a

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,119
a an operating company where you do have

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,480
revenues you do have money

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,920
you are a target so how do you uh

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,839
how do you if you are seeing open source

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
as part of your

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,599
growth strategy what do you do to

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,839
protect yourself

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,560
um well i'm going to assume a couple

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,440
things here

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:14,640
that you want to avoid patent issues

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
you want to avoid patent lawsuits and

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,000
i'm also going to assume

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,599
that if you are at least

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,200
if you are trying to drive open source

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,520
in your organization

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
that at least internally you're looking

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,160
if you're even if you're

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,560
participating in the patent program a

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,920
lot of that is actually going to be

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,599
on this insurance model what you're

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,240
trying to do is preserve freedom to

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,400
operate

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,880
not necessarily create a revenue stream

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,520
or protect proprietary technologies

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,320
so what are the ways in which you can

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,320
make this work

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,640
i'd like to say that this ends up being

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
essentially a risk

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,680
management problem not actually a legal

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,680
problem

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,720
and so one of the things that you need

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,760
that you can look at is first of all

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,040
just where

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:14,000
where do you invest where do you invest

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:16,320
and there are particular places that are

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,359
notorious minefields associated with

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,359
patented technologies

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,760
audio video codecs are one of these uh

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,160
places where you interact with hardware

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,359
are another one these are the places

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,440
that tend to be

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:37,040
most highly fraught uh and most

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,760
and most heavily patented

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,800
you're going to need to either have a

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,079
strategy like

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,880
vlc where they are in a

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,720
non in a country they distribute only

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,640
from a country that doesn't recognize

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,359
the applicable patents

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,680
which limits your scope or you're going

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,560
to

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,280
need to step very carefully in terms of

00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,839
how you

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,839
uh how you go into these areas you may

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,760
not want to try and go into

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:09,040
a go into uh

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,640
for example hardware development

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,920
uh without uh

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,040
just sort of blindly and unless you

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,119
unless you've thought very carefully

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,240
about the patent issues

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,680
the second thing is that there are some

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,320
tools associated with open source

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,599
that are not brought necessarily brought

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,040
broadly available

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,480
one of those is the open invention

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,520
network i don't know if any of you have

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,800
heard of that

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,839
it is a patent pool for linux

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,839
related technologies and what's one of

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,920
the things that's interesting is that it

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,880
they actually grow their scope about

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,880
every year

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,320
and you can think of it as covering most

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,240
of the things in a typical

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,680
linux distribution so not just the

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,880
kernel almost

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,480
everything in a typical linux

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,200
distribution whether it be for the

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,280
desktop or the server

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,280
so that means that and there are

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,000
somewhere around 3 000 different

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,520
licensees including many substantial

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,200
licensees

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,720
which means that this is going to be a

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,480
place where

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,119
they you have a known and growing group

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,440
of

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,760
both safe technologies to build on and

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,880
and companies that have non-assertion

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,000
pledges

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,040
and at least broadly oin

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
has said that they are interested in

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,079
helping protect

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,200
companies against patent assertions as

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,320
well so

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,000
that's a good tool the third

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,720
is to have if you are accepting

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,400
contributions from someone else that has

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,599
a contribute and you have a contributor

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,280
license agreement

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,760
make sure your contributor license

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,839
agreement has a plat patent grant

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,920
a good example here is the standard

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,440
apache cla

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,599
it's the one i recommend note that the

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,680
the standard dco language while it

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,400
functions as a copyright license

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,599
agreement

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,480
does not have any patent grant and so

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,440
recommend against it for that reason at

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,160
least for

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,280
any possibly patent holding entities or

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,000
people who are

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,640
who are engaging with your project on

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,640
that behalf

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,520
the next is i told you i talked about

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,560
explicit versus

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,280
express patent licenses you're always

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,720
better off

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,880
if this is going to be an uh worry with

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,560
with a license that has an explicit

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,680
explicit patent license it just

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,440
is going to make it less uh

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,240
troublesome to troublesome to litigate

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,240
if or

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,000
negotiate about if you ever need to do

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,240
so

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,240
uh

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,040
this number five gets to this idea of uh

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,119
of the patent pool the de facto patent

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,480
pool like i described in the context of

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,560
openstack

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,079
if you can get other patent holding

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,960
entities to

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,040
contribute to your same project this

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,240
essentially creates a protective patent

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,079
pool even without a lot of the

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,760
revenue sharing and the back and forth

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,760
and the legal negotiation

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,760
because you create this patent pool

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,560
that's defined by the code instead of by

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,960
an agreement

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,400
it ends up being an extremely powerful

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,680
and capable

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,400
mechanism for managing patent risk

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,160
managing patent risk and one that a lot

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,520
of people are using

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,520
sort of not knowledgeably because it's

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,520
an inherent feature of these licenses

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,319
but if you if you think about it

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
expressly

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,400
as a tool there are ways in which you

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,280
can use it to

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,680
to establish and develop your freedom to

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,680
operate

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,319
the next one is stay away from money

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,160
or at least one

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,680
way of doing it is separating the money

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,920
from the ip ownership

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,960
there's a number of companies that have

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,960
done this

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,200
where they have a ip holding company

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,079
and then they have the operating company

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,560
and those

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,440
are separate and sometimes what you can

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,640
do is you

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,960
there are some ways

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,319
in which if you are very careful you can

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,520
actually uh

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,119
you can actually make a grant to

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,800
a third party and then have third

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,280
parties make grants on your behalf

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,680
so that you actually firewall off some

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,599
of your patent portfolio or

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,280
some of the patent portfolio issues from

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,079
your open source issues

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,079
and that can also like i said keep the

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,440
uh

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,920
as soon as you make you

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,200
make it so that the for example this if

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,400
this open source stuff that you're

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,599
participating in

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,640
isn't does not have a good connection to

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,359
the the revenue that you your comp your

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,760
organization

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,160
generates well then that makes it a less

00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,960
attractive target

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,960
and then finally

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,560
if you are approached from a by someone

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,680
where there is a

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,800
where they're suggesting that there's

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,319
going to be a patent assertion it needs

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,760
to be taken very very seriously

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,680
it needs to be

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,119
maybe there's a work around maybe

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,400
there's pulling out some code

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,079
maybe remove it at least develop

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,160
a non-infringement theory and make it

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,079
and and publish it and make it so that

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,319
it is public

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,680
one of the value one of the things that

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,640
ends up actually being

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,520
very very powerful in the context of

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,880
open source

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,040
is that you're not doing things in

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,319
secret and so

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,319
you actually have the ability to be loud

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,720
and and to be aggressive in terms of how

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
you respond

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,359
to certain types of threats you think

00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,359
about the gnome

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,119
gnome lawsuit they were able to get a

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,720
lot of high level help

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,040
very quickly and and far out of

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,079
a far greater scope than they could do

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,680
themselves

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,000
simply because what they were doing is

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,359
they were standing up for a larger

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,200
community that was larger than

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,000
themselves and

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,119
that is that that's something that's

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
pretty powerful

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,800
and uh something that you should take

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,200
advantage of

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,480
so i sometimes call that the rabbit dog

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,000
strategy where you

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,839
if you if you can convince

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,280
the people that you're actually going to

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,359
be uh

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,960
economically irrational in terms of the

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,440
way in which you go out

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,920
respond to threats they're going to be

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,000
less likely to engage with you

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:55,839
uh and and be aggressive toward you

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,880
so with that um that is sort of

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:01,839
how the the the

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,720
a whirlwind tour of managing open source

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,960
and patents

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,200
both from the side of hey we want to

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,040
maintain a patent portfolio

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,240
and we want to maintain an open source

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,400
portfolio

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,599
and really it comes down to

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,440
understanding

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,520
what are your business objectives for

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,839
each how do they intersect

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,200
and then making sure that you use each

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:24,560
strategy in the place

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,640
where it most makes sense now we've got

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,000
uh a few minutes uh gotta throw it up

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,680
from open for any questions or comments

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,720
it looks like we've got one more in the

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,520
chat if you want to take a look there

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,520
okay fine

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,040
i i will read it while you find the chat

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,119
um

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,440
this is from uh richard wagner of

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,680
codethink in your experience do you see

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,640
features migrating

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,440
from differentiating or proprietary to

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,480
supporting

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,160
or cooperative over time

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,000
and what factors play a role in the

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,079
financial sector sector that help

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,920
with this process in addition what

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,640
barriers exist that prevent features

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,720
from moving

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,480
to a cooperative position referring to

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,560
your 80 20 slide

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,839
oh that is a fantastic that's a

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,319
fantastic question

00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,520
um so

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,240
absolutely i see that um

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,800
there are features that are that migrate

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,040
from

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,839
differentiating uh differentiating to

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,760
being simply

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,640
cooperative simply supporting

00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,800
and you all have seen it everyone has

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,560
seen that when someone raises the bar

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,480
when they first come out with it it's

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,200
exciting and new and

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,160
and something uh something that no one

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,280
else has

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,760
but as competitors try to match it or

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,480
try to work around it or try to to

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,200
develop it

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,680
it becomes simply part of the overall

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,560
uh the overall requirement from

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,160
customers

00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,800
so absolutely this line

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,440
is always moving that's why that's why

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,520
the most

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,040
effective organizations are ones that

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,920
are always actually

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,480
needing to move forward and so you

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,520
should be

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:17,040
actively re-evaluating regularly

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,359
what are the things that are uh

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,839
that are right at the cusp between being

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:26,000
differentiating and supporting

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,319
and if you think through those and you

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,440
see

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:32,000
people uh and you see it

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,359
where it's starting to become common

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,040
functionality

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,880
there are several plays that you can use

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,079
in order to start

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,359
uh in order to enhance your competitive

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,280
position

00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,640
let me be a little bit more concrete

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,000
let's say that there was

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,680
uh and you mentioned the financial

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,800
sector

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,079
um let's say that there was a

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,119
a particular type of payment processing

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,240
functionality

00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,160
that was app enabled that was app

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,880
enabled and

00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,760
you or some other you had some patents

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,920
on

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,839
and you came out with it it was you came

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:13,119
out with it a few years ago

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:13,119
and it started to it was a big hit

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,640
but other competitors they took a look

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,800
at your product

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,880
they took a look at your patent and they

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,480
started developing things that were

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,520
similar in functionality

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,000
but worked their way around more or less

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,839
successfully worked around your patent

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,119
and it started to be that this was

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,559
something you saw

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:37,839
becoming a common

00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,839
a common piece of functionality

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,440
and at that point when you look at

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,240
looked at it from the look at it from

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,440
the customer's

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,000
perspective they don't really care

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,400
in some ways how the back end works with

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,760
enough specificity to

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,880
really care about the differences

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,119
between different patented

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,680
implementations

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
what they care about is the end result

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,240
which is usually

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:06,800
far too abstract and too big to to have

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,240
a patent on so at that point you see

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,079
here's something that was

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,040
differentiating and is moving down to

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,839
the sporting

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,359
so what is your play at that point one

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,440
of the things that you can do

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,680
is you can actually try and drive the

00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,880
commoditization

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,000
of that particular piece of

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,000
functionality by consciously yourself

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,240
moving it from differentiating into

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
supporting by adopting an open source

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,040
model

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,319
an open source model this is one of

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,119
those places where

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,559
you can use open source and the fact

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,240
that you have patents in a very

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,880
strategic way

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,280
for example if you were to clean up and

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,359
and

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,960
push out your code or derivative of your

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,359
code

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,079
and it has those patents associated with

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,400
it

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,960
and then encourage and try and get a lot

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,599
of other people to use

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,400
to develop this functionality as well

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,800
note that

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,480
that no one else is going to have a

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,119
license your patents

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,559
unless they are also using your code the

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,520
license it is not

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,800
separate from the code so that means

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,000
that

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,040
you would still have the ability to

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
you first of all you can drive the

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,319
the direction of the industry in a way

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,520
that

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,599
is that rewards your initial

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,559
development and your initial innovation

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,079
reduces your

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,240
your cost while well if you bring other

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,240
people in it lowers your ongoing cost

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,000
but it makes other people if if what

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,359
you've done is drive something that's

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,160
going to be a commodity

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,000
turns out that if they're going to hop

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,559
on board this community train

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,480
they need to throw away their code and

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,440
it actually increases the cost of your

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,000
competitors

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,040
while at the same time lowers your

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,119
ongoing cost

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,480
but note that if someone says well we

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,960
want to continue to go

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,880
our own way great we're going to accept

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,160
that this is a community standard this

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,319
is great

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,200
turns out that they only have a patent

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,280
license

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,960
if they use your code and if they play

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,440
in the sandbox nicely with you

00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,559
if they choose to create a proprietary

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
implementation

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,839
and compete with your open source

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,480
implementation that also has

00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,160
patented technologies associated with it

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,280
turns out that you can actually

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,960
still assert your patents against that

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,839
proprietary implementation

00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,760
and that actually has nothing to do with

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,559
and in fact reinforces

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,319
the attractiveness of the open source

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,839
implementation that you standard

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,400
that that use shepherd uh richard does

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:51,200
that

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:53,839
uh make sense or any follow-up questions

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,440
uh richard acknowledges in the chat that

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,240
you have answered his question

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,040
um jim jagelski asks from a patent

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,839
perspective

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,720
is there any benefit um from to hosting

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:09,119
the open source project via a foundation

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,119
versus on your own um

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,000
the difference is in terms of the scope

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,960
of the scope of what are the licensable

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,800
patents

00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:24,079
if the if the licensable patents

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,839
are you if your organization owns

00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,640
patents but the foundation doesn't um

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,680
then and but it is foundation granting

00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,480
the license

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,040
then you may be able to to change the

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,720
scope

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,559
of what is granted by

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,559
by putting it through foundation now

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,160
that's one reason to go through a

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,839
foundation

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,200
sometimes foundations are a good idea

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,480
sometimes they are not

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,839
um it all kind of depends um

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,359
so don't take this as a this is

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,440
but this is something definitely that

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,079
you should think of the other thing that

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,119
you can do

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,359
is that you want to think about who is

00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,880
the possible

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,680
uh who's the possible assertion target

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,800
and who's the possib possible assertion

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,760
entity

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,640
uh if you have if there are some patents

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,839
for example if there are

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,839
if if there are if there is code that is

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:26,240
provided to a to a foundation

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,000
then is the foundation going to be the

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,680
patent asserting

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,040
and for some reason a patent needs to be

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,559
asserted

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,160
is the foundation going to do it are

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,680
they going to have standing

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,400
uh or is it going to need to be an

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,839
individual um

00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,920
so i think that the biggest reasons to

00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,640
use a foundation are not associated with

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,920
patents

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,800
they're more about signaling to others

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,920
a signaling to others that you are going

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,359
to

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,240
play according to on an even playing

00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,559
field with

00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:03,599
with them um but i think that the

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:07,040
uh biggest thing to think of

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,000
is from a patent perspective is

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,640
where are the where the patent is going

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,920
to go

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,880
and does this change the scope of what

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,880
is licensable

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,720
great thank you well it looks like the

00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,599
hour is over are nearly over

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,760
um van i wanted to give you uh an

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:33,119
opportunity to talk quickly about

00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,880
uh ospo co um your new

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,559
uh venture to support open source

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,240
program offices if you're if you're

00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,520
interested in doing that

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,839
absolutely uh yeah

00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,839
i i get excited about all sorts of stuff

00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,480
and so i perhaps spent a little

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,880
long uh on the patents in the open

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
source

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,000
so one of the things that i'm doing this

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,280
is a this

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,240
is in cooperation with uh not only my

00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,200
law firm but

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,480
uh but some others and a number of

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,200
providers

00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,440
we're setting up uh essentially an open

00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:10,559
source program office as a service

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,000
so hence ospoko

00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:17,280
that is designed to either

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,440
allow companies uh to to

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,680
develop their to to have us

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,480
have all the the services of a normal

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,480
ospo

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,720
including doing some of the analysis of

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,559
of what is the business function

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,480
associated with particular code

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,079
is this compatible or does this

00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,680
implicate a a

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:40,079
patent license a patent license or part

00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,799
of our patent portfolio

00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,359
is this how can we interact with various

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,520
foundations

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,480
doing code reviews things like that and

00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,520
to do it on

00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,760
and as a service basis uh with with

00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,559
generally flat rate pricing and some of

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,200
the things that

00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,599
we're we're doing for we're doing for

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,480
our clients is we are

00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,839
both doing pull review requests so let's

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,280
a company wants to

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,280
submit something we

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,000
we review the request and help shepherd

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:15,200
it upstream

00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,240
we a number of you may use something

00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:22,400
like fossa or white source or black duck

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:25,520
or or some other code scanning

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,799
that ends up going to a human for review

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,040
that's one of the things that we do is

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,480
we try and get companies that have built

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,000
that into their

00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,640
uh continuous integration pipeline uh

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,920
we get those reports and we review them

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,040
a lot of the idea is

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:45,440
similar very similar to this id of

00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:48,319
a fractional cfo or fractional cmo where

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,720
companies may need a little bit of extra

00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,400
help

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,559
and they may need a little bit even if

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,839
you've got an ospo

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,480
a lot of times it having been in house i

00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,079
know some

00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,599
it's very difficult to get an additional

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,920
head but the work

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,720
still needs to go on and it's increasing

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,559
so what do you

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,760
what can you do this can be something

00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,920
that can either function

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,599
as an ospo or can expand the

00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,359
the scope and the capability of your

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,480
ospo by

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,880
by bringing in a virtual team that

00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,440
that acts in conjunction with the people

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,440
that you have

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:29,440
so that's uh that's at ospo.com and uh

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,200
maybe i'll have a chance to talk to that

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,119
you some more but i see that we're

00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,559
we actually hit the top of the hour

00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,040
great well thank you so much

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,920
um both for a fascinating presentation

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,000
van and

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,839
uh and for that information i'm gonna go

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,520
ahead and put the url

00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:47,760
um into chat oh sorry that was the wrong

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,760
one

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:56,799
my my fingers just automatically type a

00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,839
i am after co um you know i think it's a

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,960
really interesting

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,640
uh uh option for for

00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,119
firms that are looking to build out

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,359
their uh their open source

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,680
program office capacity particularly in

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,240
the short term as they look to build

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,920
um the office or their resources

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,960
internally

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,359
so i you know i i i don't know of

00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,200
anybody else doing that kind of work so

00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:23,280
i think it's a really interesting

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,400
um a really interesting venture that i'm

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,520
definitely going to keep an eye on

00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,280
myself

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,640
thank you so much for being here um

00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,359
thanks to everyone who joined

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,000
um and i look forward to seeing the rest

00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:35,040
of the group

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:51,839
uh in two weeks at our next meeting van

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:51,839
