about about going from

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,920
uh from an open source consumer to

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,640
a strategic participant in uh in open

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,119

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
yourself and and take it away

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,080
yeah so the goal of today um well first

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
of all is to make this as interactive as

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
possible so

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,400
um i do have some slides i do have like

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
you know some comments

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,360
already but if you please please do feel

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,759
free to interrupt and ask questions

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,000
um so you know this is a particular

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,280
focus on a particular

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
area of open source um

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,479
and a particular benefit of open source

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,119
which is its ability to help companies

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,000
recruit retain and foster top talent

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
um and so before we get into this uh

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
yeah um

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,439
aaron did um a good job of introducing

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,200
me hello my name is tobile angel

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,640
uh i'm the founder and principal of

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
unlock open which is

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
a boutique consulting firm uh based in

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
geneva switzerland

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,440
but with clients all over the world um

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,560
i essentially help my clients

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,680
with their open source strategy um and

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,879
their standardization strategy i do

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,560
sort of both um and i operate

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,440
um from a wide variety of of client size

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,599
um two of my current clients which are

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,200
i'm doing open source work for them so

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,239
so it's public one is

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,760
the google amp project for which

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,760
i helped organize a governance model

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,879
and move it to the opengs foundation

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
recently

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
and another one that i've started

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
advising really recently which is

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,800
probably

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,080
a bit closer to home for you all is

00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,000
uh the coil which is

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,280
a spin-off of ripple that is um

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,640
trying to make web monetization

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,920
um something that a different

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,080
monetization strategy

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,959
for the web so with that background

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
let's get started first i'd like to give

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,040
a little bit of context

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
as to exactly what we'll be looking in

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,680
today

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,879
uh which is basically like at this point

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,440
um everyone knows how to consume uh

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,560
open source right this is a slide from

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,120
the talk i gave

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
at um open source uh strategy form in

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
new york

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,319
uh late last year and it's it's um

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,239
data from four financials

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
i'm sorry tell me just interrupting um

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,720
aaron i don't suppose you happen to have

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,000
the debt because i'm getting a white

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
screen now so i don't know if you could

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
actually send the deck out we could just

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,080
refer to it

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,959
oh okay toby if you'll send it to me i'm

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,879
happy to send it around

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,480
yes i just um i just have to share it

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,760
first

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,159
this is really strange i'm i'm sorry

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
about this

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
it's saying it's sharing your app it's

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,560
not

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,799
you so let let's get a shareable link

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,799
um

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:30,720
wait anyone was the link

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:43,840
can view save

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:43,840
now i'm going to get that link

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,880
can i do that i just i don't even know

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,880
where the chat is on this thing

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
there's a little uh icon at the bottom

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,360
that's a

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
speech bubble yes i can see this

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,039
great and i i will download that as a as

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,320
a pdf and send it around

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
because you are not able to access

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
google docs

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,600
oh there's that too i hadn't i didn't

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
think about that can you can you do that

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
aaron

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
no problem but uh please go ahead and

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,039
continue

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,039
all right so let me go back

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,600
to this and to the presentation

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,600
um so for those of you that are seeing

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
this slide right now this is a slide

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
that shows that um you know it's data

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,960
that comes from

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,479
um uh the um black duck

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,680
report um that shows that basically 100

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,240
of the projects that they audited in in

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,240
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,080
contained open source and that's true

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
for financial services as well as

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,840
across the board so we're not really

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
interested about consuming open source

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
now this is like everyone does it

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,919
right this is no longer a thing what's

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,199
more interesting however is looking at

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,440
how much you actually contribute to

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,360
and if you look at financial services

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,319
you see that um

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
companies in according to this survey

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
from

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,919
open source programs in the enterprise

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,759
um

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
from the linux foundation and the new

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,039
stack

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,440
about 29 of companies in

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
financial services contribute to open

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
source only 10 percent

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
of of which uh is often right if you

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,160
contrast this to

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,000
a tech you'll see that tech is close to

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
double that in terms of percentages

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,960
right

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
so this is really just to set the

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
context which is

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,759
that we're going to be talking really

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,319
about

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,840
um how to build a culture of

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
contributing to open source not a

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,280
culture of using it

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,120
right so um and the goal is to build a

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,000
strong open source culture

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
and to leverage it to recruit retain

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
foster top talent

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
there is lots of different benefits to

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
building a strong

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
open source culture but we're really

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,360
going to focus on this today

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
and to do that we're going to look at

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
five different aspects the first one

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,080
is why do you you know why would you

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,479
actually want to build a strong open

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,720
source culture

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,960
the second one is why do developers

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
actually care about this

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,039
then we're going to look at what you can

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,800
actually concretely do

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,080
to improve your open source culture

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,080
then we're going to look at how can you

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,400
make it more visible because

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,639
just improving it without making it more

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,879
visible

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,440
it doesn't yield obviously as much

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
benefits and isn't as valuable right

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,280
and lastly how can you actually leverage

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,560
this visibility

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
um to um basically get a return on your

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
investment

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,280
and if we have time which and and if

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
there are volunteers which

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,800
would be great um what i really want to

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
do

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
is actually um go through a couple of

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
your

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
web presences for the different

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,440
companies that you represent

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,960
uh in the browser just the way like a

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,319
developer would actually

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
look at um

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,479
you know your presence to see um whether

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
like you're a compelling company to go

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,440
work for

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,280
uh if they're actually care about open

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,080
source

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,159
so um why should you care about building

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,440
a strong open source culture

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,560
well there's very compelling data

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,959
uh about this uh the key reason is

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,200
basically that developers care right

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,920
so this is a survey that i did in

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,320
2016 uh using twitter so

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
it's obviously horribly biased because

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
every twitter survey

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
is horribly biased right it's like a

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,160
total convenience sampling

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
uh method but it did get quite um quite

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
a large uh

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
number of of people voting over 2000 uh

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,040
considering like when i do surveys

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,640
usually i get 100 to 200 people voting

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
this you know really means that it's

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,399
something that developers actually care

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,320
about it was like well retreated and

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,680
lots of conversations around it

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,120
and the data out of this is basically

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,399
65 so roughly two-thirds

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,560
um believe that um country being able to

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,240
contribute to open source software as

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,760
part of your full-time job

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
um is somewhat important or extremely

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
important right

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,440
and under 20 actually think that it's

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
not really something that they care

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
about

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,320
so obviously this is a biased sample

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,000
um but it's you know it's a rather large

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
number of

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,279
voters um and and i do um

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
i'm quite part of the open source scene

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,680
in the open source culture

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
um and so uh people that actually follow

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,399
me that have seen this

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,760
um this um survey

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,760
are people that are um you know

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,440
also quite influential in that sphere

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,880
and that belong in lots of different

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,519
open source projects

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
and so it's it's probably the kind of

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,440
developers

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
that you'd be interested to recruit so

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
you know

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,480
that's if you don't really have a strong

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,680
open source culture you're basically

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,680
at least cutting away 1500 of those

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,680
there's a slightly more recent again

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,320
twitter survey that asks a similar

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,519
question

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,399
uh in 2018 from uh corey house around

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
that survey

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,279
it's basically asking the same question

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,279
and you see sort of a similar breakdown

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
right which says 25

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
believe it's it's critical so in general

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,279
you have between a quarter

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,399
and a third that are die-hard open

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,920
source fans

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,680
um and that would literally not go work

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,800
anywhere else

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,920
um then you have roughly half of the

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,959
of of um potential um you know of

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,880
developers that

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,480
believe that this is important but it's

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,959
not the only

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,160
criteria that they will look at um and

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,360
so um

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,160
you know this is you'll see them

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,120
uh if they for example get two competing

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
offers

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,800
um go for the one that has a stronger

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
open source culture right out of those

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,279
two

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
and then again here you have roughly a

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,760
fifth to a quarter

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,760
which don't really care about this

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,680
um and you know this begs the question

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
which is our sort of a second point

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,120
which is well why do developers

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,079
actually care

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,600
and obviously um you know one of the key

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,959
reasons that developers care

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
is that today their github profile is

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,600
their resume right

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,959
um and so there's a lot of issues

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,360
with this right i mean it's damaging

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,480
to people and especially to uh

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
minorities

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,760
um that aren't able that aren't you know

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
not as

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
privileged and cannot spend so much time

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
working on open source

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
but it's nonetheless a reality right so

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,440
this is something that's

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,320
important to developers because if you

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
think about it

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
when you recruit developers and when you

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
when you search for

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
you know potential recruits one of the

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,279
key ways that you're going to do this

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,560
is actually um through looking at their

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,160
open source contributions and their

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
github profiles right

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
so the the same way that it's it's hard

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,399
to explain

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
um on the resume of two or three years

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
where you went

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,399
you weren't doing anything it's pretty

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,839
hard to explain

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,079
on um to a potential recruiter on um or

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,360
your github profile why you haven't been

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
working in open source for the

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,240
last two or three years um and it brings

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,079
up a ton of questions around uh your

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,079
knowledge of new technology

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,920
uh you know are you familiar with the

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,200
the new toolings and new

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,880
processes etc so that's one of the key

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,079
reasons why it's important

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,360
the other reason is just

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:13,040
as much as companies

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,399
um you know look at github's

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,079
um profiles developers

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,320
um do the same when they get recruited

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,440
right they go look at what your

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
company's

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
profile um as uh looks like

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,320
whether it's on github or whether you

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
have a dedicated site for open source an

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,320
engineering blog etc

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,839
right um and why do they do that well

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,279
because

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,040
you know first of all well they care

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,760
about open source for the reasons uh

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
explained just right above but the the

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,079
other aspect

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,560
is it's actually a window into a

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,560
company's internal culture right

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,880
um you see lots of um of

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,440
flags of red flags come up really

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,839
quickly in how companies do open source

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,839
that you can imagine now only worse um

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,040
internally i just wanna

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,160
sorry um thirdly

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,560
um not every

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,680
tech job in the world is necessarily

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,040
um the most exciting or

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,839
um the most compelling um

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
job right not everyone can build can

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,920
work

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,560
on um you know consumer facing products

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,160
that ship

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,839
to billions of users there's a lot of

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,279
a lot of work that needs to happen

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,519
behind the scene that

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,199
isn't as glamorous but that you know it

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,079
can still be interesting

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,079
and um

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
when and that's not the case having a

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
lot of

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,560
open source related um work um

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
you know related projects around this

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
work or

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
that this work itself be in part open

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
source can bring

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
you know can provide intrinsic

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,000
motivation to the job that wouldn't

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,120
necessarily have that otherwise

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,800
um firstly

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,720
for people who really care about open

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
source and who are part of this

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
community

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,639
this is part of you know building a

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,760
strong open source

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,600
culture is part of this whole idea

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,279
of bringing your own self to work which

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,399
is something that's increasingly more

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,440
important to people

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,279
so the fact that they can continue a

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,320
participating um in the community and

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
and

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,839
using the practices that they really

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,800
like that comes from their

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,800
open source background

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,759
lastly um there is a sort of like a

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,560
bring your own

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,320
tools dimension to uh companies that

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,240
have a strong open source culture

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
um you know this is this is something

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,519
for example that um

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,959
a company like facebook talks a lot

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,399
about when it talks about its open

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,959
source culture

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,519
the fact that it's using react for

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,839
pretty much

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,800
um all of its um consumer facing

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,920
products

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,480
means that um react developers that

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,839
facebook hires um are just basically

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
using the same set of tools that they

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,639
were before

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,079
and once they leave facebook to go work

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,399
at a different company uh

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,519
also on react they will be using the

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,639
same tools again

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,800
and so all of them um you know

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,000
the muscle memory the not the know-how

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,560
the knowledge

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,519
um that that they've built throughout

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,040
their job

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:30,079
translates to future jobs um and also

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,839
to um their outside

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:37,120
out-of-work um coding if that's their

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,680
thing

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
so that begs the question of how you can

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
actually

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,880
improve your open source culture

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,880
um checking the time here i'm just

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,360
wondering if people have questions so

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,519
far

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,839
or if i should just go ahead and

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,839
continue

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,839
oh if you're actually still hearing me

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,679
we hear you just checking

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,079
um all right so uh let's continue with

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,640
um

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,240
the third part of of this um short

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,799
presentation which is how you can

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
actually

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,520
improve your open source culture um

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,799
and the first um aspect here

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,439
is that a lot of um the times

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,200
companies are really concerned about how

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,120
they're perceived

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,640
um outside and their image and

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
building an open source culture is

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
actually doing a focus that's really

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,000
on the individual firsts on the people

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,400
first

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,200
then on the communities then on the

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,400
projects and

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,080
only then on the companies right

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,760
um and this uh leads into you know

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,080
small small aspects um uh such as

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
really paying attention to details a a

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,039
thing that i see

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,559
you know that i see all the time so

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
that's just an example right but it's

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,440
like

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,280
you get this email which is you know

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,679
like tubbland20

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:13,360
at company.com right this seems like

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:16,640
a trivial issue um that

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,679
shouldn't really bother anyone um

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,120
but this is the kind of thing

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,760
that if you you know add a number of

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
tiny

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,160
aspects like this a shows a company

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,280
culture that in general

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,400
is really focused on um

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,200
making it easy for administrators um

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
to maintain you know handle the company

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,280
and really

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,280
isn't uh conducive to um

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,559
actual people um within the company

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,520
um flourishing and and and being able to

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,000
to thrive uh in an environment where

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,400
there's

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,679
they're essential like they're really uh

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,440
perceived as

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
really valuable to the company so this

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,200
is obviously just an example but it's

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,559
really quickly a case of that's by a

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,240
thousand cut right

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:10,000
uh where you'll see um for example

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,600
companies that um require

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
uh developers to have their own github

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
account

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,760
and a github account for the company i

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
mean this

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,960
obviously um hurts their ability

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,679
to showcase their what they do in open

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,600
source

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
uh because they have now distinct

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
identities and when they leave the

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,600
company

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,120
uh it's you know sometimes the old

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,679
identity um

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,480
disappears and so it sort of defeats the

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,160
purpose

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,520
well at least one of the purpose of

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,840
really putting

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,880
people um your employees forward

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,760
um and i'd like to quickly read a

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,400
a quote on this topic from tom preston

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
werner

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,080
who is one of the co-founders of github

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,200
and he wrote this article i think in

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,400
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
um where he really talks about the

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,000
benefits of open source and

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,360
uh about um opens you know developers

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,720
and and acquiring

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,280
and retaining developers he he says this

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
let's face it great developers can take

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,200
their pick

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,080
of jobs right now so this is true now

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,000
as it was in in 2011 right these same

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
developers know the value of coding

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,720
in the open and will want to build up a

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,679
portfolio of projects they can show off

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
to their friends

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
and potential future employers that's

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,000
right

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,440
a paradox in order to keep a killer

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,880
developer happy

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,480
we have to help them become more

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,480
attractive to other employers

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,240
but that's okay because that's exactly

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,679
the kind of developer you want to have

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
working for you

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,080
so relax and let them work on open

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,120
source or they'll go somewhere else

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,720
where they can right so there's this

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,200
interesting tension here um where

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,640
by becoming more attractive to

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,840
developers

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,840
you're also making your

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,360
developers uh you know to some degree

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,400
more attractive to others right you

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,679
so it's it's clearly a tension but at

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,880
the same time

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,000
um you're also putting yourself in the

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
position of a

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,919
company that is more attractive to

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,960
developers

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,799
um another important aspect

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,200
of improving the open source culture is

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,760
making your policies less of a hurdle

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
uh it's very often the case that um open

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,960
source policies

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,760
are decided um essentially by legal um

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,559
was the goal of protecting the company

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,000
and the company's

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,280
assets and that's um

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,480
rarely conducive to

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,960
policies that are developer friendly

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,840
and it's often the case that developers

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
join a company

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
really excited about joining the company

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
and then once they have joined they

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
figure out that well

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,039
they can no longer work on these open

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,240
source projects that they used to be

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,280
able to work on

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,760
um and and that makes them sad makes

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
them

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,480
want to leave or makes them consider

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
other options um i actually gave a talk

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
about this called open source

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,799
contribution policies that don't suck

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,799
at the open source summit um

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:25,039
edinburgh uh i think now two years ago

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,240
i'd be happy to give that talk to you

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,280
all at some point if you

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,799
uh if this is a topic of interest um

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,720
and like uh you know a future call at

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,720
some point and if not the slides

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,440
um are available unfortunately it wasn't

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,640
recorded that's really like a

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,919
very tactical set of principles

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,320
um to improve your policies and

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,400
really make it way easier for your

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,679
developers to contribute

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,440
to open source um

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,280
third point is actually make open source

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
part of your whole engineering culture

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,360
right

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,919
um we have a large tendency in companies

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,440
that are

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,720
going through digital transformation of

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,840
um setting up uh you know like

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,880
an open source team or an

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,000
innovation lab or you know really small

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,360
areas

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,640
where uh hand-picked um

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,440
um you know top developers

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,280
uh get to work on cool stuff that

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,600
doesn't cut it right because

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,240
that that's that's that's only gonna

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,240
attract people to these particular roles

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,120
it's not gonna change your culture

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,080
and it's not gonna make your company uh

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,039
more um

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,840
exciting for um external um you know for

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,080
new recruits

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
it's gonna make that particular

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,919
innovation lab

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,559
or that particular team and that really

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,159
um

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:53,279
is is not gonna it's not going to get a

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,279
great return on investment

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,919
so i talked a lot about this um in a

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,440
talk i gave at the open source strategy

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,440
forum in london last year which is

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,240
basically a line the open source

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,279
um culture uh online it with business

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,799
goals right

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,400
if it's if um you just do an open source

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,840
um thing for the sake of it um and it's

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,799
it doesn't have uh buy-in from executive

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,400
executives um it it's not going to it's

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,320
not going to get anywhere right

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,679
it's going to it's going to get cut as

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,960
soon as there's um

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,919
a little bit less funding for it and

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,039
you know if it doesn't impact positively

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
the company

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,159
um in ways that matters to its business

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,200
goals then

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,720
really why bother

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,880
and so that basically means that you

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
have to measure what you're doing

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
what you measure is going to be

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,279
obviously dependent on what your

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
business goals are but you have to make

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,279
sure that you're going in the right

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
direction

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
make sure that it's impacting your

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,559
business in the way you want it

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,760
um and for example if the goal is just

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,600
to

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:03,440
you know recruit more developers

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,640
find a way to measure that and lastly

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,919
um if

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,919
you have to put um

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,520
really in and make sure that you reward

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,880
the work that developers do when they

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
work on open source because if you just

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,520
tell them yes we're

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,200
we have an open source culture we're an

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,240
open source focused company open source

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,080
is great

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,520
um but um people don't get promotions

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,159
for their work that they do in open

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,679
source uh or that work is not recognized

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,679
it's not part of like the way

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,120
you know the okrs or kpis or whatever it

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,320
is that you used to measure

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,640
um uh folks in in your company um

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
it's obviously not gonna work right it

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,960
really has to be recognized

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
as something of value

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
um

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,640
so having a good opens you know as

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,159
strong open source culture is one thing

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,919
um it's not enough um

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,679
uh it's it's not going to get the kind

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,039
of return on you on investment that you

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,360
would like it to

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:10,640
if it's not also um visible right

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:13,440
and um

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,880
if you look at um you know if you put

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,880
sort of open source culture like the

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,919
open source culture of a company on on

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,440
you know two axis one where you have

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,840
a weak open source culture going through

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,159
a strong open source culture

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,919
on the vertical axis and on the

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,200
horizontal one going from hidden

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,400
to visible you can actually place

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,360
companies in there

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,960
it's quite an interesting thing to do

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,000
for example obviously a company like

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,919
github which is

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,520
has a really strong open source culture

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,559
and is obviously really visible about

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
it's going to be in the top

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,159
right quadrant uh microsoft and facebook

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,039
uh

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
also in that quadrant but you know sort

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,480
of like more centered

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,559
um amazon um actually

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
has a strong open source culture

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,600
contributes a lot to open source but

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,640
does a terrible job of making it visible

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,080
for a

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,880
whole set of different reasons um and so

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,720
ends up in the top uh left quadrant and

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,279
a company of like oracle for example

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,480
which is

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,440
um you know doesn't have a an open

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,840
source culture

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,559
at all uh obviously doesn't hide it i

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,120
mean it's

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,559
you know obviously hidden uh because

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,919
while there's nothing to show

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,159
um you rarely find companies um that are

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,520
uh you know that both have a weak open

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,919
source culture but they're visible about

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
it

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,440
and i also didn't want to really

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,559
embarrass anyone outside of oracle

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,000
um and so um yeah so you know

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:43,279
this is um a good way of of looking

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,279
at um you know of where you stand

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,200
right and you can think about well you

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,840
know where would my

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,039
company be in there um and you really

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,799
see then uh

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,880
two kind of movements right you can move

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,279
from um

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
oracle's position to amazon's basically

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,760
which is

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,000
move from a weak open source culture

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,440
to a strong one and then you can move

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,399
from amazon's position

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,159
to sort of like microsoft right which is

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,880
incidentally what microsoft has done

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,159
over the last

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,440
sort of a decade right it is moved from

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:22,159
um um you know a hidden and

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,159
weak position to a strong invisible one

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,080
um and if we you know we talked about

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,279
recruiting retaining

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,559
and fostering talent um and so

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,039
if if we look at this in um this

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,720
this question again we see obviously

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,760
that a strong invisible

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,960
open source culture is conducive um

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,039
to um really good recruiting is strong

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,520
and hidden one isn't going to help you

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,080
with recruiting at all obviously and a

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,039
weak and

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,799
hidden one isn't either um what's you

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,640
know sort of like a paradox is if you

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,640
have a weak open source culture but

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,440
you're smart about the way you show it

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
you can actually um you know it can

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,919
actually really help your recruiting

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
effort

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,279
but it won't last long obviously right

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
um

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,039
the developers that you've recruited

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,880
will soon find out that

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:16,399
you know your old form and not function

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,080
and retaining developers will start

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,279
being more difficult on the contrary

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,080
a company like amazon which is

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,360
both you know which it has a strong open

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,399
source culture

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,919
um but isn't very isn't very

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,360
vocal about it um well i find it

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,559
makes it really easy for them to retain

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,200
developers toby

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,880
yes here can i give a real life example

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,679
of exactly that

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,360
oh i'd love it okay so i one of my

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,480
customers i am not gonna name them

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,799
they're a swiss company

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,559
they have really nice salaries uh they

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,480
just lost the developer

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,760
he wanted to contribute to wikipedia

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,440
which they're using internally

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,960
unfortunately they have a policy that

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,679
says no contributing to open source

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
projects

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,720
that are being used internally because

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,320
of a risk of conflict of interest

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,799
which we all know here that's this total

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,360
ball but anyway that's her policy so he

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,840
couldn't

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,799
what did he do he left he left a very

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,080
nice salary in a swiss company

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,080
and joined a non-profit well

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,799
there you go yeah really yeah i mean

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,679
last year um

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,240
i have funny examples actually in the

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,360
financial industry of developers

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,440
um going around

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,440
policies like this by country by doing

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,559
the contributions that would be useful

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,480
for their work on their own time

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,760
uh uh in the evening because they

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,159
actually did

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,159
need to work for their work right so the

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,200
whole risk there if they if they if it

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,600
gets shout out

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,120
well well absolutely not only are they

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,279
taking the risk but like the the

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,679
protection for the company itself

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,640
um you know that's that also creates a

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,640
risk for the company

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,159
right obviously that's not a right thing

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,519
to do but that's the kind of thing that

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,960
happens when you have policies that are

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,080
not adequate um was um the kind of

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,880
practices

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,320
that developers actually need uh to get

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,360
their job done

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,559
exactly um and

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,120
lastly if you add actually fostering

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,360
talent

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,799
right because retaining it is good

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,880
fostering is obviously

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:30,480
better because it turns

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,880
junior developers into senior developers

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,000
and open source is actually extremely

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
good for that and there's

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,919
um a lot of research on that topic um

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,679
that that shows

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,200
that you know teams that contribute to

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,880
open source um

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,240
actually improve and and individuals in

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,559
those teams improve

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,519
and teams them themselves improve and

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,480
are have

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,960
increased efficiencies to uh quite a

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,640
large

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,640
amount and so um obviously if you have a

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,120
strong open source culture

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,960
whether that culture is visible or not

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,320
it will

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
help foster your developers

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
so how can you make it more visible well

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,120
there's a number of things that you can

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,440
do which is

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,960
they're all actually quite simple to do

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:21,440
but very few companies do them

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,600
one is to have a strong github presence

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,919
another important one is to have a

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,519
dedicated website

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,120
some companies even have also a company

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,799
at github.io

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,320
because a lot of developers go check

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,039
that um

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,519
you know a bit more involved um but

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,480
again

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,480
really effective for recruiting um

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,880
purposes as an engineering blog

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,559
especially when we talk about the open

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,360
source projects that you

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,080
um contribute to or that you've actually

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,760
contributed

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:57,760
to the community um funding dependencies

00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:00,559
um is yes

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,080
nope oh i thought someone was raising

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,880
their hand i can't see you because if

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,080
not you can

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,799
i cannot present full screen so um

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,840
so funding dependencies is actually

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,399
really really

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,440
interesting one for those of you that

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,640
are not familiar with opencollective.org

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,080
it's a small company that makes it

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,360
really easy for companies um

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,120
to sponsor um the projects that they

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,559
rely on for their work

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,840
um and that is actually extremely

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,919
effective

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,960
uh to first of all get the kind of work

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,640
that nate that you need um implemented

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,679
but then also from a visibility

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,360
perspective

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,360
um there's an example that i really like

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,399
to talk about which is the

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,159
company the sort of like hotel booking a

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,279
travel booking company called

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,640
trivago which is a european company

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,360
um a few years ago they were relying on

00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,760
webpack

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,880
quite a bit uh for all of their their

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,279
front-end

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,279
work and they wanted a number of

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,880
improvements in webpack that they didn't

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,200
really have the time to do

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,720
and so they gave about a hundred

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,760
thousand us dollars

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,000
to the project for a year um to

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,760
uh sponsor that work that they were

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,119
really that they were basically

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,679
keen to have um for their own website

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,200
and so they did that and after a year

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,079
they were like really happy with the

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,679
outcome

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,320
uh because that work had been funded um

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,040
and you know if you actually just think

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,119
about

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,639
how much they spent on that compared to

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,839
the kind of work that they got

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,280
out of it um and the quality of the

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
engineer that worked tonight which was

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,919
basically the maintainer of the webpack

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,520
project

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,280
uh you see that that was you know like a

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,560
great value for the money right they

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,879
probably would have spent two

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
three four times that amount had they

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,119
hired for for a specific role

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,280
uh to work on that and uh it would have

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,200
been a lot more difficult for

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,880
of that person to actually get those

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
changes implemented in the project so it

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,320
was

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,560
you know absolutely amazing for this but

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,000
it was an interesting side effect was

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,320
because they started funding that

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
project they became very visible to open

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,320
source

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,040
developers in europe and they had

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,640
lots of javascript developers just come

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,240
bang on their door and say you have a

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,960
job for me like you seem like a cool

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
company

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,880
you fund open source i want to work for

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,240
you and out of that i think the first

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,359
year they funded

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,040
they hired four javascript developers um

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,359
and they really came sort of like

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,720
the european company to go workforce for

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,640
javascript developers

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,400
and so they continued investing in that

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,160
and i think like last year they actually

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
launched a small open source

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
conference at their office and so they

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,880
really um you know

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,400
saw the benefits of leveraging the open

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,240
source work that they were doing

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,760
both from an operational perspective

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,960
where they actually had the code that

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,880
they needed built for them

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,440
but also from a promotional perspective

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,480
and then um you know time to that

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,560
actually having

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,000
your engineers speak at conferences talk

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,040
about the open source projects that

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
they're working on

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,880
and also sponsoring some conferences

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,800
especially

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,520
small ones small community conferences

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,040
which are generally cheap to fund

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,920
um is a really um effective thing

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,560
lastly uh the question is how can you

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,440
actually

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,160
leverage that actual visibility you've

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
done

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,640
and this is the typical sort of brand

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,640
versus response marketing

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,960
um question so for those of you that are

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,119
not

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,880
familiar with those marketing branding a

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,200
marketing terminology

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
brand is really when you focus on

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,599
improving the perception of your brand

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,320
as a whole

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,040
um and you know you don't really you

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,040
don't

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,119
you know have cold calls to actions or

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,760
any of that you don't really expect

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,240
a direct immediate outcome for what you

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,280
do

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,839
and then response marketing is sort of

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,760
um

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,160
you know the really like call to action

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,880
now do this

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,599
type of marketing rate so which one you

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
focus on

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,720
is going to depend a lot on the

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,800
circumstances

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,720
um in where you act for example if you

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,240
look at github's online presence in

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,400
terms of open source

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,720
um it doesn't have to do a lot like

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,520
everyone knows that github is a huge

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,839
open source company um so they you know

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,920
they're so strong on brand

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,599
that they don't really have to showcase

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,640
what they do on the other hand you'll

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,920
find companies that

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,359
are not so strong on their open source

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,960
brand and um you know they can have

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,480
calls to actions have to have a nope if

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,640
you have like an open source

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,240
uh page you can have calls to actions in

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,880
there they're like well if you're you

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,880
know

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,800
if you're actually here to work on

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,079
you're interested in these like machine

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,240
learning projects

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,240
it turns out we have these five machine

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,000
learning positions that are open

00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,720
um and so you can um

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,119
uh you know you can funnel them into

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,560
your

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,119
recruiting uh funnel right um and then

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,599
the other thing you can do is also for

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,520
developers for engineers that are

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,119
in your marketing funnel when they talk

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,720
to you sorry in your recruiting funnel

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,440
when they talk to your recruiters

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,760
is also a showcase sort of like the open

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
source work that you do so it goes on

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,079
both sides um so

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,920
we're going to have time for the hot

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,000
seat and for questions

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,839
so let me uh start with um

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,839
opening the floor for questions first

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,800
so jessica i just confirmed spot on yeah

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,359
i think we're all going to wreck over

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,800
this but um just echoing thoughts that

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,160
we're we're all struggling with in the

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,160
company it's really nice to see

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,240
i i'm sorry i don't know if you got cut

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,680
or if that was just a really short

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,720
statement

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,200
it's just a statement yeah awesome

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
thank you

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,720
um are there

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,720
other comments questions

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,839
do you actually have challenges with

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,359
actual examples where

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,640
people really have seen ip issues

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,240
or bank data or other you know

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,079
private information being sent out

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,480
through

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,160
into you know through open source when

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,520
in the vernon by accident or not

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:47,280
well i mean there was a

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,839
um it was a while back uh search that

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,839
you can

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,480
you could do on github now github has

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,800
actually done work to prevent that

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,520
um not only the search but to actually

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,880
alert

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,520
um open you know projects that had this

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,359
issue

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,000
where you could basically just look for

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,079
um you know keys to like s3

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,160
um instances or things like that that

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,520
were just

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,200
part of config files that had been

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,359
contributed to open source projects

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,160
so yes obviously um

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,440
obviously security concerns are are very

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,720
real right

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:28,480
but as i was saying before um it's

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,359
not because you don't do open source at

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,720
all

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,599
um that um those concerns are going to

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,800
go away

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,880
uh if you give me a second i'm uh just

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,359
gonna try to stop sharing

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,480
the browser see oh here it is you can

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,480
actually see me

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,119
um so uh people contribute to open

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,280
source

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,040
regardless you know this is the typical

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,599
um bring your own device

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,599
at work um issue um

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,079
a while ago um it was impossible you

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,839
know when the iphone came out

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,920
it was basically impossible to bring an

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,040
iphone to work and people still did it

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,680
right and found lots of ways around it

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,319
and at some point i.t departments and

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,200
companies

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,560
had to come to the conclusion that

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,240
people weren't going to do this

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,880
and they were better off actually being

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,680
uh in charge of it than having all of

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,079
that happen

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,240
uh in their backs and not knowing who

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,040
was accessing what on which device

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,480
right and for open source it's a very

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,680
similar problem it's like

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,800
this stuff happens you can either build

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,160
trust between engineering and legal

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,319
in a way that engineering understands

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,280
the concerns that legal and compliance

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,560
etc have

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,960
right or you can not do that

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,880
um and and just have people find

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,000
workarounds

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,079
so i i don't think that you can just get

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,800
rid of the security question

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,560
um by deciding that your company doesn't

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,079
do open source

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,720
i agree i do have

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,240
one other example there and again i

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
think it's a little bit of a red herring

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,720
because

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,560
ultimately it had nothing to do with the

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,200
the banks open source practices but

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,880
there was

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,839
an instance there was a it was actually

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,800
a federal lawsuit as well

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,920
um uh basically a goldman sachs

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,319
developer who

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,240
wanted to uh take some software he

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,440
worked on internally and use it in his

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,119
next job

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,560
um you know quote-unquote quote open

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,400
sourced that software

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,480
independently through his own github

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,040
account by sort of sneaking the code

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,640
out of the bank and and publishing it on

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,079
github under an open source license

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,040
which he obviously didn't have authority

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,640
to do uh and then you know and then sort

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,680
of leaving the company and going from

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,160
there

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,040
again you know that that's not something

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,160
that you can

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,640
prevent by by locking down your

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,280
open source policies it's it's it's

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,280
something that

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,480
you know that developer was you know

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
maybe unhappy that

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,400
that wasn't something that had been open

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,079
sources at goldman sachs and

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,079
and took matters into his own hands

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,880
right you probably increased the risk in

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,079
that particular case

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:22,240
by um not having

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,960
uh built uh a good relationship between

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,240
um legal and engineering right or this

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,160
was like a one-off

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,160
uh someone's basically stealing stuff

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,319
um no no if i don't dominate i've got

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,319
another question if they

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,400
know who's coming in sure

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,480
so one of the challenges we're seeing is

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
that we're actually i'm simon holt from

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,240
jv morgan so we actually developed a

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,040
fairly robust process

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,200
now to get people contributing um got

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,839
buy-in from compliance and legal and

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,440
social media policies etc which is great

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,680
one of the challenges i've now got

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,440
is recognizing therefore the extra

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,640
controls we should have

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,920
and one of those which i see this issue

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,200
and i'm putting it to the floor to see

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,400
whether others do

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,319
is trusted developers and malware

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,680
so where someone can integrate like this

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,839
that happened in npm

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,839
uh last year when someone integrates the

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,520
community becomes a trusted member

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,359
and then actually their whole purpose is

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,599
six months down the line to inject

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,040
and have accepted pull requests with

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,599
malware involved

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,280
then in that situation having the

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,839
provenance and be able to track through

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,400
your build and your deployment to be

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,400
able to rapidly find that malware

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,440
and actually fix it and it's a real

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,160
challenge to get people to take their

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,160
head out the sand

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,200
yeah so that i mean i agree um

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,200
there was um

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,839
there were lots of security concerns um

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,200
was

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,480
the amount of dependencies

00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,960
that we're relying on today and open

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,319
source dependencies

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,599
um but that's sort of

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,040
orthogonal really to um contributing to

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,640
open source this is really

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,240
a an issue about um using it and using

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,880
it in a secure way

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,200
and i think this is an industry-wide

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,160
problem and concern right now

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,000
and obviously there needs to be a lot

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,640
more work in this area

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,400
but to be very honest it's also like not

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,160
my area of expertise

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,119
um i'd be happy to point you to a few

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,960
companies that are looking at this

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,960
problem if that's uh something you

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,040
um want to look into more deeply

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,359
definitely interested i mean for my my

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,520
view i think echo's yours is

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,040
this is evolving it will be a problem

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,920
and we will have to resolve it

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,640
and we can't hide from it oh absolutely

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,200
yeah yeah

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,040
i mean this this is this this won't be a

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,560
problem this is a problem

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,640
um uh i mean clearly improving

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,680
um the security aspects of open source

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,319
code um

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,520
especially was uh you know the huge

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,720
dependency trees

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,680
that uh um you know some languages like

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,119
javascript have

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,079
today it's it's really uh you know it it

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,480
it got really

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,520
easy to to do something a bad if you

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
wanted to

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,520
um that said i actually believe that

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,079
having a strong open source culture and

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,000
a strong

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,280
contribution you know being present in

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,640
the community

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,560
kim probably um

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,240
make you more aware of what's going on

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,440
in these areas more quickly

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,319
and so i i think that that um

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,880
you know again like to keep your enemies

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,440
close

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,560
right um both in terms of like making

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,720
sure that your

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,319
developers uh you know are really able

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,720
to contribute to

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,240
that you control what they do make sure

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,960
that you have a friendly relationship

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,960
with them

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,240
uh so that they don't accidentally

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,760
contribute stuff that

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,920
you know wouldn't create security

00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,839
problems or would create um

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,079
you know competitive problems um or like

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,880
value losing value uh assets or that

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,720
kind of stuff

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,640
um and the same for security if you're

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,480
really embedded in these in these open

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,079
source communities the the

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,079
the projects of which you can see you

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,880
consume you're gonna see

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,000
uh when um you know pull requests

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,359
accepted like

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,040
um really easily from um contributors

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,559
that you don't know well or that

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,319
you know just newly part of the

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,000
community um

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,200
you're going to see these practices and

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,599
you're going to be able to influence

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,920
them

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,079
so if you actually care about security

00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,000
of the open source

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,520
software that you consume the more

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,400
embedded you are in their development

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,400
the safer you will be

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,119
then does anybody know of whether github

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,800
or rather microsoft

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,240
are looking into a scoring system not

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,480
ebay

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,599
so you can actually if someone is bad

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,720
mind you saying that you just set up a

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,760
new account when you but at least you

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,800
can then see

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,160
long-term trusted contributors versus

00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,839
people who are new

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,880
um but let's say your arguments go and

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,880
check their history don't you like you

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,839
were saying with recruitment

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,599
yeah so there's definitely um a lot of

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,800
interest and a lot of

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,920
work going on um in that space i don't

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,680
think we're gonna have

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,040
uh something look like this because um

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,800
that would be very complicated for

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,319
github to implement something

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,760
uh that is both um

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,400
you know like users or githubs uh

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,319
are paying for github accounts right so

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,280
it probably would be complicated

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,200
to do that that way that said they block

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,200
and remove

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
accounts like on a very regular basis

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,559
thanks very interesting we have

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,680
uh under five minutes left um my

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,200
uh my hope was to be able to have a few

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,000
of you volunteers so we could actually

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,599
check your web

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,040
uh you know your web the what presence

00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,200
of the company you represent

00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,480
um if this is something that it's

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,520
probably something that takes a bit more

00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,160
than five minutes

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,760
so maybe if some of you are really

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,400
interested about this

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,000
um i'd be happy to set like um

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,680
one-on-one calls with a few of you if

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,800
this is something that we you want to

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,200
talk about um and see what um

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,079
you know how a developer uh because i
