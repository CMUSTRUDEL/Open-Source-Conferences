[Music]

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
uh

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:22,080
welcome everyone to the call um

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,480
i as i mentioned in my email i've had a

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
few

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,920
questions recently um about the

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800
uh specific wrinkles of of copyleft

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,840
licenses

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,800
and certainly copyleft licensing

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,160
is uh sort of the you know where the

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,239
rubber meets the road

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,280
uh when it comes to open source license

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,559
compliance because copyleft licenses are

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,559
you know have by far the most uh

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,399
you could say restrictive terms but you

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,760
know the most compliance requirements

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
attached to them

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,559
and so you know it's it's relatively

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,160
easy i guess for a company to get its

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,160
open source compliance house in order

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,960
when it comes to permissive licenses

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,239
where the only obligations are providing

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
a copy of the license

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,439
and um you know a

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,840
warranty disclaimer that sort of thing

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,479
but when it comes to copyleft licenses

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
you

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
have to start understanding how those

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,240
licenses

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,680
work when you're making combinations of

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
the copyleft software

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,400
with proprietary software or with other

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
open source software under licenses that

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
may have

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,960
a different set of restrictions attached

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,520
to them

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
and so uh you know given the questions

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,720
that i've been getting

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,759
privately and that we've seen at some of

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
the recent

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,320
presentations i wanted to take the

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,600
opportunity to do a deep dive

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,880
on the ins and outs of some of the more

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,640
prominent copyleft licenses specifically

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,040
the gpl variants so

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
i'll go ahead and share my screen i've

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,640
got a presentation

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,000
uh as usual um

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
if folks have questions

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,399
feel free to interrupt me at any time

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,599
you're welcome to do so uh

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,879
using the chat

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,000
or just unmute yourself and

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,239
talk to us um

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,840
happy to keep it fairly informal that

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
way it looks like we don't have a giant

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,680
group today so i don't think

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
uh interruptions will be unwelcome and

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
i'm sure if you have a question that

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,680
others on the call will have a question

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,480
as well

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
so please feel free to chime in

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,560
um

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,360
okay so starting out with the basics

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
what is a copyleft license

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
uh so this is my own definition here uh

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
copyluck license is an open source

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
license requiring that if you distribute

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800
a derivative work of the software

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
you must provide the corresponding

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,239
source code for the derivative work to

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
the recipient under the

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,680
terms of the same license now this is uh

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,680
this is narrower than the complete

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
definition so there are copyleft

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,640
licenses

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
that require you to provide source code

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,360
even if you're distributing

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
the stock version so the gpl for example

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
if you're

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,440
distributing an unmodified linux kernel

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
to third parties you're still required

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,239
to provide

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
or offer the corresponding source code

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,159
to that so derivatives works

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,680
derivative works are where this becomes

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,879
um you know of

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
greatest moment to companies

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
but it's not the only place where this

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
applies and this definition is also a

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
little bit narrow in the sense that it

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
doesn't

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,000
include the agpl the afero gpl

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,440
which requires you to provide a

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
corresponding source code for a

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
derivative works

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,480
if you're providing access to the

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,319
software over a network

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,560
um but for the most part this definition

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,200
applies to most cases you're going to

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,840
come across

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,680
there are effectively two categories

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,680
of copyleft licenses

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,040
a strong copy left including the gpl and

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
the agpl

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,080
or weak or library copy left licenses

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
which

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
include the lgpl the mozilla public

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
license

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,919
the eclipse public license arguably

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:25,440
and the sun cddl

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,400
which was common among you know sun

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,600
open source software back in the 90s but

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,600
is still used on some stuff today

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,440
so this this distinction or this

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,560
categorization can be a little bit

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,160
misleading in so far as the different

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,280
uh quote weak copyleft licenses have

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,120
fairly distinct terms from one another

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,120
so don't assume from this categorization

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
that you can lump the weak copyleft

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
licenses together because they have

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
different requirements

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
um but generally speaking a strong

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,320
copyleft license requires you to provide

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
the source code for

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
uh the complete derivative work so if

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,000
you combine

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,080
uh gpl software with proprietary

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
software you're required to

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,520
make the whole thing under the terms of

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
the gpl

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
and provide source code for the entire

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,880
combined work whereas a weak copy left

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
license generally

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,880
only requires you to provide source code

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
for

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,759
the for the copyleft work and

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
any modifications you make to that but

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,639
if you have if you've combined it

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,160
for example by linking it with a

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,919
proprietary work then you're not

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,639
required to

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
provide source code for or apply the

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,320
license to

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,320
your own code

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,600
so as i said there are a few different

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,440
weak copy left licenses this is not a

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,560
comprehensive list

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,319
for better or worse there is a jungle

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
out there when it comes to

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
variations on different open source

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
licenses

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
but these are by far the most prevalent

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,440
we copy left licenses

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,759
the lgpl is the most prevalent and also

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,319
i would i would say the strongest copy

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,240
left of all the weak copyleft licenses

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,759
so it's it's similar to the gpl

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,400
but it permits you to link a proprietary

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,600
work with an lgpl work

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,319
so long as you provide source code for

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,080
the lgpl to work in any modifications

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:35,600
and as long as you are linking it to

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,680
the proprietary work um in

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
you know in sort of the the standard or

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
expected way

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,880
um so there's specific language in the

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,520
lp lgpl

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,240
designed to prevent you from sort of

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,880
trying to circumvent the copy left by

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,599
um you know making modifications that

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,720
would

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,360
cause your software to interface with

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,840
the lgpl software

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
sort of beyond the intended scope of its

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,199
interface um

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,599
the lgbl i think refers to this as

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,520
or at least the fsf and their faq about

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,319
this refers to it as sort of more

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,919
intimate interfaces between the software

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
um but so long as you're

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,080
you know using the sort of standard

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,520
interface um

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,520
and you provide um recipients of the

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
software the ability to

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
make modifications to the lg field

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
software and then recombine it with

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,120
uh whatever software you've combined it

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
with so that they're using a modified

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,440
version

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,280
of the lgpl library then

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
you're not required to apply the license

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
to your proprietary software

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
or to provide source code for your

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,800
proprietary software

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
um but you know that's a that's an

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
important

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,360
element of the lgpl that's commonly

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,479
overlooked this

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,240
um you know the the lgpl which comes

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,479
from the free software foundation who

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
are

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,840
who are concerned primarily with

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,400
permitting users of open source software

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,919
the

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,639
the freedom to make modifications to

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,680
code and and run the modified code for

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
themselves

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,800
um you know this is a this is a

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,280
distinction of the lgpl

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
from other weak copyleft licenses and

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,319
that you have to permit users

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,919
or give users the practical ability to

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
modify the library and then recombine it

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,720
with

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,080
with your proprietary code so you can do

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,199
that by using

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,440
um like shared library functions

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,839
or you can do it by providing you know

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,640
whatever you need to

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,919
to to make that recombination possible

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,399
the mpl can be described as more of a

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,399
file

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,200
level copy left it really only applies

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,240
to

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,040
modifications that you make to these

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
source code of the open source component

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,680
so

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,480
it doesn't unlike the gpl and lgpl

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,560
it doesn't um it doesn't reference the

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
concept of derivative works under

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
copyright law

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,760
it just says basically if you modify the

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,800
source code

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,440
um then you're required to provide

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
mod your modifications uh to the source

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,040
code

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,000
um along with along with the library

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,640
um and the copy left again only extends

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
to

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
the library itself and those

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,720
modifications

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,279
and then uh justin collino mentioned the

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,800
eclipse license um and it's sort of

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,920
unusual features

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
in uh in his presentation at our last

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,320
meeting

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,320
the eclipse public license as he

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
mentioned is commonly interpreted to be

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,760
a weak copy left license

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,320
um but you know in in fact

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
if you read the text of the license um

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,320
it it

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,959
doesn't seem too different in scope from

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:02,160
the gpl on its face um it basically says

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,800
um you know the you're not required to

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,920
provide source code for

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,920
a separate software module i think are

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,680
the are the terms it uses

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,200
um so long as that separate module is

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,040
not a derivative work

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,240
of the eclipse license software

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,640
but you know derivative work is merely a

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,120
term

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
from copyright law and you know the

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,200
scope of derivative works

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,560
is you know what causes people to sort

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,839
of grind their teeth over

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,680
interpreting the gpl so you know the

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
community interpretation

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,920
of the eclipse license and how it's

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
historically been enforced uh is that it

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,640
is a

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
a weak copyleft license with a similar

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,240
scope to the mozilla public license but

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
if you if you get down into the text um

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
you might be less comfortable with that

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
interpretation

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,880
so i guess you know this sort of

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,399
takeaway from that

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,760
is it's a good idea when you know when

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,959
evaluating

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,360
uh eclipse licensed software

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,000
to see what the sort of interpretation

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
or

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,480
usage within the specific community that

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,120
produced the software is

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,000
because you know that that's gonna tell

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,160
you

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
um more accurately sort of what your

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,560
risk profile is

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
with that software

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,160
so what is a derivative work so this is

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,920
this is important because particularly

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,440
in the world of the uh the gpl

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,079
um the copyleft is going to apply

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
to any derivative work of the gpl

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,240
software

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,279
derivative works are or the term

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,800
derivative work

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,079
is a creature of uh the united states

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,959
copyright act

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
um so it is defined by the statute and

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,959
by

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,600
by case law and you know if you

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,760
ask the free software foundation that

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,760
right that wrote the gpl

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,959
what uh what is the scope of the

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,800
derivative works or what

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,720
what is considered a derivative work in

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,639
the context of the gpl

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
they will just point you to copyright

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
law and say the scope of derivative

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,200
works is as broad as it is under

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,800
copyright law

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,200
which leaves a fair bit of uncertainty

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,399
um in determining you know what specific

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
combinations

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,959
might be considered derivative but this

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
is the definition from the copyright act

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,440
a derivative work is a work based upon

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
one or more pre-existing works and here

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
we get into

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,240
uh you know the the broad scope of

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,240
copyright and

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
a lot of this does not apply to software

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
but such as a translation a musical

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
arrangement a dramatization a

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
fictionalization

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
a motion picture version sound recording

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,639
art reproduction

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,040
abridgement condensation or any other

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,800
form

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,880
in which a work may be recast

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,959
transformed or adapted

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
a word consisting of editorial revisions

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
annotations elaborations

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,240
and other modifications which as a whole

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
represents an original work of

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
authorship

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
is a derivative work

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
so what is the derivative work of

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,920
software um

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,440
so there are there are a few uh places

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
where the courts have

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,800
have ruled that something is

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,079
specifically a derivative work

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,959
and so um you know of course the

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,519
the legal landscape in the united states

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,360
um

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,200
federal courts also all of these are

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,560
federal courts decisions

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,120
um and in federal courts the

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,320
the opinion of one federal court uh is

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,000
not necessarily

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,920
binding on other federal courts

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,839
unless unless you're talking about an

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,000
appellate court um and

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
and you know then the opinion is a

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,680
binding on the appellate courts

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,360
or the appellate and district courts

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,600
under that court so

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,639
i don't want to represent that these

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
conclusions

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,760
are necessarily applicable across the

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
entire

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,399
u.s federal legal landscape even but

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
they give you a sense of where

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,839
courts have come down on the question of

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
derivative works in software

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,959
and we'll talk about a few more cases

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,360
later

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:14,800
but there's one case in 2013

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,920
that involved you know literally making

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,920
modifications bug fixes etc to

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,240
proprietary source code belonging to

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,480
another company so this was a case where

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,320
basically one company was offering

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
services to

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
maintain the software provided by

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,519
another company to its customers so they

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,480
would go on site with the customer

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,199
and make modifications to the software

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
and

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,040
um the court and i think correctly uh

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
held that

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,399
when they did that they were making a

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,199
derivative work of the proprietary

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,800
software so

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,839
modifying literal source code is clearly

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,160
producing a derivative work

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
there's another case where a company

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
translated

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,399
another company's proprietary software

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
into

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,360
a different architecture so i think it

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,560
was from like pc to vax

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,680
um i think obviously an older case

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,519
um but you know again translation is

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,160
something that's specifically included

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,959
in the definition of derivative works

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,320
in the copyright act so that was an easy

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,920
call for the court

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,680
that that creates a derivative work

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
then there was a more recent case i

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,040
don't know if you all have heard of the

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
company psystar

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,040
they made some waves uh several years

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,480
ago when they

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
you know announced that they were going

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,480
to start

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:39,040
producing uh or selling

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
computers built from commodity computing

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,000
hardware but that ran

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,199
uh max osx um and they did that

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,720
basically by um you know

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,399
buying you know buying individual

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,240
licenses to os x

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,800
stripping out the bootloader and um

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,759
uh kernel modules that that supported

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
apple's hardware

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
and then loading some of their own

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,720
kernel modules to support the hardware

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,399
that they were using

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
um and the uh the ninth circuit court of

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,160
appeals

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,040
ruled that that was a a derivative work

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
of osx

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,399
but the big question in the world of

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,360
open source is

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,880
you know when do you produce a

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,639
derivative work by

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,920
using open source libraries in a

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,160
proprietary product

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,880
so this is just sort of a hypothetical

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,680
custom application a where it's using

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,079
three different

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,839
open source libraries one licensed under

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,519
the gpl v2

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,199
one under lgpl v2 and uh one under the

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
apache license version two and the

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,759
question is

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,440
is a a derivative work of those three

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,440
libraries and what what are the

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
consequences if it is

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,800
uh so courts have not answered this

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
question

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,040
specifically in the open source context

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,600
um there there certainly are some

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,720
cases out there in the world involving

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,199
opens for software

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,559
but what constitutes a derivative work

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,720
of open source

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,000
um has not been really squarely answered

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,400
by courts and so

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,319
you know we sort of just have to turn to

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,559
our understanding of copyright law and

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,319
other cases involving software and

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,160
non-software works to answer this

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,880
question

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,720
so there are various answers that um you

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
can find out there

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
from lawyers who are experienced in open

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,679
source

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
lawyers who aren't experienced in open

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,039
source and others in the community

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,160
um so you know one interpretation is if

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,799
a

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,559
isn't going to work or run without you

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,200
know l1 l2 and l3

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,000
then it's a derivative work no matter

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,120
how it's combined

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,240
with that software another

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,880
another interpretation is that um a

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,919
is a derivative work if and only if it

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,440
contains

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,360
uh literal code from those

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
libraries so if you've if you've

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,400
incorporated a library

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,280
source code and all into um into your

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,120
application

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,559
then it's a derivative work but if it

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,600
contains no literal

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,919
copying then it's not um

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,360
and again this is this is i'm not saying

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
that this is the right answer this is

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,320
just an

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,400
answer that's out there um and then

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
there is a sort of additional wrinkle on

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,679
this

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,000
uh a lot of the analysis gets down into

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,320
the details of linking

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,320
in the context of c and c plus plus

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,000
applications

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,799
and there's sort of this question of

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,520
whether statically linking

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,039
a program versus dynamically linking a

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,760
program

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,640
with a library produces a derivative

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,000
work

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,679
um so if you when you statically link

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,280
a c library into an application then

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,880
the library is compiled into object code

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,039
and the object code is

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,120
is combined into a single executable

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,760
file with the program

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,160
so you know in the end you end up with a

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,000
single executable file that contains

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
code from the library and from the

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,480
program so

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,720
you know there's sort of general

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,919
agreement that statically linking

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,400
a library creates a derivative work of

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
it

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,640
there's less agreement on whether

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,679
dynamically linking a library does

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,760
so dynamically linking a library in

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,720
in the world of c code will copy

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,679
uh basically the function headers uh

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,720
into

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,280
uh into the compiled executable

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,160
but then with just pointers to the

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,240
locations

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,400
of the those functions in in memory

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
so the library will itself be

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,840
incorporated into

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,600
into the program wholesale so

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,760
there has been some dispute as to

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,880
whether um

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,240
as to whether you know dynamic linking

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
is you know is legally any different

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,080
from

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,760
static linking um even though ultimately

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
the functionality of the program is

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,400
going to be identical

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,720
um whether the sort of uh you know

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
the procedural details of how they get

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,120
combined

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,440
makes a difference legally

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,960
and then there's a an opinion out there

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,360
that um

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
when you combine libraries with an

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,960
application

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,799
in this way you have formed what's

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
called a collective workout or copyright

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,159
rather than

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,720
derivative work so a classic example of

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
collective work is like an encyclopedia

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
volume

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,080
where you have several independent

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,559
articles on different topics

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,480
that are combined into you know volume a

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,880
of the encyclopedia

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,080
and there are separate copyrights on

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
each of those individual

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,600
articles and then there is a copyright

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
on the compilation itself

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
and so there are there are those that

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
that

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,799
that consider this kind of combination

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,840
to perform

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,080
a collective work and and who believe

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,440
that because the gpl focuses on

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,640
derivative works

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,000
um that the gpo would not apply um

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,280
would not require that combination to be

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
licensed under the under the uh gpl

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,400
itself

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,600
i i will point out that this is very

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
much not the view

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,000
of the free software foundation uh who

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,799
authored the gpl

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,960
and i i would consider it a minority

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,720
interpretation among those who

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,720
practice open source law

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,960
so um

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,880
my my view is that the safe bet is um

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
that it's best to avoid getting cute

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,840
with um

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,640
with you know your interpretation of of

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,559
um derivative works uh when it comes to

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,600
open source software so

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,799
i i think there is a tendency um

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,600
among those who you know work in

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,840
the world of commercial software and you

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,440
know use open source heavily

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,520
to think that you know that open source

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,919
is somehow categorically different

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:21,360
from proprietary software but in the end

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,440
um courts have

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,720
rejected the sort of interpretations

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,840
that would allow you

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,039
to skirt copy left um

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,559
when when the parties uh or when the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,240
when the software involved was all

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,480
proprietary software

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,200
um and so i'll give you a few examples

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,120
uh to sort of illustrate what i mean

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,360
so this case uh is one that justin

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,360
covered last week microstar v form gen

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,280
this is the duke nukem 3d case

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,320
where microstar was was basically

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,520
compiling a bunch of user created

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,720
uh level or map files for the game duke

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,440
nukem 3d and

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,640
selling them on a on a cd-rom as sort of

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,960
like a new set of levels for the game

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
and they were sued by form gen for

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,720
copyright infringement

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,120
and they made the argument that you know

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,559
we didn't do any literal copying of

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,360
any any copyrighted um work

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,919
in the duke nukem game we didn't copy

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,080
any image files we didn't copy any code

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,240
uh we didn't copy any videos etc

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,320
all we did is provide these data files

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,400
that instruct the game to

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,440
you know place and place a monster here

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,640
place a gun here

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,320
place a wall here etc um and

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,720
you know the files only work

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,440
with a game that's been appropriately

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
purchased and

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,880
licensed by by the user uh and so

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,840
there's no copyright infringement

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,799
the court rejected that um now the way

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,000
that they rejected

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,720
it is like the court's actual reasoning

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
is a little bit

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,600
silly um they basically said that

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,159
they were infringing uh formjen's right

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
to create

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,559
sequels of their own game because map

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
files basically

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,200
consisted of sequels to the story of the

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,240
game

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,960
now i that may be the right result i

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,279
think it's

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
kind of goofy reasoning but this case

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,559
sort of illustrates

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,760
that when courts sort of smell something

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,960
amiss they're going to find a way

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,840
to protect the rights of the copyright

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,080
holder

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,000
even if they have to stretch it a bit to

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,080
get there

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
so you know i think this this

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,159
illustrates that

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,840
you know the the argument that uh so

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
long as you didn't do any literal

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,400
copying

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,520
of an open source library when you made

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
a combination with

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,279
with your proprietary software uh it's

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,720
not infringement

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,840
is not necessarily as as strong

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
as it might seem

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,120
um so here's another case that that kind

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,559
of offers

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,520
a comparable analysis to the

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,320
um the sort of dynamic linking uh

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,640
argument

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,919
um so this this case is a little hard to

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,080
interpret because

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,039
it's clear that the the judge didn't

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,760
know

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,360
uh didn't understand too much about the

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,360
technical details

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,120
of what was going on and there's

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,520
definitely a lot of bad facts in this

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,880
case other than what i present here

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,400
um that that um sort of made it

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,640
inevitable that the court was going to

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,000
side with the plaintiff

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,080
but this was a company who so

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,159
a company that had been acquired by dun

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,440
and bradstreet provided software

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,360
for managing hr and

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,000
payroll etc including a program that

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,159
that did

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,919
w-2 processing um and

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,400
this this company grace offered services

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,320
uh

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,520
to uh customers of dun and brad streets

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,799
to basically

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,840
you know fix bugs and and uh

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,600
etc um in in their software and dun and

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,240
bradstreet offered those services as

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
well

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,760
but they actually didn't you know they

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,919
they let grace

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,320
they didn't object to grace um offering

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,360
those services for a long time

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,919
um but then grace started offering this

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,880
additional service called remain on

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,000
release

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,120
where they would essentially allow

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,279
customers

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,880
to purchase the software from dun and

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,360
bradstreet to avoid

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,159
an expensive upgrade to the software by

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,960
providing their

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,640
their own alternative to the w-2

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,840
processing software

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,720
that um that called out to functions

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,440
within

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,799
the done bradstreet software um the

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,159
previous version done in breadth of

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,520
street software that was

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,559
that was licensed by by

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,520
their shared customers um

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,679
and so this software basically so the

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,559
court refers repeatedly to call and copy

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,799
commands

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,799
um i don't it's really unclear from the

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,440
decision exactly what they did

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,080
but it sort of um suggests that

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
basically

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,440
these were these were commands that

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,120
would that would um

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,159
run down in bradstreet software access

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,360
um certain functions of it and and you

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,640
know the

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,159
dnb software would return data to the

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,000
grace software um and you know by doing

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,480
this they essentially replaced

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,440
um some functionality in the dnb

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,559
software that was

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,919
you know that that had fallen behind in

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,320
the previous version and allowed

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,480
customers to avoid upgrading

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,360
um but you know one of their arguments

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,279
was

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,600
you know we're not we're not copying

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,960
their software all we're doing is

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,799
you know opening a licensed

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,559
copy of the software that the customer

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,559
has on their own computers

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,399
calling its functionality returning some

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,520
data and processing it with our own

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,559
software so

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,159
since we're not doing any copying um you

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,679
know it's not infringement

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,000
the court referred to this argument as

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,520
sophistry near sophistry

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,880
um and and it was infringing

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:18,080
um so again this is very similar to

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
arguments that that get made regularly

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,279
and seriously in

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,080
in the context of open source that well

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,640
if we're not if we're not actually

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,600
um copying any portion of your software

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,760
we're merely

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,799
you know linking to it opening it and

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,080
using it

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,440
that um you know it's not it's not

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,679
a derivative work and you know i think

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,039
this case illustrates the courts have

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,720
rejected that

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,720
and and may well in the open source

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,039
context as well

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,120
and then going back to the psystar case

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,320
i summarized this before

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,840
but again scistar had a strong argument

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,760
that they really hadn't

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
made any you know they hadn't copied any

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,919
apple software

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,720
um the they they would purchase

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,760
copies of os x um install it on a

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,679
computer

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,600
then take out um certain apple programs

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,440
or kernel modules and replace them with

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,279
their own in order to get the software

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,960
working on their hardware

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,320
um but uh the court held

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,600
without without too much trouble um

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,919
that you know basically these these

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,919
uh this recombination of apple software

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,880
with their own software was a derivative

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,240
work

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
and you know this is actually one of the

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,640
areas kernel modules are one of the

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,840
areas

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,840
of sort of

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,080
you know the hottest dispute around

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,880
derivative works the linux the linux

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,919
kernel

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,120
um has an interface for

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,960
loading uh separate kernel modules

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,159
to into memory um you know at run time

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,919
in order to provide hardware drivers and

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,960
and other things um and and there are

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,399
many companies out there particularly

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,440
companies that provide

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:12,640
virtualization or or um

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,880
embedded hardware devices um like

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,720
routers etc that you know have

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,000
proprietary kernel modules

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,559
um combined with the linux kernel and

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,760
you know it there's there's a lot of

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,960
agreement actually

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,360
among you know the lawyers who who

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,399
uh represent those companies that this

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,279
does not create a

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,840
uh derivative working linux kernel uh

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,120
but i

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,880
you know i find it very difficult to um

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,080
separate that uh um that situation from

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,679
this one

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
because it's it's really almost

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,279
identical except that you know

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,440
neither of these programs is open source

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
software

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
so the point of going through that

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,159
exercise is just

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,600
there are there are a lot of there are a

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,120
lot of arguments

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,760
for um you know for

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,200
trying to get around the the terms of

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,519
copyleft licenses

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,720
in specific situations you know and a

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,200
lot of companies

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,799
have decided that they really really

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,559
don't want to do the work of

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,880
writing their own software when when a

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,360
gpl or lgpl

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
application is available and so they you

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,200
know they use

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,760
these um they use these arguments to

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
sort of

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,679
avoid uh or to argue that you know

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,279
they're

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,360
they're not infringing and above board

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,320
uh and a lot of a lot of companies get

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,080
away with it

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,080
um you know in the sense that there's

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,679
just not a ton of enforcement of open

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,279
source licenses going on

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,760
out there at any given time

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,480
although you're less likely to get away

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,000
with it if

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,080
if you're using a package that's

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,760
produced by you know a commercial

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,320
software company that just happens to

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
make

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,760
some of their software open source

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,360
versus um

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,559
versus uh you know a

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,440
sort of non-profit volunteer development

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,960
community

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,000
um but um you know

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,840
i think by far the safest route is if

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,159
you're gonna be using gpl lgpl

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,880
software um in your applications then

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,919
you know stick with the the

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,039
interpretation of

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,159
the free software foundation um that

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,360
if you are combining that software

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,000
um in any way you know through linking

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,200
or by literal copying with with your

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,559
application that you've created

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,679
derivative work

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,440
the exception there is um everyone

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,480
seems to agree that if you are merely

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,279
uh interfacing with uh with

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,720
copylefted software through operating

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,399
system calls

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,720
um so in in the world of unix this might

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,559
include fork and exec or uh pipes um

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
but basically if you've got two separate

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,360
applications running

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
on the operating system and they're

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,279
merely communicating with each other

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
through sort of standard operating

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,679
system functions

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,960
um that you haven't created a derivative

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,720
work you're merely

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,159
you know you're merely interoperating

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,600
with the software so

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,240
everyone including the free software

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,679
foundation agrees that that does not

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,840
cause the derivative work to be made

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,159
uh i see uh junji

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,399
you have a question or a comment in the

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,799
chat but i can't read it because it is

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,440
in

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,440
portuguese

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,279
was that not for us okay um

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,000
no problem uh okay so moving to

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,159
uh uh the question of what is

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,880
distribution of software so

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,080
um the question of what is a derivative

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
work of software

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,320
is important because it tells you

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,640
whether uh

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,360
whether the software that you've

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,200
combined

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,519
with open source software needs to be

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,360
licensed under an open source license

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,000
the question of distribution

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,079
um tells you basically whether you are

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,040
required to provide source code

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,720
either for your uh derivative work or

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,320
just for the open source components that

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,079
you're using in the case of

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,399
a weaker copy left license so

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,560
across the board with the exception of

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,919
the afero gpl

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,119
every copy left open source license

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:35,040
uh only requires you

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,359
to provide source code or

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,320
you know comply in other regards with

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,720
the license

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,000
if you're distributing the software to a

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,919
third party

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,399
so you can for example uh take a gpl

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,200
application combine it with proprietary

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,079
software

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,760
within your own organization provide

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,040
that software to your

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,800
employees run that software on your

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,160
servers and have customer interface

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,680
with that software over a network

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,000
and because you haven't distributed

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,520
a copy of the software whether in source

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,079
or object code form

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,280
to a third party you're not required to

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,680
license your software

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,640
under the same license and you're not

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,920
required to provide

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,079
source code so again this is

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,000
these are interpretations that are that

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,280
are consistent across

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,520
the open source landscape um

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,359
so a question yeah please

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,960
yeah quick question interesting one and

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,960
when you've got large conglomerates

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,520
where they're actually an umbrella of

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,440
various global companies um i actually

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,160
work with jp morgan and i think we're 21

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,320
different country companies worldwide

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,240
is that seen as distribution throughout

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,119
that company

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,839
uh that is a good question and one i

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,440
will get to

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,599
a little bit later unfortunately the

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,040
answer is a little bit unclear

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,440
um but um but i do i do have some slides

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,800
on specifically that question

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,720
yeah and the follow-up would be of

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,560
course spin-offs and breakups where you

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,800
get regulators spinning off part of the

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
firm

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,400
most likely but um we'll let's get into

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,920
that in a little bit

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,560
um it's it's probably my next slide um

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,000
so uh so we're all where this question

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,640
of distribution comes from

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
is again the copyright act so under the

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,280
copyright act

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,760
the owner of a copyright has an

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,320
exclusive right to distribute copies

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
of their copyrighted works but

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,720
distribution itself

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,040
is not defined

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,040
and as i said the terms of copy-left

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,480
licenses with the exclusion of the

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,400
agpl only apply

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,880
if you're distributing the software

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,480
whether it's a source or object code

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,960
so distribution becomes an issue um if

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,960
you're hiring third-party contractors to

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,160
modify gpl software or

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,520
as simon pointed out um shipping

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,839
gpl software um between

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,760
organizations within the the same

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,960
corporate umbrella structure

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,440
uh or um if you're determining you know

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,880
when

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,599
copyleft should be you know incorporated

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,640
into a sas

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,960
product uh so there is a

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,079
there is a thorough analysis of all of

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,640
these questions

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,160
in this article that i've linked to here

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,320
by heather meeker heather meeker is an

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,079
open source lawyer has been working

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,320
uh in the field for a long time she

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,480
works for a firm called oh melvini myers

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,839
um she's written a book called open

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,880
source for business where

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,160
um you know a variant of this article

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,640
is is reproduced as well um

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,400
but if you want to if you want a really

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,839
thorough analysis of

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,280
what distribution means under

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,800
the law then it's that's a great place

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,400
for you to start

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,640
unfortunately unfortunately

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,960
she does not have many more answers for

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,320
you than i will but she does have some

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,000
suggestions for strategies for sort of

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,599
shoring up an argument

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,160
that um a particular distribution or

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,800
a particular arrangement with a company

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,560
is

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,280
um or an affiliate etc is not

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,280
distribution

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,480
um so uh

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,160
what is distribution of software uh

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,720
again this is something that

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,680
um is not defined by open source

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,520
licenses

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,040
um in particular although some might

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,320
have specific terms that

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,480
that touch on this um

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,240
or or that give a little bit of

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,119
additional color under those particular

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,599
licenses

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
um but generally you have to turn to

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,119
copyright law

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,000
to determine what the distribution is um

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,119
and again

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,560
though copyright law reserves uh the

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,720
exclusive rate of distribution of the

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,160
copyright owner it does not say

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,599
what distribution is so things that are

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,520
definitely distribution

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,720
if you provide a copy of open source

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
software whether in

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,000
executable or source code form to a

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,960
customer

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to a partner that is not part of your

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,000
company

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,520
um or any other third party um

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,359
and you know in a way that's sort of

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,640
like uh

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,720
you're selling a product or etc it's a

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,040
sort of public distribution then

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,480
you have you've definitely distributed

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,240
the software

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,280
um you can be pretty sure that if you

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,960
have an on-premises

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,440
offering that you deliver to a customer

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,680
and

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,000
and they install or you install on their

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,359
premises on their servers etc

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,760
and it incorporates uh copyleft software

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,359
you you can bet that's a distribution as

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,880
well

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,079
and then a a third one that that is

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,200
um you know a little less obvious but

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,839
an important consideration is

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,359
if you're using open source uh copyleft

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,280
open source software

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,400
um in your client-side javascript

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,119
uh for you know a website or for a

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,640
web-based

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,520
product then

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,560
that uh that javascript is going to be

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,079
downloaded by

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,119
the user's browser um and run there

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,839
uh and so it's a pretty safe bet as well

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,319
that that would be a distribution of the

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,319
software

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,720
um now generally speaking

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,040
um you know i think this is typically

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,920
only going to be a distribution of

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,240
uh of the open source or the you know

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,680
the client-side javascript software

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,640
it is not going to affect um the license

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,720
of

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,319
software running on the on the server

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,440
and the back end

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,160
now i suppose that it's possible that

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,960
that there may be some configurations of

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,800
software

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,319
or some combinations of server and

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,760
client-side software

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,680
where that would not be the case and

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,920
they're all one work um

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,760
but um you know that would that would be

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,720
getting down into the details that you

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,839
know we don't have here

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,839
things that are definitely not

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,839
distribution providing copies of open

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,280
source software to different employees

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,119
within the same company

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,359
now here we're talking about actual

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,760
employees not necessarily

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,560
independent contractors who look for all

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,920
the world like

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,480
employees which is a question we'll get

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,200
into in a second

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,119
and then using an open source library or

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,599
open source application on the server

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,079
side of a company hosted

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,760
software as a service offering again

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,960
generally speaking

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,400
if you have not distributed a copy of

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,560
the um of either the

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,000
copyleft software or derivative work of

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,760
the copyleft software

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,359
then you have not triggered the copyleft

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,880
obligation under

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,880
the applicable open source license

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,119
what is probably distribution um

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,359
providing copies of open source software

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,520
to affiliates that are not

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,640
owned or not in common ownership with

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,200
your company

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:26,640
or minority owned subsidiaries um

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,760
of you know of a company so you know if

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,960
if the company is controlled majority by

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,520
someone else

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,319
then the argument gets a lot stronger

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,440
that

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,440
you've made a distribution

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,400
and acquisition of modified open source

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,200
software or just open source software um

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,160
as as part of a merger of two companies

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,880
where a company is

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,440
you know one company is sold to another

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,800
um

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,240
generally speaking um i would expect

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,760
that that would be

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,280
um a distribution

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,599
uh so heather meeker

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,040
concludes in that article and i agree

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,119
that providing copies

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,240
of open source software to holy or

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,599
majority owned

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,040
subsidiaries or i guess companies

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,280
under common ownership with

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,960
you know a company that majority owns

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,359
both of them

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,280
i would not expect that to be considered

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,000
a distribution

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,440
but would be you know equivalent i would

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
think to providing

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,280
uh software between employees of the

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,400
same company

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,800
um now whether your specific

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,240
corporate structure uh looks more like

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,800
this or

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,760
um includes as as might be the case

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,599
particularly with

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,839
foreign um foreign subsidiaries

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,960
uh might involve some minority owned

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,079
companies

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,160
um that's uh that is a question

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,440
uh for you for you to to worry about

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,560
with your counsel

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,560
um now it's worth saying that

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,400
you know there's not necessarily a

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,359
massive risk

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,160
involved if you have you know if you're

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,280
distributing

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,319
software to uh you know

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,079
an affiliate and

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,040
the and it turns out to be a

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:26,880
distribution under a copyleft license

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:30,319
because you know all that that means is

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,359
that that affiliate has the legal right

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,560
under the license

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,680
to distribute that software

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,720
under the terms of the license now

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,680
practically speaking are they going to

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,520
do that

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,720
um you know my guess is in most

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,160
circumstances

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,640
the the interests of your two companies

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,119
would be

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,760
aligned in that you know nobody would

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,240
benefit

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,359
from them distributing that software

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,960
unless there is

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,680
unless there is some kind of dispute and

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,880
they decide to get you know to get ugly

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,920
um it's merely a license uh to do that

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,040
but um so i think i think that the

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,960
actual risk in many

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,240
circumstances we might you know be

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,960
concerned about here

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,319
is is mitigated by by those practical

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,079
considerations but

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,680
um uh it is it is likely it would be a

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,520
distribution if you're talking about

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,319
a company that is not under common

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,599
majority ownership

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,319
uh so what about independent contractors

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,720
um so distribution to an independent

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:37,280
contractor whether they're an individual

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:40,400
or a company whether it's on or off site

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,880
i think you have to assume is

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,440
distribution now i realize the question

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,839
of

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,280
individual independent contractors you

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,880
know working on site is a

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,000
is a particular concern for a lot of our

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,280
members

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,680
um it's so but you know there's

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,880
no there's nothing that i'm aware of in

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,400
the copyright

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,440
law or in or in cases um

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,640
that suggests that

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,200
an independent contractor who is working

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,599
you know 40 hours a week at your company

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,400
is anything other than a third party

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,960
uh for the purposes of distribution um

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,359
but

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,000
there are a couple of factors that

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,280
suggest

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,680
that um that actually this this may not

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,200
be

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,720
distribution um at least in the context

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,200
of the gpl

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,440
uh so the free software foundation um

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,480
has an entry an faq entry on their

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,520
website

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,359
um that uh that suggests

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,640
that they're only concerned with

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,160
off-site distribution

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,400
now i'm going to go ahead and bring up

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,520
that entry so

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,200
in their faq the fsf says is making and

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,920
using multiple copies within one

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,000
organization or company distribution

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,760
no in that case the organization is just

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,280
making copies for itself as a

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,040
consequence a company or other

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,960
organization can develop a modified

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,520
version and install that version through

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,599
its own

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,640
facilities without giving the staff

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,160
permission to

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,480
release that modified version to

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,480
outsiders however

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,119
when the organization transfers copies

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,119
to other organizations or individuals

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,839
that is distribution in particular

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:22,559
providing copies to contractors for use

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:25,040
off-site is distribution so

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,160
this is just the fsf's view the fsf

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,520
wrote the gpl

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,040
but ultimately you know that

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,760
what they think is not necessarily um

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,200
going to matter if you're dealing with

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,680
somebody else's

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,720
gpl license software they only wrote the

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,960
license but what

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,640
what the license itself says is what

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,079
what a judge would be looking at if this

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,280
was ever to come to

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:52,720
litigation so um

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,839
it's uh so um you know

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,640
the the fsf seems to consider whether

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,800
you are

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,079
uh using the software on or off site to

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,480
be relevant

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,520
um so they that would seem to suggest

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,720
they don't think that

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,680
um providing copies of gpl software

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,200
to a contractor who's working within the

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,400
four walls of your company to be

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,680
distribution

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,680
that is only their opinion

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,319
now there's also an argument presented

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,520
in heather meeker's paper

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:27,119
that distribution does not

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,880
include private distribution under the

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,640
copyright act does not include

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:36,000
private limited distribution

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,720
so basically in other words um

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
so what distribution and i'll let me

00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,359
just go ahead and bring up the copyright

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,359
act again because

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,200
um

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,200
because it's relevant

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,839
let's see if i've got the right now

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,160
okay so if you look at the third so

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,520
these are the

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,200
these are the exclusive rights of a

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,240
copyright holder under the united states

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,240
copyright act

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,000
um and what item three here says

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,640
is it's the exclusive right of the

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,760
copyright owner to distribute copies of

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,720
the copyrighted work

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,440
to the public by sale or other transfer

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,520
of ownership by rental lease or lending

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,880
so if if you focus on

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,520
that to the public element then

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,319
there's an argument that providing

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,200
copies

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,880
of you know a copyrighted work that you

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,040
have a license to

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,000
to a third party in a private limited

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,640
way

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,760
is not a distribution within the meaning

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,280
of the copyright act

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,760
so um that's

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,599
that is you know an argument that your

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,000
legal counsel can consider

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,880
in making a determination about what the

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,200
risk is

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,200
in providing you know open source

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,640
software modified open source software

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,880
to a particular

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,920
third party contractor whether inside or

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,559
outside

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,559
your company

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,319
but the the answer is not is not 100

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,359
clear from the law

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,599
um so

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,280
again this the the concerns around

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,480
distribution are somewhat mitigated by

00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,800
the fact that you know

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,160
distribution merely means that the

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,800
license requires

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,640
um that you give the recipient of the

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,599
software a license and the copy of the

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,680
source code

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,520
uh it does not mean that the source code

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,960
must be published so it's a common

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,160
misunderstanding that

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,640
the gpl in particular um says that if

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
you

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,680
you know if you're if you're

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,240
distributing

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,400
open source software or gpl software

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,720
then you're required to

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,400
make your version of it publicly

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,920
available and that's not the case you're

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,720
only required to

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,599
provide the source code to recipients of

00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:16,559
the software from you

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:19,440
um in the context of gpl

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:22,240
you know the recipient having a license

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,720
to redistribute the software um

00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,079
you're not allowed to constrain that but

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,599
it doesn't preclude professional

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,200
consequences so

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,000
you know if a contractor goes and

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,040
distributes gpl software that you

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,240
don't want it to um you can still fire

00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,839
them

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,079
um and it's worth pointing out

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,160
and this is a really significant point

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,920
so i want to emphasize it

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,280
gpl version 3 does away with this

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,760
uncertainty

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,800
it specifically provides that you can

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
distribute

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,079
uh gpl software to

00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,920
a third party contractor whether inside

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,559
or outside your organization

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,440
to either make modifications exclusively

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,160
for you

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,760
or to run the software exclusively for

00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,079
you so for example

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,359
um if you have a third-party hosting

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,520
provider

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:16,720
and you're and you're running hosted sas

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:19,359
software that includes gpl software

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,280
as long as you you know have contractual

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,760
terms that require that

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,160
you know they provide this software the

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,480
modifications only for your company

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:33,359
then um you're not required to

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,480
permit them to distribute the software

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,160
further

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,319
um so uh this is a problem that is

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,000
essentially not a problem under gpl

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,640
version 3.

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,920
now for better or worse gpl version 3 is

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,440
not as popular yet as gpl version 2.

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,440
there was a fair amount of controversy

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,200
when gplv3 was first released

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,520
around certain provisions that i'll talk

00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,640
about in a little bit

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,040
and so its uptake was somewhat limited

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,640
in the beginning um significantly the

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,079
linux kernel project

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,040
um decided not to adopt uh gpl version

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,400
three

00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:15,920
and so um you know so

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,319
this isn't going to apply there but

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,400
there's a lot of software a lot of gpl

00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,760
version 2 software out in the world

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:27,280
that is um that is licensed uh

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,200
under gpl version 2 or later or gbl

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,559
version 2 plus

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:36,319
which is there's a sort of standard way

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:39,680
set out in the in gpl version 2 for

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,359
signifying that recipients of

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,720
software that you wrote and licensed

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,680
under gplv2

00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,240
are permitted to use the software under

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,559
um

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,839
a later version of the license uh

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,880
published by the free software

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,960
foundation

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,960
and so um if you are using software that

00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,400
is licensed with that

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,200
uh particular marker gpl version two or

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,000
later

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,200
then you have permission from the

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,520
copyright owners

00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,599
to use that software under the terms of

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,240
gpl version three

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,960
and therefore you have the right to get

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,760
around

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,119
this uncertainty around uh what is

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,480
distribution when it comes to

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,760
third-party contractors

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,640
so this is something that is

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,280
you know should be part of your analysis

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,839
when

00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,640
you know determining whether to use gpl

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,960
version 2

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,640
software in in the context where you're

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,160
going to have to make it available to

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,079
third-party contractors

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,079
because if you can upgrade the license

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,079
to version 3 then you're in the clear

00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,200
any questions about distribution

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:58,240
all right moving on to compatibility

00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,319
um so uh license compatibility

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,839
meaning uh compatibility between

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:05,040
different open source licenses

00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,280
is basically only an issue when

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,119
copyleft licenses are involved and

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,440
that's because

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,880
unlike permissive licenses copyleft

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,160
licenses

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,240
require that derivative works be

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,480
made available under the same terms so

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,160
permissive licenses generally

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,000
as long as you are complying with the

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,400
terms of the permissive license

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,400
it doesn't matter how you license you

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,000
know the combination of that permissive

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,520
license code with

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,480
your own software but um copyleft

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,200
licenses have an opinion about that um

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,799
and so

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:44,000
an incompatibility happens when um

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:45,200
when you have you know a copy copyleft

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,280
software

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:52,400
a and software under any other license

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,440
that purports to restrict

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,680
um what is done with the combination

00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,960
um in a way that is incompatible with

00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,799
the the copyleft

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,440
software um so the gpl in particular

00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,880
says

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,160
um you you cannot uh impose

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:13,839
any additional restrictions on licensees

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,760
um of the gpl software or a derivative

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,200
work of the gpl software

00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,720
so if you're trying to use gpl software

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,240
with software under a license that

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,680
contains a restriction that does not

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,280
appear in the gpl

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:30,079
then you have an incompatibility and um

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,040
and the result would infringe both

00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,280
licenses

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,440
arguably because you've combined them

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,400
with licenses they're incompatible with

00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,440
so the most common example of this or

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,880
the most

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,559
the example that's probably of most

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,960
concern is

00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,720
gbl version 2 is not compatible or not

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,240
considered to be compatible with

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,280
apache version 2 because apache version

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,599
2 contains

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,599
a defensive termination

00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,119
provision relating to its patent license

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,720
that is

00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:06,160
more restrictive than any term in gpl v2

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,599
so you know these these compa

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,280
incompatibilities are something to keep

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,319
an eye out for

00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,200
another common example is gpl is not

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,200
compatible with

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:23,760
with the cddl the sun common

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,839
distribution and something licensed

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,960
because basically they're both copy left

00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,720
licenses that

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,240
that have different requirements and so

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,319
it's impossible to

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,280
combine them in the same work and comply

00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,280
with both licenses

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,160
uh gpl and compatibility or gbl version

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,079
two incompatibilities

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:48,319
um it's uh incompatible with

00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:50,079
um mozilla public license version 1.1

00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:52,480
um with the eclipse public license

00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,920
versions one and two and with the cddl

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,319
because they just have incompatible

00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:00,480
copyleft terms

00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:04,559
um the lgpl and gpl version

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,640
3 is incompatible with gpl version 2

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,599
again because of incompatible copyleft

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,079
terms um unless the gpl software

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,000
the gpl version 2 software includes an

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,760
or later designation like we discussed

00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,280
earlier

00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:22,400
apache2 yeah please

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,440
yeah i don't think it's compatibility

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,200
but if you've got a copyleft license um

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,960
within the transfer dependencies

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,200
and the author has chosen to put a

00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,559
permissive license on it

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,200
now i'm guessing that's not so much

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,680
permissive as a conflict

00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,720
was that is that a incompatibility in

00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,079
your mind

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:45,280
sorry uh say again so

00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:48,079
so so if an author has included

00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,720
code within their code which is copy

00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,480
left

00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,079
and then and then they choose to put a

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,880
permissive license

00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,559
on the parent products um then i'm

00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,680
presuming that obviously the copy left

00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,839
within that conspires into the full

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,359
product so that's right they can't they

00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,599
shouldn't they shouldn't be doing a

00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:08,640
permissive license it actually becomes

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,920
by default a a copy left

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,839
that's right so um if you if you have a

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,880
dependency that is copy left

00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,720
then you know that license requires that

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,119
you

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,240
make the entire combination available

00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,079
under

00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,359
um under terms that are compatible with

00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,760
it now

00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,839
it's it gets a little bit tricky right

00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,960
because

00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:37,200
um the gpl doesn't

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,880
the gpl does say you know the the

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,319
combination must be available under the

00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,799
terms of this license

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:47,680
now you can combine um

00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,160
you can combine permissive licensed code

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,680
with

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,880
gpl license code and

00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:57,680
you know and so long as um

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,319
the recipient has you know the right to

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,440
use

00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,200
the gpl code under the gpl and you're

01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,000
not attempting to sort of re-license

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,359
that

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,160
then um then

01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,280
really it's not it's not really a

01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,880
situation where

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,599
the gpl you know where the apache code

01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,160
is

01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,119
is re-licensed under the gpl you know

01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,520
they still exist

01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,960
under their own licenses it's just that

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,960
it's inc

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,880
it's incorrect to conclude that the

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,440
license for the entire package

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,040
is apache because you are essentially

01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,520
you're essentially representing

01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,480
two recipients yeah that the gpl

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,680
software is

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:40,079
yeah um

01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,760
okay and then uh the open ssl license is

01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,119
also considered to be incompatible with

01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,240
the gpl version 2

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,400
because of the weird it's it's a very

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,160
unusual license and it's got it's got a

01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,760
weird anti-copy left term

01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,799
in it that said open ssl was re-licensed

01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,920
under apache

01:00:54,799 --> 01:01:00,400
recently and so this is not

01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,000
uh well it's still incompatible with gpl

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,880
version 2 but it's not incompatible with

01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,240
gbl version 3.

01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,559
um so what changed from gpl version 2 to

01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,440
gpl version 3.

01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,160
um oh you know sorry we're we are out of

01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,160
time so

01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,839
i i want to give people the opportunity

01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,440
to sign off if they

01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:22,839
if they need to i apologize for not

01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:26,160
watching as carefully as i needed to

01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:27,680
um uh if if you all would like me to

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,799
continue with this i'm more than happy

01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,480
to

01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,160
i think i've got one i need to drop off

01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,720
but it's been really useful thanks very

01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,960
much

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:39,200
okay fantastic thanks for joining simon

01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,680
um all right so the differences between

01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,000
gpl version 3 and gpl version 2. gpl

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:47,040
version 3 added some new restrictions

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,960
um so you're not permitted to

01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,000
forbid a circumvention of digital rights

01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,760
management

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,760
that controls um that controls your work

01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,760
to the extent that it prevents

01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,920
uh recipients from exercising their

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,400
rights under the license

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,200
so you know practically what this means

01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,839
is

01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,920
you can't lock down your product in a

01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,960
way that prevents

01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,480
a recipient of the product from um

01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,039
from modifying and

01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,880
and reinstalling modified versions of

01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,079
gpl software

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,359
um so this becomes uh this is a

01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,880
particular concern

01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:32,400
in um in

01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,599
embedded devices um where you know

01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:39,039
the the producers of the devices

01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:42,799
um often like to basically encrypt

01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:45,599
the um encrypt the firmware

01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,160
to prevent any modifications to it um

01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,640
but

01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,680
gpl if you've got gplv3 software in

01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,599
there

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,880
the license says that the user needs to

01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,960
be able to

01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,920
uh needs to be permitted to circumvent

01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,480
drm

01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,039
and reinstall modified versions of the

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,599
of the gpl software

01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:08,160
uh relatedly gpl version 3 requires that

01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,160
producers of user products that contain

01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:13,520
gpl software and a user product is

01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:15,520
basically a consumer electronics product

01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,039
they're required to provide installation

01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,960
information for gpl

01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,440
software in other words they have to

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:25,520
provide information sufficient to

01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,760
allow a recipient of the product to

01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,280
install modified versions of the gpl

01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,880
software

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,640
so this was included by the free

01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,960
software foundation

01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,440
in in response to an increasing trend

01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,359
where device manufacturers were building

01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,359
linux-based devices were

01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,960
making it impossible for users to

01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,480
install

01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,720
their own versions of software on the

01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,480
devices

01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:52,000
um and i've got a typo here but you're

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,400
not permitted to

01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,280
limit the license of a target in a

01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,559
corporate acquisition

01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,400
and and you must provide them with

01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:05,760
source code so if you if you

01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,760
um uh if you

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,240
um if a company is transferred um in a

01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,440
corporate acquisition or a merger

01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:18,880
um and has licenses under open source

01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:21,520
under under gpl version three then

01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,480
the recipient or the purchaser of the

01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,520
company

01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:28,079
um receives those licenses and has a

01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,119
right to receive source code to

01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,119
the license software

01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,599
and then there are there are new terms

01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,680
in the gpl that are

01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,720
that are generally beneficial to

01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,440
corporate

01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:44,000
users um even though those three were

01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,880
you know raised a lot of concerns among

01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,520
among um you know corporate users of

01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,720
open source when when gplv3 was first

01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:56,480
released as i said it contains

01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:59,039
a specific exemption for providing

01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,039
copies privately to contractors to make

01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,400
modifications or to run the software for

01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,839
you

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,160
it allows you to so under gpl version 2

01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:11,520
there was arguably no

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:14,160
there was no way to comply with your

01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:17,119
source provision obligations by

01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,440
providing source code on the internet

01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,160
because gpl version 2 was written before

01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,720
the internet

01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,400
was really common and so you had to

01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,839
provide a copy

01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,880
um or offer to provide a copy to users

01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:32,799
um but gpl has has gmail version three

01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,720
has changed that and allows you to

01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,880
offer source code from the same location

01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:40,720
that you provide the

01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,920
object code gbl version 3 allows you to

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,160
include certain

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,760
additional terms that would arguably

01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,799
restrict be restrictions under the

01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,240
license

01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,760
that would be incompatible but so these

01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,319
these are things like you know

01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,200
reasonable um ip notices

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,240
or limitations of liability etc so

01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,760
you're allowed to add certain

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,359
supplemental terms that are compatible

01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,640
with section seven

01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:08,000
and um and then finally

01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:10,319
um gpl version three so both gpl version

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,240
two and gpl version three

01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,760
will terminate automatically if you

01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,280
violate the license

01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,680
gpl version three provides um for

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,559
automatic reinstatement of your license

01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,520
um if you

01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,280
come back into compliance within um

01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,680
within a certain period of time

01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,400
so that you know makes it easier to deal

01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,200
with

01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,079
uh to deal with violations uh once

01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,079
you've discovered them

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,440
um so just a few notes on gpl version

01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,000
three compatibility again

01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,960
look for gpl version two or later or gpl

01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,400
version two plus

01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,319
in the in the license of of gpl version

01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,000
2 software that you're using because you

01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:52,400
may well get a benefit from using the

01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,160
software under gpl version 3

01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,920
instead of gpl version 2. um gpl version

01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,400
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,520
again permits certain limited

01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,520
restrictions

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,920
it's compatible with apache version 2

01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,920
whereas gpl version 2 wasn't

01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,680
and it provides one-way compatibility

01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,760
with the afero gpl

01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,599
um meaning that even though they're they

01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,240
would otherwise be incompatible

01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:18,559
the gpl version 3 specifically lets you

01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,799
combine gpl version 3 software with a

01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:26,079
hdpl which has to be licensed under

01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:27,760
the affair license so that is the deep

01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,119
dive on copy left

01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,720
i hope that it has been um informative

01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,520
if not entertaining

01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,280
um and uh if you all have any questions

01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:43,450
you're welcome to ask them now or

01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:53,629
or um or to email me aaron finnis.org
