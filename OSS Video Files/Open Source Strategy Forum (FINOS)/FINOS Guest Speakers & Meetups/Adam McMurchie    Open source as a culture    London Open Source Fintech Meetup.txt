	00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,599
okay som good afternoon everyone I hope

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,290
that you can all understand my thick

00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,209
overly exaggerated Scottish accent and

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,879
today I'm gonna cover quite a bit of a

00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,230
broad range of topics actually I've kind

00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,010
of put a bit of a got you because I've

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,690
changed the theme last minute and we're

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,940
talking with James a what we've decided

00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,640
to do is I kind of thought we will cover

00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,980
ein and machine learning but I kind of

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,290
thought with this being the first

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,090
session I rather than me give you

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,699
something such as what are the latest

00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,859
frameworks what maybe the base makes

00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,890
best libraries and machine learning or

00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,559
were the best DevOps tools to use I'm

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,489
also going to take a bit of a risk and

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,129
hopefully this will have a bit of a

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,069
payoff but my plan is to give you a bit

00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:53,769
of a personal journey that I've had and

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:55,210
open source and the the aim is not for

00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:57,510
me to kind of come across and a

00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,010
showboating but my aim is to try and

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,559
have something that everybody here can

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:06,850
relate to or at least have some forms of

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,399
a synergies that you can also and feel

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,540
like basically yeah I could do that and

00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:14,229
I think that's what I'm gonna try and

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,729
get across today and so yeah so a little

00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,280
bit about me and a bit of a background

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,649
about me so I'm I'm the head of DevOps

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,649
in Barclays in the chief security office

00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:25,869
I also manage and head up the

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:29,340
environments team as well as well as the

00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:32,200
the run the banks or quite a heavy

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,170
repertoire there I also have a

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,789
background in physics and here's the

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,009
first bombshell which I want to try and

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,799
drop which is literally four years ago

00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:45,070
maybe and as a physics grad I knew

00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,479
nothing about coding so four years ago I

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,090
thought I knew something about coding I

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,640
had no idea before then I worked on the

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,219
chicken factory so and then before then

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,539
I was a bricklayer I'm now the head of

00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:57,310
their walks the head of infrastructure

00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:59,259
and a head of environments and I called

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,030
hands-on so I'm not just a talk liar and

00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,710
the point is I kind of want to get

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,479
across that we live in a different world

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:08,890
and that you can get there too so that's

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,539
the kind of the first theme that I want

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,000
to kind of open up on so I was very

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,550
fortunate and my very first rule in take

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,180
that I actually worked with mainframe

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,629
the veil

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,040
purrs db2 COBOL so the average age of

00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:26,859
the developers I worked with was about

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,569
55 and so it's really important that we

00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,000
appreciate the sort of world that we

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,680
live in so we don't code we don't

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,670
develop and we don't test in isolation

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,290
and what I mean by that is those

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:43,120
developers I worked with 2025 years ago

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,340
when they were developing code if they

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,840
made their code fail to compile three

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,329
times they'd be called in the back

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,189
office if it failed to compile in the

00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:54,730
fourth time you'd be fired

00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:56,230
and so you know we live in this world

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,540
where we say well you know I'm a

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,090
millennial or I don't have those

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,180
problems but why aren't things moving

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,010
fast why do people hoard codes why do we

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,010
live in a world where we still have

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,889
elitism and software development which

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,459
is now becoming fast the the main source

00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:17,950
of employment so the point I just want

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,919
to drive there is there's a reason for

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,530
that which is many of those people that

00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,930
are now in leadership come from a time

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,840
which was much much harder and they come

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,909
from a time where and it was much it was

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,769
more merciless in terms of your your

00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,900
development your your career in your

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,769
career progression and essentially your

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:44,319
contribution to the company so we so

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:48,689
what does Eisley mean then and does that

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,790
yeah that's not bad and so essentially

00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:55,659
when I when I first started coding about

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,879
five years ago the the story was IFM

00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,560
tech companies know they're not gonna

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,199
compete with us how can they compete

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,560
with us we they don't have the data then

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,169
about two two years afterwards the the

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,389
attitudes change - yeah yeah FM tech

00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,620
companies they can eat on the outside of

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,750
the cake so they can do things like

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,970
aggregating banking they can do all

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,739
these sort of software services but they

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,209
don't have a banking license and they

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,380
don't have the data and they don't have

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,000
the infrastructure so they can never

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,669
compete with us and now what the leaders

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,710
are saying in finance are

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,229
how can we cooperate more with intake

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,939
how can we how can we learn from FinTech

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:36,240
I think I'm moving fast how can we move

00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,189
fast like then I mean so it's not a

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,919
coincidence that the emergence of

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:43,469
Ventech the the progression of FinTech

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,360
the progression of AI and the

00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:47,759
progression of open source all happened

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,529
about the same time there it's it's no

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,300
coincidence and they are really it and

00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:54,060
and the point I can't want to drive

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,029
across there is it's clearly a culture

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,699
thing and more than as a technical

00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,610
foundation and so this can I talk about

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,279
github so for those again again my pet

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,500
shares to be more broad and rather than

00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,349
the level that we will talk to them some

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,599
and do this 40 million users and get up

00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:15,960
right now and the majority of those

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:17,969
users are in Africa so the majority of

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,120
the growth it's an Africa particularly

00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:22,469
Kenya and Ghana where they are focusing

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,479
on areas where they never had the

00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:26,339
capability before right so such as rent

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,169
and infrastructure I'm working on AI

00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:36,839
services and by far the biggest chunk of

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:40,020
all all activity on on open sources in

00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,930
is in Asia and not split between Korea

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,839
Japan and China and then Europe and

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,810
America seems to be the most referenced

00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,580
so we're about in the middle so the work

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,310
that we produced it's still the most

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,500
like the most retweeted the most share

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,069
than the most port and that is because

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:04,500
of this legacy standing on the shoulders

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:06,060
of giants so ok and many of you might be

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,189
sitting here saying like ok I don't care

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm a project manager I'm a PA so what

00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,729
does that have to do with me and I think

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,099
James had the point perfectly earlier

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,430
and you don't really need to code to be

00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:21,360
on github and he promised he read me

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,419
Peter's some ideas get there just to

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,729
join into the community because this is

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:29,969
growing rapidly and my most recent job

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,949
was my motions and dr. I got part of my

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,740
interview was a review of my github

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,990
profile why I do in my free time and it

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,260
was a job in the job I got before was

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,000
the same and the job that I got if

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,890
I was working in China was the same was

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,440
essentially a line-by-line in view of my

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,830
github and what did you do here why did

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,640
you do that

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:53,450
and so github really is the CV of today

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,910
and of tomorrow and it's about you go in

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,670
here but it's just to show that wine

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,530
Singh has gravitas so in terms of a

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,840
github and I'm in the top hundred

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,210
contributors in the world so I have

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,060
three thousand contributions this year

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,280
alone 165 repos you can think of that

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,250
projects and on average I come at about

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,350
five times a day these are the projects

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,850
I've worked on and I'll share the slides

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,380
after so that there's all the

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,970
information there that you can look at

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,530
and I'm not going to go into them all

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,390
but some of them have helped me

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,460
personally some of them have helped me

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,380
professionally and the point I want to

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,620
get across here is this is I said become

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,110
my life and I've met many of my friends

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:38,360
my career progression has happened

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:42,530
through my activity on github and so

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,160
okay and how did I get from and being a

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,650
bricklayer to working in tech and a few

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,620
steps I'm going to try and be as simple

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,840
as I can and why we do is I try to learn

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,210
something I'd be like oh how to build a

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,420
website so go on YouTube or look at a

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,520
blog and I've learned that no try it

00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,410
anymore it is a change something right

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,640
so a look at something that don't maybe

00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,220
in the beginning I wouldn't understand

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,400
what a variable was or in that a or idea

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,080
type so play about it with it and then

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,640
and then once I kind of got an idea from

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,040
change of things I just picked on github

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,600
and the minute I put on github it kind

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,220
of gave me a like a stale sense of

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,720
achievement because it's like yeah

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,950
that's my work there and that's online

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,650
then everybody can see that

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,420
and what you build up over time and and

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,070
then obviously the next thing you do is

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,750
you go on LinkedIn and you share that

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,460
and you pretend that you're next better

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,840
and then you go on Twitter and you also

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,780
share it and you retweet it you see look

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,849
what I've done I felt a you know a big

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,310
mass classifier which might be like

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,830
setting lines of code but then the great

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,010
thing about that is people are extremely

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,740
generous in my opinion on social media

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,030
people are quite the thrill but when it

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,590
comes to the work that you shared

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,720
they're generally quite generous

00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,700
as long as you don't possession and in a

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,440
sort of divisive way so if you go online

00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,630
and you say oh I've been working on this

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,090
thing enough I finally figured out how

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,160
to build a HelloWorld application or to

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,840
do a simple way about you'll find that

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,850
people will often share that a lot

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,260
they'll give you likes your family and

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,910
friends will share that and then and

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,160
then very quickly that will disseminate

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,930
enter the professional skier and there's

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,000
so many times I go to events where

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,480
people like oh you're a Don you've built

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,070
this and and so it has become a big part

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,490
of my life and it's a very simple

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,660
process that you can follow and then

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,930
obviously once you've kind of done that

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,240
and why I find doing is call up some

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,950
friends who can I want to get into

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
coding or whatever and see there's

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,450
meetup at Starbucks bring your laptop

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,370
and ok that's how you do a get commit or

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,170
here's how you you know you can't he's

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,670
to me he'll file then obviously get

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,100
progressively more complex

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,290
that's essentially what worked for me

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,110
and I think that might work for most

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:57,830
people

00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:00,980
I'm heavily against them and so again I

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,720
working with people who in my opinion of

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,090
people I respect the most mainframe

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,740
developers again they are now supposed

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,780
to retirement but they set the

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,290
foundation right mainframe put the man

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:14,390
on the moon mainframe has produced the

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,160
most successful economies in nation

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,770
states in the world so sure we're

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,140
developing and Java high spark Python

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,710
and the latest languages today but we

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,230
are still under penned by the shoulders

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,780
of the Giants and I think that that

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,990
culture still persists and heavily even

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,770
today I just think it's much more

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,720
beneficial I mean if we want our

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,880
companies to succeed we can have to be

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,950
more open about like our own abilities

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,260
and so for me personally you know one of

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,750
the things I needed in DevOps is I took

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,900
the you know to train our eleven women

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,670
and DevOps because it's the most under

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,670
underrepresented area and tech that you

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,360
find and it's no reflection on my

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,040
personality

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,560
again it's just beautifully to share

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,620
stuff for people and peninnah like a

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,760
starbucks meeting and just to prove it

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,120
where's my

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,600
and commit to github and it's only 30

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,340
years ago and I'm now in the top hundred

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,380
contributors but obviously it doesn't

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,110
stop there like you can get yourself out

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,660
there so I do I do videos and Chinese

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:23,540
and polish and English and everything

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:27,330
from AI to assembler but ultimately

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,690
everybody I think the truth of matters

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,580
is we're all human right so most people

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,560
only have about one or two good projects

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,870
and them right so there are a few people

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,330
that can plan out projects every week or

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:43,020
two but in reality that's not the truth

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,490
and most people there they're sort of

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,130
example if I was if I was to

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,630
unfortunately die tomorrow if people

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,150
look at my github they'd remember me

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,460
from one or two things not for ten or

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,520
twenty things it is really different for

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,950
organisations like Facebook because the

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,320
real have famous repository such as for

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,700
DreamWorks lipase and things like that

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:10,500
but for individuals such as yourself

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:14,010
you'll be known by one or two phase my

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,830
two flagship projects am two or three so

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,420
this is one thing I worked on

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:21,720
essentially I fell a bunch of bots into

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,760
our use a lot of sentiment analysis AI

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,790
to try and produce matrix to understand

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,720
what people are actually thinking and I

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,240
learned a lot

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,950
one thing I learned was and social media

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,470
is not a good barometer for public

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,360
opinion and I can produce I can at least

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,270
prove that statistically now although

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,370
it's not much of a shock collar is it

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:44,600
but I was a really big part of my life

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:46,890
and also a more collaborative

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,910
collaboratively so a close group of

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,320
friends and they're working on

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,180
technologies to help people in the

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,300
deafblind community who are the most

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,910
kind of I would say underserved and

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,130
community out there and the future one

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,550
but I'll try to plug to you guys later

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,100
this is team hunt so I'm picking up on

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,470
building on NASA's insight project to

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,980
basically rather than everybody shared

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,630
their CPU we all share our skills and

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,790
expertise to try and see if we can

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,760
answer some of the but

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,230
questions okay so that's all good and

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,630
sounds awesome

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,690
but there's a downside to it and so

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,490
Newark you have a lot of stats one of

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,490
the ones I haven't put here which is the

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,420
big one and 40% of all open source port

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:35,120
it's bad food and has malicious even

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,850
hands viruses or malicious code or some

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,160
form of a sloppy code which is full of

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,650
under abilities so you kind of have to

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,760
have your like sure when you're working

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,530
on your own you don't need to worry

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,540
about that the minute you want to put

00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,810
that out into the public we need to get

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,940
your security home and also open source

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,610
and this is no disrespect to see that I

00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:01,820
forgive him does anybody know who this

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:04,910
guy is and it hands up so sorry no

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,590
sociologists actually if you execute if

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,320
you did in any eye space you'll know him

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:13,430
anybody that is decent any I knew this

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,070
guy and he was my hero about five years

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,130
ago he can assure people that you don't

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:21,200
need to de grÃ¨ve and or you don't need a

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,360
background in gang coding

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,170
he produced some of the most amazing

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,910
work he's super famous and but we

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,860
started to wonder why is he purchasing

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,320
things on github so quickly and so fast

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,650
and at high quality he has it on YouTube

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,140
videos and he was recently found out

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,800
that all of his work was plagiarized

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,020
everything on github

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,390
it doesn't even stop there he actually

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,830
published papers which were plagiarized

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,880
from Google

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:52,490
nature articles and other bad companies

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,830
such as a deep mind and were peer

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,990
reviewed he made it into the scientific

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:01,540
community which shows you how shed they

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:04,100
are so he passed he passed all barriers

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,480
changed a few words and then seen when

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,570
github he was coming out and saying oh

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,140
here's my classifier oh here's my

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,790
Bitcoin stock prediction algorithm and

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,370
what he was doing is he was tweaking

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,770
people's hard work I'm just changing the

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,410
name and he got away with it for five

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,139
years he's recently confessed

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,360
and I personally forgive him I believe

00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:29,120
he has time to turn the leaf but the

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,829
point I want to get across is there

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,300
about actors out there and they will

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:36,470
capitalize on the work that you've done

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,750
and and there's no there is no there's

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,029
no complaints process and open source

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,920
the only way you can manage it is by the

00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,230
community the way that theological

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,389
managed with people a cost for like the

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,730
sky's a cheap and eventually there was

00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,750
enough pressure on him to force him to

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:57,230
come out to step back to pay back money

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,839
and that only happened by crowd by by

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,839
the suit by this I guess the the open

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,509
source community itself okay so I'm a

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,060
DevOps guy what I care about that so

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:10,699
here in or if you're in infrastructure

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,069
and environments you'll know how hard it

00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,689
is picking the right tool sets you know

00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:18,350
do you go for Enterprise to go for open

00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:20,660
source it's really really hard and the

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,360
way that used to be done about five

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,310
years ago was most companies would rely

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,279
on a rock star rock star would come in

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,170
and they would say you know this is the

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,970
tool that you pick but they will take

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,660
you on the direction that they want to

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,000
take you

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,310
that's the things that they know there

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,660
is nobody in this room that can claim

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,670
that they know everything here as an

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,470
expert I am in there I'm headed there

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,470
what I meant to know this stuff as an

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,420
expert I expect my guys notice but I

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,370
can't master a bit everything here and

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,050
this is just a small sliver of what's

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:56,630
actually out there so the need to be

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,490
honest and open is it's huge right so

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,259
just admit like okay I'm good at this

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,439
but I'm not really good at that now we

00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:05,150
we kind of move forward in the end piece

00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,220
I think the gentleman asked the question

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,079
earlier like what do you do if you know

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,679
massive data sets you can't put them on

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,990
github and that is my Pittman Cargill is

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,530
because cargo is awesome thanks so

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:22,760
hopefully it's a work in cargo you'll

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:26,809
get this is this is the open source for

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,250
AI developers and a male engineers you

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,539
get awesome competitions where you can

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,820
win a lot of money and the

00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:35,710
you you build your your your AI

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,529
algorithms you generate your own data

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:42,249
and you put it there and and so it's

00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:43,690
there for people to share and also the I

00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:46,239
guess the training just one thing I'll

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,830
quickly show you is the training here is

00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,309
really awesome so you could know nothing

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,769
about polling at all and he's young and

00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:55,960
start here and this will get you well

00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:57,879
and to look like by the time you finish

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,549
these courses you'll be submitting your

00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:05,070
own competitions and your own your own

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,070
data sets and

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:18,050
okay and then Kyle called us or people

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,790
like okay I'm not any I but I want to

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,040
learn how to use docker I want to learn

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,610
how to use github cannot recommend this

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,110
enough is absolutely amazing I'm not

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,920
going to but I'll just tell you what

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,960
white does it's actually they have so

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,700
much compute that you can just go

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,310
straight into a darker shell or into

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,680
cooper name in CL open chef it's got

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,150
stuff like learn an intensive rule from

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,790
scratch to learn and Jenkins from

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,250
scratch is a strongly they commend us

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,750
and it's what got me to where I am and

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,560
I'm gonna touch a little bit on genes

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:54,500
gene this point so okay so I talked a

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,570
lot of how I got where I am but I also

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,880
want to talk about what the future is

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,560
the future is like we're talking

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,780
different backgrounds here right when

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,400
somebody talks about AI with some of us

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,990
will go to sleep and somebody talks

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,300
about project management or testing

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,100
somebody goes to sleep the trick is you

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,900
have to marriage everything and some

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,910
literate program and we forward right

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,480
this one looks a bit boring well it's

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,880
Lena so Martin you're like you know

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,650
you're a physics worker and a small

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,780
industry and you're present in your new

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,390
your new algorithm to the business right

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,210
so maybe a professor he might be

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,540
interested in the formula they are the

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,670
engineers will be interested in and the

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,470
including leave read and then maybe the

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,660
business managers they actually just

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,200
want to see the waveform so it's really

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,820
you max images code and formulas in the

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,250
one page so that you can present to

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,600
everyone and this is Jupiter rubrics I

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,850
mean to some people this will be pretty

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,830
obvious stuff but the point is it's let

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,020
approved I mean it's clearly the way

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,700
forward as tech takes up more and more

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,350
of the job roles because you need to

00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:07,930
kind of communicate to everyone and I

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:10,220
think I'm okay right yeah sure why not

00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:14,450
I'll hae-jin to seven minutes and hope

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:17,150
for a few questions right okay so a yeah

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,450
this is the bombshell right so ii is the

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,790
buzzword obviously it's big one and when

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,980
I started in the my previous company

00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,620
when I was in China I remember talking

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,559
to the

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,140
a few and he was like oh get me some of

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,510
that yeah any ice create twenty twenty

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,980
twenty kilos fifty kilos of AI treating

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,920
it like it's some sort of product when

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,960
in fact the I may not be the optimal

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,270
solution for ML and noodle networks may

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,500
not be the optimal solution depending on

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,480
your business but let's just talk about

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,010
some stuff and contain while you before

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,650
ever exist these virginity by general

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,200
adversarial noodle networks that's what

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,150
you're dealing with now so imagine what

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,010
you're dealing with tomorrow and that

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,690
kind of blows my mind right like you go

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,210
in the home leg she looks a bit like

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,429
closing a part maybe well I mean these

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,559
people all don't exist and I was like I

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:09,270
think that was like three days of

00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,860
training so somebody left a computer

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:17,250
training for two three days to generate

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:20,190
that and so where I see the future of AI

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,960
is definitely in China smile tepee as a

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,929
service or just give it a quick example

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,000
or two and when I go at China I smile to

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,420
peak and does anybody know why you might

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,900
smile to pay any ideas and you should be

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,790
able to get up maybe anyone any ideas

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,590
the reason why I smell tepee is smiling

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,450
and it's not the things that you

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,309
normally do so when you walk into the

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,490
airport and you especially don't do it

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:47,640
in Scotland and but but generally a

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,770
smile is is new data right so when they

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,630
capture you smiling tepee that's new

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,750
generator that they can new data that

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,429
they can slice dice and remarket and so

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,690
China lead the way all the secrets they

00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,540
have more people enough so they have

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,790
more data but they're also just more

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:06,240
ahead and forward thinking and here's

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:09,030
another cool product you're you crash

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,620
your car on the motorway and you don't

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,550
know anything about cars so you don't

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,290
know if you're gonna get backed off by

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,630
the mechanic so you get out your phone

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,630
and the phone will say come closer

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,520
one wheel trim stand back and then what

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,950
the phone does is it generates a list of

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,720
damages using any I engine that's

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,330
running on the cloud and then it will

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,880
say to you right your your bells should

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,500
be 800 pounds and you can go to a

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,000
mechanic and the mechanic might say oh

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,610
it's two thousand pounds

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,400
you say well only says

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:40,309
here and it also is the uber of

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,840
mechanics because once you scan it and a

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,880
bunch of mechanics will come up and say

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,410
I'll keep that for you so you can just

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,650
click and pick a mechanic and they'll

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:50,420
they'll keep the trade for you so that's

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,920
another example of what a I is in China

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,160
and some other ones are things like

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,750
young ready contract generators so you

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,929
talk to your landlord with your phone

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,460
and a record and dictates what you're

00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:03,710
seeing and generally is a contract on

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,290
the fly it measures the honesty in your

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,390
voice and facial recognition so if you

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,510
say oh will you give me back the deposit

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,370
and the landlord goes yeah and they say

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,880
okay that's a lie and so you can

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:20,120
underwrite that any insurance which is

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:24,020
also part of the product and I'll wrap

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,000
up quite quickly but for me you know

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,340
we're all like regardless of your

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,260
position right most companies in London

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,419
will be considering and now at some sir

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,400
and there's a litt there's too much

00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,309
sighs I'm saying like five minutes over

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,679
four minutes please read the slides

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:42,020
afterwards I'll share them look at them

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,090
just get the basic idea of the sort of

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,280
pitfalls out there because there's a lot

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,280
there's fine there's far more pitfalls

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,950
than there are advantages and I guess

00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,130
one of these is if you do AI the wrong

00:23:51,950 --> 00:24:00,890
way and you can make your company go bus

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:02,480
intelligently yeah read those

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,200
unfortunately don't have that much time

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,530
to share I'm gonna kind of finish off on

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,679
well of maintenance that even even smart

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,900
systems are easy to fill right so like

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,820
my favorite one is human systems are

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,350
exploitable the intelligent ones are

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,380
even more exploitive all right so like

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,809
or is it a dog and then like obviously

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:27,380
apparently I win of course katakana if

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:30,890
you learnt the words right so so it is

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,900
kind of there's truth in in that this is

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,390
the final one and I just want to quickly

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,460
talk about it what I think so if you

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,230
don't listen to anything I say hopefully

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:44,950
there'll be six ones that you can maybe

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:47,710
one of them may be useful to you so I'm

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,780
who actually does Adele or strong hands

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,240
of be honest be honest like they

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,010
actually oh okay that's impressive and

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,970
does anybody do people use the stories

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:03,670
does anyone do the evil user stories oh

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:06,550
one person so so evils user stories is a

00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,350
great thing to do and you basically you

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,110
can't a story and you say how can i

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,900
sabotage this project like how could I

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,480
break it or like what be honest through

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,520
yourselves could that be a it story put

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,280
in the backlog only takes five minutes

00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,230
doing a Friday for fun and a user the

00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,610
evil user story generates far more

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,150
benefit than you might actually think

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,860
and Tahoe mission so if you got a

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,330
support team and you're good and

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,010
developers just put some buttons in

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,410
there so that rather than name get an

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,770
alert and see the servers down give them

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,800
the button to restart the server and

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:46,750
sure I'm not human feedback cycle and

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:49,030
governing to food and I think the way

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,850
forward is trying to find a system that

00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:55,000
combines both humans and automated

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,560
processes not Jenkins and there are

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,920
tools out there I Excel released

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,360
urbancode deploy and look into them the

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,150
cooldown is the okay this is like one

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,130
it's a good honesty um

00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:08,440
right the food honest imagine one day

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:11,080
every month where you can just be honest

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,480
and just say ah that foods got a bug in

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,880
it or I can that up and forgot to

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,770
pretend production and just have a day

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,470
where people can just flag stuff

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:23,410
anonymously and you see that inspect

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:26,290
that's broken that's gonna feel and then

00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,780
allow us to generate the the remediation

00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,080
and we don't want to you know it's not a

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:36,400
blame culture but and the best way to do

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,440
that is through food honestly I'll

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,230
finish off on the one last point which

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,920
is really close to my heart and has

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,650
anybody read the Phoenix project do

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,470
anybody remember Brent he remembers

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,600
Brent hey Brent was the guy that was

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,090
super intelligent brain was the guy that

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,690
on a Friday if you needed to deploy to

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,730
production

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,130
Scottie you need to remediate your

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,110
brands brands are where the biggest the

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,970
biggest technical debt and the biggest

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:08,000
rest to your organization especially

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,200
moving in our open source world if you

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,380
haven't made the Phoenix project I

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,390
strongly recommend that and yeah I'll

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:19,160
finish up on this note so software only

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:21,380
generated value and or and so I

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,030
appreciate this was really star show I

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,100
