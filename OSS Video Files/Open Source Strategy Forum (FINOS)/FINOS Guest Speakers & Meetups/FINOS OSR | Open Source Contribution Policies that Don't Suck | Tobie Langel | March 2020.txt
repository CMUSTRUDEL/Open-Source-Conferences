so my name is Aaron Williams and I'm the

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:24,630
head of the Open Source Initiative at

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,439
finis we run these meetings every two

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,779
weeks

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,660
on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. there's a

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,410
calendar invite and if you aren't

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,210
receiving it oh you're welcome to email

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,300
Aaron at canosa org if you'd like to be

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,989
added I'm pleased to introduce today's

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,710
speaker

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,050
Toby lonzell he is an open source

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,149
consultant with a consultancy called

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,829
open he works with with clients in a

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,430
number of industries including financial

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,500
services to help put together their open

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,219
source compliance programs and

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,140
understand how to better engage with

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,720
developers in the community and he's

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,369
going to talk to us today about open

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,299
source contribution policies that don't

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:15,750
suck in other words that are that our

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:18,780
developer friendly I think Toby I think

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,280
that's that's one way of looking at it I

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,540
do think there are other I mean you'll

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,490
see throughout the presentation but I

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,020
think the whole point is to get a you

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,820
know towards policies that are friendly

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,470
to everyone not only that you can do you

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,750
can have policies that benefit everyone

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:42,119
basically in the company great well

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,680
without further ado I'll let you take it

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,329
away and begin your presentation thanks

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,850
for joining you're full thank you so

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,180
much I hope hello everybody I hope

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,110
you're all doing fine display unusual

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,810
circumstances just a quick note before I

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,490
get started this talk was originally

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,509
given to a more sort of like tack

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:10,560
vertical so I'm aware that there are

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:13,090
policy in law differences between sort

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,730
of where financial vertical

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,590
Angell service protocol citizen and so

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,099
feel free to sort of like call me out

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,440
when you bump into when we're done by

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,870
two areas well you know you know the

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,450
situation is a bit different because I

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,650
think that would be a very enriching you

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,750
know for everyone to actually have a

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,790
conversation about this either during

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:45,459
that the presentation itself or at the

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:48,280
end of it so let's get started so you

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,840
know one of the first question that pops

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,180
up when you talk about open source

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,140
policies is whether you have one as a

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,269
company or not

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,340
so what I usually do when I give this

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,110
talk to a room of people I actually ask

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,120
people to raise their hands this is

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,980
gonna be a bit difficult your so we'll

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,220
just move ahead with the data points

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,610
that I have um and so what's interesting

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,269
as you know there's a survey that ran in

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:20,319
in 2018 on this topic and that asked

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,329
people tied to the Linux Foundation to

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,940
the group like the developers tied to

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,750
the next vanishing to the group about

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,480
whether they had open source policies in

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,359
their company or not and so you know if

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,400
you look at the data points it's kind of

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:39,450
concerning because turns out that close

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,169
to a half don't have one

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,450
about 40% only do and then 13 percent of

00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,819
respondents actually don't have any clue

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:54,130
as to whether they do have a new policy

00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:56,049
or not if you're digging into that data

00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,760
a little more you'll find out that the

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:02,829
smaller the company the less policy the

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,459
less opens was policies you'll find

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:12,280
there um and obviously the bigger the

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:14,370
company the more clarity there is we

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,739
know what's important to consider is

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,599
this was a survey ran by the Linux

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:25,690
Foundation for the tutor group which is

00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:26,910
a group that is a collection of people

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,470
that

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,800
part of open source programs at

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,270
companies so you know very savvy

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,610
technologies right and even in that kind

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,140
of audience you'll find you find that

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:47,030
there's a lot of you know a lot of lack

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:49,920
of clarity into how this is organized

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,910
and you know this begs the question what

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,230
does not having a policy actually mean

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,590
you know the belief is well if we don't

00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,200
have a policy we just don't have a

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,750
policy but in fact you you do have a

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,560
policy it's just like it's not written

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,320
it's implicit right it's not clear you

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,600
know I can quote I have a Miku here

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,670
which says like you have a policy

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,590
whether it is written down enough right

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,800
it could range from no open source at

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,530
all to anything goes but like if it's

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,780
not written that well you know you don't

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,580
really have it's no super it's not super

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:33,630
clear um and you know on the other hand

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,400
having a policy by itself doesn't mean

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,220
that you're really solving that problem

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,010
properly right so for example policy

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,610
could be extremely restrictive um and

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,570
prevent developers from actually

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,610
participating in the open source

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,130
projects that they need to even from

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,940
like their what they're actually hired

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,320
to work on um it could also be extremely

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,660
full of red tape you know and like

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,900
getting approval to participate could be

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,760
very long and complex um the processes

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,590
to obtain approval could be completely

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,990
opaque like you know it could be like a

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,330
black box so you ask can I join this

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,180
project and have a yes or no and have

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,880
absolutely no idea as to why it was

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,610
approved why it wasn't and and you know

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,380
no indication of what you could have

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,690
done differently if you can work on a

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,990
subset of the project and that would be

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,390
approved or not so basically you can

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,830
have you cannot have a policy written

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:34,350
down policy and you still having them an

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,800
implicit one or you can also have an

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,110
explicit written down policy that is

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,800
actually not really fulfilling

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:47,900
any of the goals that it should be so if

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,970
we sort of like um put these two

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,990
concepts restrictive and permissive on

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:57,780
an axis and implicit and explicit on the

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,500
other one we can start actually putting

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:04,530
companies you know or kind of companies

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,200
on in this graph and sort of figuring

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,230
out where people are and how they are

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,540
know how they're traveling where they're

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,970
going to as they grow was there much

00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,440
choice the immature so if you look for

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,400
example like small and medium

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:25,460
enterprises are going usually to be in

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,460
the implicit and rather premise of

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:33,150
warrant of this graph if you look at

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,460
startups startups tend to be a lot more

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,950
implicit about most things in general

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,840
and they tend to be less permissive

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,730
about open source than slightly bigger

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,130
companies because they're very much

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,080
product focused and so they don't really

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,820
want their developers or their engineers

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,860
to be focusing on anything but the

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,060
actual products that are building we

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,740
quickly from a business perspective

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:58,560
makes complete sense non tech enterprise

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:04,050
and this is sort of you know roughly

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,970
where the the the banking services

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,310
probably full sort of like in that

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,980
category although they're increasingly

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,040
more in the actual tech enterprise

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:17,640
category and so you find that in most of

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,670
the sector it's rather restrictive but

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,550
it's also not super well spelled out so

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,710
it's kind of implicit all the tech

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,780
companies which is probably where you'll

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,180
find most financial services right now -

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,280
or in the restrictive category and

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,260
they're quite explicit about it right if

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,620
you think about uh you know companies

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,460
like you know even Microsoft like a over

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,020
a decade ago saying that you know Linux

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,940
was a cancer it's kind of like super

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,860
explicit about how they perceive

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:52,930
open-source in general they perceived so

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,420
you know if you had a patent troll right

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,750
and in the mapped in that in that graph

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,540
it would be whilst highly highly

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,000
explicit right of course because it

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:08,649
would be super protective of the IP it's

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:18,390
trying to actually leverage tech

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:21,060
companies on there's someone that's not

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:27,190
from a calling user you can get yourself

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:29,529
great thank you so much um

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,709
so tech companies tend to be more

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:36,310
permissive on you know more on the

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:38,290
premise of an explicit side and of

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,950
course you'll find trendsetters here

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,180
that are super explicit super permissive

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:48,610
you know thinking for example of a

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:51,240
company like github right so what's

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:55,209
interesting is to look the kind of like

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,320
transition companies do as they grow oh

00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,089
as they go through digital

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,940
transformation so let's have a look at

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,339
what would happen to a start-up that

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,360
grows into more of a larger company

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:10,959
right as the startup grows um it's going

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,839
to you know become more explicit about

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,000
rules right and it's also going to

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,910
become more permissive about its open

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,430
source approach as new developers join

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,620
the company that are less necessarily

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,529
focused on you know the original product

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,029
but maybe building infrastructure for

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:34,000
the company what's interesting is

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,770
there's a point of inflection where that

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,640
startup is gonna hire its first IP

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:43,360
counsel or maybe get a Qui acquired and

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:47,560
maybe go through funding round where the

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,290
VCS will be more you know looking at

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,950
more finally at like the software and

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,570
the licensing around it and what usually

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,550
tends to happen right at the inflection

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,940
point is you have an IP Council that

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:04,000
comes in and so woo suddenly as the

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,980
company grows everything becomes a lot

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,090
more explicit right

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,200
everything becomes a lot more

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,930
restrictive and that usually can be like

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,580
a real problem for the company if it

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,980
needs to have an effective over source

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,220
presence so what you'd like to see

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:25,210
instead of that is the company becoming

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,730
more more explicit obviously but keeping

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,690
the same level of permissiveness or even

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,510
increasing it now if you look at an old

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:38,230
tech company um you know like for

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,780
example Microsoft um when it was sort of

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:45,430
like very restrictive on the tendency is

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:48,190
for those to become more permissive as

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,920
they sort of understand and figure out

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:55,060
the value of having a strong open-source

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:58,300
culture finally if you look at the none

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,900
at I can to pry sector the tendency

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,410
there is to be just more explicit about

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,260
this

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:08,410
whereas what you'd like to see instead

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,690
right is them to be both the more

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,450
explicit but also become more

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,120
progressive because of the value that

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,810
they can get out of being more involved

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,000
in the open-source culture and the you

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,450
know building open-source projects and

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,200
all of the benefits that you get from

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,340
participating and basically where

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,110
innovation happens in so you know all of

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,140
that to say that the area that you

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:40,660
really want to go towards is one that's

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:44,100
both explicit and as permissive as you

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:48,130
can make it

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,470
so let's now sort of dive into you know

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,600
what makes a policy that doesn't suck

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,520
and for that we'll look at the

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,990
perspective of the different

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,120
stakeholders of an open-source

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,550
contribution policy right

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,570
so from an engineering perspective um

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:07,750
what you see is that a good policy is

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,900
one that is permissive right so you know

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:14,230
it allows open-source contribution to be

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,530
part of the organization's engineering

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,890
culture and best practices and it's

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:24,250
based on trust and on

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,920
Engineers know what open-source projects

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,040
they should be involved with to help

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,730
with surprise that they're building

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,070
secondly um such a policy is explicit

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,740
the decision-making processes

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,680
well-documented and transparent right

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:46,330
you want to know um when you're you know

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,480
your IP council rejects an engineering

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,760
organization of engineering org to

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,130
participate on a different on a specific

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,970
project you want to understand why and

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,140
you want to sort of be able to you know

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,520
eventually even escalate the

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,650
conversation around this to weigh the

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,890
cost and benefit of being involved with

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:11,200
that kind of was that particular project

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:16,390
thirdly you want the policy to be

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:19,650
informative right if you cannot use you

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,870
know a GPL because you're building

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,910
software as a service well instead of

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,550
just saying no you cannot use the

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,520
software actually educating the

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:35,830
engineers on the reason for not being

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:38,290
able to use a GPL it's gonna clarify to

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,030
them why and they will not be asking all

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,940
the time and it won't help them you know

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,290
potentially find you know have that as a

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,750
criteria when they're looking for

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,780
projects that they can rely on to bone

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,380
the software that they're building and

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:56,710
lastly the critical aspect is it has to

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,320
be as frictionless as possible right the

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:03,040
worst kind of policies and those where

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,020
engineers exchanged emails was the legal

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,880
department for a week before getting an

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:11,500
approval or you know a rejection over

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,610
email right that doesn't make any sense

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,260
you want to be you want to minimize the

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,600
kind of interactions you want to make it

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,890
as fast as possible and as clear as

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,830
possible now if you look that from the

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:29,560
perspective of you know the legal

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,790
department instead of a company and you

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,720
know here I just want to clarify that

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,459
I'm not a lawyer so if you have

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,589
things that you want to add here if you

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,240
have a legal background or if you have

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,560
such a role in the company or if this is

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,319
different in the financial industry a

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,319
great time to raise your hand and talk

00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:50,480
about it but basically in general the

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,810
role of legal and the company is we

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,560
don't like to minimize risk right and a

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:59,629
few things that they will focus on is

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,199
avoiding to you know give away

00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:05,660
competitive advantage protecting IP I

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,850
can use that can be used defensively or

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,709
you know sometimes even offensively

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,620
um this is very common for example

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:14,720
around tech companies and also want to

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,569
avoid so sort of like things related to

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,750
reputation on damages and accidental

00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:23,410
infringement right and that includes you

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:27,129
know compliance

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,079
another thing that legal won't want is

00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:32,899
processes that are consistently funneled

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,610
across the company right the worst kind

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,100
of situation from the legal departments

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,769
perspective is when they have a set of

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,870
policies and then they find out like a

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:45,230
whole bunch of organizations or like you

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,970
know not following them or aren't aware

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,129
of those policies we're doing things

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,990
completely differently or just

00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:53,329
contributing to open source on their own

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,790
time without asking so you know this

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:59,000
plenty of like ways this can go wrong

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,529
and so one important aspect from famila

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,389
you know legal departments perspective

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,880
is consistently for you know

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:12,169
consistently consistency across the

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:16,730
company the other aspect is from a legal

00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:19,039
perspective legal wants to be savvy

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:23,000
about what gets written down and what

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:30,260
doesn't right in the US for example you

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,539
have the triple damage caused around you

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,419
know when you when you use a patent to

00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:38,630
knowingly right so you want to make sure

00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:43,940
for example that engineers are not

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,500
looking at patents to find out whether

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,140
they can use something enough

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,890
but so you know depending on the cases

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,260
you have times when you want a paper

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:59,030
trail and times where you really don't

00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:01,039
from a legal perspective and then the

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,919
last thing which I think is important in

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,840
which I think a a really strong open

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,289
source contribution policy can help was

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,580
as you don't want the legal department

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:17,799
to be drowning in a sea of like menial

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,789
issues and missing out on the key

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:23,059
licenses that they should have had to

00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:25,990
look at right for example if you know

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:29,990
you know you're building again a

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,750
software-as-a-service product and you

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,870
have a hundred and fifty open source

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,169
projects they used to build it 149 of

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:43,549
which at MIT everything's fine you don't

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:45,830
want to miss the one that is a critical

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:49,070
piece of the whole thing which has an a

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,870
GPL license right so you know that's the

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,049
kind of thing that if you have a good

00:18:50,870 --> 00:19:02,950
policy I'm like clear systems you'll

00:18:54,049 --> 00:19:02,950
have a better chance of avoiding finally

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,200
the business perspective so move from

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,299
like an executive level um what exactly

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:26,270
a looking for while you're looking for

00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:35,720
engineering to be happy themselves

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:39,020
because I think it's Brent who's who has

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:44,150
the can the host actually you everybody

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:46,100
and an unmute Toby unfortunately there

00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:53,679
is a there was a mix up of the host

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:53,679
functions but I think thank you folks

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,059
so yes so from an executive perspective

00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:00,409
from the business perspective what you

00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:03,169
what is engineering to be happy and

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:05,870
productive right you also want resks to

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:08,360
be minimized anyone understood you want

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,710
a strong and and you know good

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,749
communication between legal and

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,669
engineering so everyone's happy and

00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:17,450
everyone's able to talk to one another

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:20,120
and you know find solutions to common

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,429
problems um obviously you want an

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,399
alignment between the decisions that are

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,669
made and your business goals right so if

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,980
a project um you know if it would be

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,619
great from an engineering perspective to

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,879
be able to contribute to a project but

00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:43,759
there was you know litigation happening

00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:46,100
at the same time was a huge contributor

00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,440
to that project maybe now's not the

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,070
right time to actually be investing in

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,379
that project

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,600
so you want you know good communication

00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:57,919
about this an indictment and Trust on

00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:01,009
all sides and you know one of the things

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,909
that makes of this conversation sort of

00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:07,580
difficult is that there is a very

00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:09,889
different way of seeing the world

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,039
um so I'm painting those broad strokes

00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:14,659
here right but like there is a different

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,269
culture and a different way of seeing

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:19,639
the world between legal and engineering

00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:22,490
and in a company right so for example

00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,559
legal really wants to minimize risk and

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,200
then the other hand engineering will

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,820
want to maximize velocity right so the

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,700
engineering what I want to go as quickly

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:36,529
as they can and legal want to go as

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,309
slowly as possible to avoid axes if you

00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:42,409
look at communication preference um

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:44,360
lawyers are often concerned about paper

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,129
trails and so they will prefer to

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,850
actually have meetings where they speak

00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:51,049
to other people and on the other hand

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,179
engineers what they really want is

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,929
asynchronous communication that is done

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:58,009
in Britain

00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:59,509
so again conflict I don't know if you're

00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:01,580
familiar with the concepts of managers

00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:04,519
schedule versus makers schedule but

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:09,889
basically engineering requires long

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:12,440
blocks of time to work on things and on

00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:14,360
the other and on the other hand

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,670
sort of you know the legal profession is

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,500
extremely used to working in like really

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,730
small increments making calls going to

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
meetings it's more of a manager's

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:25,130
schedule so here again

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:28,550
attention engineering is really a lot

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,070
about binary thinking illegal is all

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,480
about the you know the gray in between

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,580
the black and the white

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:40,730
so you know really spectrum thing and

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,350
you know by nature again legal and the

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,420
company has a conservative role

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:49,640
whereas engineering has an innovative

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:51,980
role so coming to agreement between

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,480
these two sides requires first of all

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,410
acknowledging that this tension is

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,560
normal right

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,240
it's checks and balances in journeying

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,170
Engineering is there to push things

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,640
forward and Legolas is able to say whoa

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,440
gently let's let's let's be careful

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,060
about this it's considered that let's

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,930
make sure that we're you know not

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:14,300
exposing the company to legal and you

00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,190
know as an executive was someone like

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,730
you know an open source programs office

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,370
a strength to make progress here what

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,430
you wanting to know to do is listen to

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:28,670
both sides right and remind them that

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:32,560
like both of their roles are needed to

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:35,930
achieve to achieve success and to make

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,260
common business goals right um and so

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,240
legals role is to minimize risk but it

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,390
cannot do that at the expense of

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,090
innovation and on the other hand

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,760
engineering needs cannot be fulfilled at

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,140
the expense of the company's survival if

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
they come you know if engineering is

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,280
asking for things that don't make sense

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,230
or that are putting the whole company in

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,590
jeopardy then that doesn't make sense

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:04,880
right so you want to find common grounds

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,530
and a good policy will help find common

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,470
ground and will actually help improve

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:13,490
the quality of life and the stress

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:15,500
levels both sides right um and of course

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,990
I mean you know I've talked that like a

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,610
plenty in other other talks but you want

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,910
to align your open-source activity with

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,320
your business goals and you have to have

00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,900
everyone understand that if you're a

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,090
parent control

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,390
don't do open-source right if your

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,270
business relies on having a really

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,220
strong open-source presence um if you

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,580
absolutely need to attract the best

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:44,380
engineers do invest in open-source and

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:46,180
sort of like you know tuned down except

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,290
the increased risk on the legal side

00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,310
basic

00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:53,410
and then lastly except that an

00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:56,830
open-source policy is something that was

00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,050
going to change um was time and change

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:04,990
was how your business is structured and

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:06,520
how it evolves so let's dig into the

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,120
specific aspects of an open-source

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,640
policy an open-source policy has

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,580
basically two points if you go in at the

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,590
high level one is using open source and

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:22,060
the other one is contributing back to

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:24,850
open source and so if you look at using

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:31,450
open source that that's a really well

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:35,560
understood problem we've been we've been

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:38,560
using open source as basically

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,900
industries and you know for like close

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,730
to well you know close to two decades at

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:48,820
this point um and so you know the main

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:51,820
issues around around using open source

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,850
from the outside is essentially one of

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,160
compliance right and then one of like is

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,120
the software that you're using

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,520
compatible with your current and future

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,940
business models it's sort of like the

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,160
two key aspects and as this is mostly

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,950
and well honest a problem and a problem

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,260
in which there's a lot of players that

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,970
are you know offering really solid

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,850
compliance solutions at this point I

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,550
don't want to dwell on it too long and I

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,680
really want to focus instead on the

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,050
contributing to open source aspects

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,180
because I think and I've talked about

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:33,670
this again in the past like notably in

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:37,600
indem and the New York open source in

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:39,399
the fall about you know the benefits of

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,440
contributing to open source

00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:43,779
versus using open Swiss which now

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,119
everyone is doing so there's you know

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:48,009
there's no huge competitive advantage of

00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,979
using open-source because everyone's

00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:52,509
doing it obviously you should but this

00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:53,909
is not gonna give you an edge whereas

00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:56,679
building a stronger open-source

00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:59,649
contribution culture um I can actually

00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,019
give you an edge so if we look at

00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:03,879
contributing to open source the first

00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:05,529
thing that happens is obviously

00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:11,200
engineers can contribute to open source

00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:13,479
at work and outside of work and we

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,999
should first talk about contributing

00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:21,539
outside of work because this is

00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:25,089
something that comes up very often so

00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,070
one of the questions that comes up often

00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:30,969
as kane employees contribute to open

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:34,149
source on their own free time right and

00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:35,859
you know if you ask if you ask this

00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:38,559
question so this is again this is where

00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:43,029
I usually do you know ask that the

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,369
audience you know yes can you contribute

00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:48,099
without asking for permission

00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:51,219
yes but must ask for permission so that

00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:53,919
sometimes means no right um I don't know

00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:57,789
and no right so these are like to form

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,409
sort of questions and if you know

00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:03,129
there's that's been asked to the

00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:05,320
industry you know let's dig into the

00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:07,839
data that I have so the question was how

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,820
does your employers IP agreement policy

00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:14,289
affect your free time contributions to

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,119
open-source unrelated to your work so if

00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:21,999
you look at the data that's from the

00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:23,729
github open source survey in 2017 47%

00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:26,019
said yes we can I can absolutely

00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:28,049
contribute to open source in my free

00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:28,049
time

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:38,259
half percent had to ask right and 37%

00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:40,629
had no idea just didn't know whether it

00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:43,809
was okay or not so I find that really

00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:46,089
concerning but if you look at like where

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,460
that sample data actually where that

00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:51,549
data actually comes from and gets really

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,230
scary because on that date the

00:28:51,549 --> 00:29:00,490
respondents were sampled

00:28:53,230 --> 00:29:06,400
randomly from open source repositories

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:10,620
on github right so this is you know 40%

00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,630
of people that are actively using or

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:18,880
contributing to open source software on

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:21,760
github in 2017 right did not know

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,880
whether we're actually allowed to do so

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,580
or not right so I find that really

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,590
really concerning and so that's one

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:34,830
reason why it's really important to have

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,830
super good and super clear IP policy

00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,549
engineers because it kind of fires that

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:43,330
problem which basically becomes a

00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:45,190
liability for everyone so why is there

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,840
so much confusion about this well the

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,640
thing is there's a number of reasons

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,510
first of all it depends on the

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,240
jurisdiction right so in some countries

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,669
or you know even in some states in some

00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,150
countries um it's not uncommon for

00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:04,110
example in the USA to have on the

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:08,380
employer own the IP produced by an

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:12,630
employee 24/7 regardless of the topic on

00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:14,650
which that you know that IP is right

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,200
sometimes like in for example in

00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:21,900
California you have extra criteria that

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,370
apply right so you have for example

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,960
whenever you're using company equipment

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:31,390
even if it's outside of work right the

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,450
IP belongs to the employer and when you

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:38,049
think about the fact that you have a lot

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,080
like the actual time that you spend

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:44,490
building a developing development

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,630
environment on the fact that every

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,940
engineer is now have you know and now

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,730
has a laptop that they bring it home you

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,030
can bet that a ton of open source that

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,160
is actually not built in it that it's

00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,770
not related to work is actually built on

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,350
company equipment and so you know that

00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:05,919
creates a whole again the whole bunch of

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,559
liabilities and misunderstandings and in

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,019
some time

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,249
very painful outcomes for everybody

00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:15,350
right and so the problem of this

00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:16,700
confusion is that often prevents

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,610
employees from contributing to open

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,499
source if their service um or it

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,899
actually creates a situation where

00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:29,029
employees contribute to open source even

00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:30,950
though they're not really supposed to so

00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:33,769
you know one of the common solution for

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,499
this is well employees have to just ask

00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:38,600
for permission before being able to

00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:40,789
contribute on their on their own time

00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,509
right so a lot of companies have a

00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:47,749
process for this um and it tends to be

00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:50,450
focused on employees releasing their own

00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:55,100
open source projects rather than

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:58,820
contributing to existing projects and it

00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,529
also relies on having a set of pre

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,610
approved projects that you are working

00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:06,019
on and this whole thing completely

00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,240
breaks down when you're talking about

00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:10,519
for example um you know languages was

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,240
super high number of dependencies like

00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,220
JavaScript and node.js project because

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,809
you basically you know if you have like

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,720
a thousand or you know 1500 modules as

00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:25,369
dependencies in in a project that you're

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,470
working on then you have to stop fixing

00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:30,289
bugs in there you're basically spending

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:32,539
your time writing emails to legal to get

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:35,749
approval to work on like you know to do

00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:38,600
a one-line change in a random JavaScript

00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:41,779
module so it's like you know that really

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,639
doesn't work out very well so there's a

00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,919
really interesting solution here that

00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:47,690
was built by github that was designed by

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,240
Delta github a number of years ago which

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,279
is called PayPal which is balance

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,429
employing agreement which I encourage

00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:58,759
you to go have a look at and it's based

00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:01,190
on github own IP agreement and it

00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:04,070
basically only claims control of

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,009
creations made for or relating to the

00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:11,539
company's business so it's it's really

00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:13,460
focused on um you know what is what an

00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:15,980
engineer is hired to be working on and

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:19,129
it lets basically engineers work on

00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,390
other things uh without you know without

00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,520
claiming the IP

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,590
so that basically makes everyone's life

00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,270
a lot easier if it's impossible to

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,380
implement in your company it's a great

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:32,510
option so now that we've talked about

00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,150
contributing outside of work

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:39,920
let's get to contributing inside of

00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:43,760
right at work and so here you have

00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,770
basically two big areas one is when

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,110
you're releasing a new software you've

00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,870
built inside of the company and the

00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,240
other one is when you're fixing or

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:56,630
software that you're relying on or that

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,030
you're participating to as a company but

00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:02,140
then it's not you don't own the whole IP

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:06,700
originally you're not releasing some

00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:11,109
let's look at releasing software first a

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,109
couple of things that you can do here is

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:21,800
to make it easier form sort of like

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:25,929
streamline common cases where there's

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,240
like very little legal risk for example

00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,490
google has a smaller than a hundred

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,230
lines of code rule well at least it did

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:36,500
a couple of years ago probably still

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:40,240
does um and the idea here is it is very

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,980
common that you want to for example

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,570
releases him you know a bit of code to

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:52,250
demonstrate how for example an API that

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:54,190
you've built right so you have this API

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,260
it may be that you're selling or maybe

00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,940
you know two as an interface your

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,570
services for your clients or something

00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:04,940
like that and you know you're the team

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:07,970
that's in charge of documentation wants

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,859
to write like a small app to showcase

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,890
how to use that API would just even exam

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:16,910
an example in life right and they want

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:19,580
to release that under um and an open

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,859
source license so that your clients

00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:24,170
actually allowed to use it who is that

00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:26,240
having to go through like a complex

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,480
process of obtaining you know an

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,859
agreement for them to do so right so

00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,420
Google has this great rule for this

00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:32,970
which is to say well basically if what

00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,250
what you

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,170
is more than 100 lines of code we're

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:40,470
pretty confident it's not gonna make any

00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,480
essential IP of ours and so you can just

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:47,099
go ahead and open-source it you don't

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,460
need to request special permission so

00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,650
that's a really good sort of like way to

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:55,590
basically handle a bunch of cases that

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,990
would use up a lot of resources of legal

00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:00,359
resources to approve and where you're

00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,880
actually not protecting much by having

00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:06,570
you know by having like a more stringent

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,240
requirements amendments the second thing

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,099
that you want to do is you want to offer

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,010
well-oiled and well documented processes

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:18,470
checklist templates and everything to

00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:21,859
make it as easy as possible for your

00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:24,420
engineers to release software right

00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:29,400
you'll find them a number of really good

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,980
resources on the policies um

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,430
represent or of the to the group which I

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,530
encourage you to go check out thirdly as

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,410
an open source programs office what you

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:43,470
want to do is offer help right just be

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:45,119
available make yourself available make

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,220
it clear how you know if you have office

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,990
hours with that kind of stuff so that

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:54,660
engineers can actually reach out and ask

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:56,609
questions and so I know that this sorry

00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,080
I know that this last example this last

00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:59,940
point is probably going to be more

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,589
difficult in the financial system than

00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:06,869
elsewhere but one of the things that you

00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:09,270
that is great as if you can actually

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:12,810
promote working in the open from the

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:16,109
start rather than releasing software

00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,970
once it's done um to build a community

00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,550
around software like the earlier you

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:23,220
release the software um the more

00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,530
ownership contributors external

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,030
contributors feel that they have and the

00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,250
morning we'll get involved so from an

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,700
you know billing community perspective

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,859
it is much better it's also a lot easier

00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:37,200
to release software when all you have is

00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:40,080
a readme file then when you actually

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,150
have to go through you know commit

00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,000
history to make sure that you have I

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,790
accidentally put some keys you know like

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,770
private keys

00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:50,910
there they're not like copyrighted

00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:53,170
images there are not comments that

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,720
shouldn't be yes you know there

00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,660
shouldn't be public there's no like you

00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,820
know client data there was like them you

00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,820
know if the whole process has been in

00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:07,570
the open um there is no sort of like

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,670
risk of like this big you know jumping

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:13,810
the cliff kind of moment moving from

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:16,990
close to open and one interesting thing

00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:20,350
here is when the concept that's called

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:23,530
you read me driven development which is

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:26,710
a concept where basically you start by

00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:28,420
writing the readme so that you know the

00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,450
explainer of the software that you're

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:35,410
gonna be building so that you clarify

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:39,520
scope write legal can approve the readme

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:42,100
and then engineering builds the software

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,920
around the readme and if they want to

00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:48,090
increase the scope that's when they go

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,090
back to legal to have a conversation

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:57,220
lastly let's quickly look at patching so

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,590
patching as you know by far the most

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:05,700
common activity and the most important

00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:05,700
one in the day of an engineer working

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:17,510
[Music]

00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,000
you're basically spending a lot of your

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,070
time fixing small issues come in there

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,190
and open source software that doesn't

00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,630
belong to you or your company so the

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,090
experience here must be as frictionless

00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,980
as possible for engineers because if

00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,870
every time you have to fix a one-line

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,730
and module it takes like three days to

00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:43,510
get approval it's basically impossible

00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:45,700
for them to do that and what happens is

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,640
if they cannot do it at work they will

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:51,730
literally take it home and do it on

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,150
their own time and that has similar IP

00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,970
consequences for the company you know

00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,450
legal starts to no longer be aware of

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,329
what

00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:04,000
going on and you know this is something

00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:07,180
that happens very commonly I've I've

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,839
actually had you know engineers come up

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,609
to me at open source conferences working

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:14,890
in the banking industry and telling me

00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,570
that we're taking you know they were

00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:19,000
doing work in the evening that they

00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,790
needed during the day because they you

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,290
know the policies at their company

00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,970
prevented them from doing that work

00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,320
during the day and so they were just

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,109
doing it on their own time

00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,060
so you know you can look at it from the

00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:33,880
perspective of well it's great you know

00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,800
our employees are working at night and

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,510
we don't have to pay them but the other

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,220
way you can look at that is well that's

00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,990
kind of a really broken system these

00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,910
employees are super interested to go

00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,619
work for someone else I mean there

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,089
weren't like no really keen to hear if

00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:50,980
there were like interesting options

00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:53,800
elsewhere and um you know they're also

00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,140
this is this creates a huge risk from a

00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,630
legal perspective because legal no

00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:09,579
longer knows who's involved was what

00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:12,220
project so the idea here is to make the

00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:14,890
process as easy as simple for engineers

00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:19,480
and trust that they will do the right

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:23,500
make the right decisions and you know

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,760
ask and reach out for difficult cases so

00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,990
obviously you want to bounce this

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,420
depending on like how your business but

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,420
make it as frictionless as possible and

00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:39,000
then the last part is cash those

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:43,030
decisions right if if you've approved

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,920
people contributing to node well just

00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,079
like do it once and then you know make

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,270
it really easy may have a you know at

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:52,960
least have a list of projects of github

00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:58,390
repositories listed that you allow

00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:02,430
engineers to contribute to um so you

00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:04,810
know back again we talked about

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,510
contribution you know open source

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,950
contributions and policies we didn't

00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,780
really dig into the using open source

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,040
point because that's really essentially

00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,670
around compliance it's a one

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,010
problem and we looked at basically

00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:21,220
contributing to open source we split

00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:23,410
that up between outside of work and at

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:29,080
work and at work we split up between

00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:32,200
releasing software and patching self in

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,480
before I open up for questions I quickly

00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,230
want to talk about last thing that

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,790
seeing be extremely effective is

00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:42,970
actually once you have a strong policy

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:47,980
you can make up much better by turning

00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:50,890
it into an app or service wait you know

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:54,580
how this works is basically you know the

00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:58,360
caching of what we're talking about you

00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:01,090
can you can cache you answers um you can

00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,250
automatically approve a number of

00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,630
requests at pre-established requirements

00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,710
and guidelines for example um you know

00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,560
that's just an example right you could

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:14,080
approve patching any MIT license

00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,640
open-source project that's on github you

00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,650
could even say something like well you

00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,260
know if it has a gettin mighty license

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:23,260
when apache license and it does not

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,530
belong to these three companies that

00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,670
were currently having a hard time was go

00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:32,500
ahead do it right um it can also

00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,320
automatically reject requests that don't

00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,700
meet your criteria at all for example

00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,700
again you're building a certain you're

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,270
building software as a service oh it's a

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,190
GPL you just don't touch it right so you

00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:49,570
know make that part of like this

00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:52,680
automated automated you know system that

00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:57,130
you can use um and this can actually

00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,770
remove a lot of the cases and then

00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:05,440
basically any case that doesn't fit oh

00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,850
you know pre-approved cached or that you

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,830
automatically mean that you know that

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,650
you're gonna reject you can manually

00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:15,160
handle in cash as you make decisions

00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,990
around those manual questions right um

00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,090
and you know the benefit of that

00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:21,610
obviously is that the legal team gets to

00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:25,840
focus on the hard cases and not the

00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:28,150
common ones what's really interesting is

00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,070
Adobe actually you know I advised

00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:33,160
informally actually advised that the

00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,670
Adobe's Ospital on this now about two

00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:41,080
years ago and when they implemented such

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,910
a system what this gave them as you know

00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,300
open-source reviews you used to take

00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:48,250
four point six days and they were

00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,380
actually able to turn it into four point

00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,600
six hours right so every time there was

00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,400
a request before it took it it took

00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,740
basically a week and suddenly it was

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,420
half a day but the best part that's

00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,690
actually not on that slide and should be

00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,650
is that um really quickly I think the

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:08,110
data was close to ninety five percent of

00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:10,720
requests just basically were answered by

00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:13,600
that app itself it was like pre cached

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,580
data oh it was like licenses that were

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,870
pre-approved or was projects to a

00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:25,480
preview so you know that was a huge

00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:27,670
boost for just productivity for

00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,120
continuing and also for the Lee on the

00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:34,840
part and there's you know you actually

00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:37,090
get a lot more benefit from turning your

00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,010
policies into services like this because

00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,160
you can start collecting data right you

00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:44,230
can start understanding well we know

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,610
what projects do we open source but do

00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,960
we actually know what projects we're

00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,790
relying on and what projects we

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,620
contribute to and how much like who is

00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:53,020
asking to contribute to these projects

00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,250
right you can actually start to promote

00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,230
some of these projects you can even

00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:59,050
start funding some of these projects if

00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:01,770
you really like are relying on them also

00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:04,840
in large companies it's not uncommon for

00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:07,030
you know very different organizations to

00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,460
be relying on the same open source

00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,560
software and not even being aware of it

00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,490
so you you know as an ospa that owns

00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,170
this information you can suddenly start

00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:19,330
connecting these engineers together and

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:22,210
making them more effective at working

00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:24,460
together on these external projects um

00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,960
that's it that's what I have so if you

00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,330
have questions if you want a

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,330
conversation around this now's a great

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,750
time and I'll briefly just to remind

00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:37,450
everyone that though who knows typically

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,470
does not record its meetings except for

00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,599
the purpose of

00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,460
preparing minutes in this case in order

00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,440
to make sure that this presentation is

00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,510
available to our broader community we

00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,630
are planning on making a recording

00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:52,090
available so I just wanted to be clear

00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,740
about that before folks jump in with

00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,630
questions you'd like to jump if you'd

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,550
like to ask a question anonymously feel

00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:07,420
free to post it to me privately in the

00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:10,359
Chad and I Alaska vacation and a

00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:14,470
question about the developer introduced

00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:21,670
will note inside part of work inside of

00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:22,500
the company can you hear me yes

00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:26,770
absolutely

00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:28,930
okay so do you have you seen some

00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:31,720
company centralizing their contribution

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,960
under a few employees so instead of

00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:38,530
allowing all the engineers to contribute

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,960
they would do like a funnel or to send

00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:43,510
the contribution system senior engineers

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,230
and then they will review it and they

00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:50,980
contributions we have the company so I

00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:54,220
have not seen this personally but I'm

00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:58,359
sure they're like compare us do things

00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:01,990
in the widely different in one of the

00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:05,380
different ways right um in general the

00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:07,510
approach I recommend as you get real

00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:11,050
value out of contributing to open source

00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:15,339
if you doing that as building a culture

00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:19,830
that goes towards this um and we're you

00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:22,960
know every engineer should feel like

00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:25,000
this rather than having sort of like an

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,480
elite team somewhere that's responsible

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,500
for this um what you can build is a team

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,839
of people that have know-how that

00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,450
understand that opens was culture that

00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:40,210
can sort of be mentoring and help out

00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,810
but I would be careful of not making

00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:45,339
them gatekeepers because that tends to

00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:48,760
not really create the environment that

00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:51,510
is conducive to innovation and building

00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,510
a strong culture

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,849
anything does that in solution

00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:09,660
hey this is Rob Underwood from finis I

00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,180
put a comment in the chat I just wanted

00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,069
to underline Toby something you a point

00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,289
you made that I think is super important

00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:18,420
about especially United States

00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:22,079
employment agreements and the fact that

00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:25,589
they often are very expansive in terms

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:29,729
of their in terms of their claims around

00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:32,970
IP ownership and if you oftentimes you

00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:35,279
know the employee employment agreements

00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,539
will say as you discuss that anything

00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:40,049
that's done that's sort of in the

00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:41,579
general realm of the employer the

00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:43,259
employers lined-up business whether it's

00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:46,380
done on personal time on personal

00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:47,700
equipment becomes the property of the

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,220
employer I just wanted to contextualise

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,450
I know we've gotten a lot of questions

00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,309
and some of other some of the other

00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,589
fitness programs and projects about the

00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:58,339
choice of the corporate contributor

00:49:55,589 --> 00:50:01,099
License Agreement versus the individual

00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:07,319
contributor License Agreement it it's

00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:09,599
this often this clause and employment

00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:13,170
agreements it often exists is a big

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,180
reason why you know more often than not

00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,630
the corporate contributor License

00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:22,739
Agreement so sometimes a bit harder to

00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:24,479
execute is the right choice because the

00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,519
because of these employment agreements

00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,989
so don't want to turn this into a big

00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:29,249
discussion of the fitness contributor

00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:31,979
license agreements I know that that

00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:33,329
comes up and people sometimes look at

00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:36,119
the individual contributor license

00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:38,640
agreements as a perhaps an easier way to

00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,579
go but in many cases because of these IP

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,269
ownership clauses in employer agreements

00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:46,650
employee employer employee et agreements

00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:47,819
more often than not that contribute the

00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,400
corporate contributor License Agreement

00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:51,690
is the right choice because oftentimes

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,549
whether you know it or not the

00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:58,440
contributions you're making are in fact

00:50:55,549 --> 00:51:01,140
potential IP that are owned by your

00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,789
employer and I would also say in cases

00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,170
if you're a contractor could be the

00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:05,759
person that you're contracting with so

00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,140
it's not just if you're an employee but

00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:10,049
also if you're sort of on a full-time

00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,400
contract so I just want to provide that

00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:14,130
context that's come up in the community

00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,450
a lot recently so if it may feel like

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,619
the contributor the corporate

00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,150
contributor License Agreement takes a

00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,360
little bit longer to execute but that's

00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,840
why

00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,040
we often push for it yeah that's a

00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,030
that's a really good point

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:29,130
um it's interesting because and it also

00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:31,560
shows how you know lawyers tend to think

00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:34,190
in much more of a gray way around this

00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,780
because some you know different

00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,430
different lawyers working for different

00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,220
companies assessing the risk differently

00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:44,040
will have different perspectives on this

00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:45,300
but yes this explains why you're

00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,970
absolutely correct that this explains

00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:51,750
why corporate you know corporate CAS are

00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:56,490
often you know protect that the project

00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:59,040
more than individual ones I just say and

00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:01,140
they actually it protect the individual

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,930
- right so if you're an individual that

00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,790
works for a large bank and you know you

00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,790
were to execute an individual corporate

00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:13,440
and individual CLA and it turns out that

00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:16,140
what you're doing was in fact IP that

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,640
was owned by your employer you might

00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,110
find yourself in a spot you don't want

00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:28,500
to be and so you're better to have that

00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:33,660
leverage from your employer she'll hear

00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:36,240
just a comment on clas it in the company

00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:38,730
I work for the first corporate CLA we

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,310
had to sign took us three months to get

00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:44,220
approved by legal and various people who

00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:46,170
needed to go and sign it which means

00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:49,560
that the person who wanted to contribute

00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:52,650
was going to contribute in the contest

00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,990
and mr. deadline the second one that we

00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:57,630
did involving the same chain of command

00:52:54,990 --> 00:53:00,450
Tuukka month and a half because people

00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:02,850
still had the same questions I guess

00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:05,280
what I'm getting to you is make sure you

00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,950
brief people and you work with the same

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,140
team and they understand that the first

00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:12,030
time you try to do it what it means and

00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:15,210
and for the first time do it when you

00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:18,090
have time to do it yeah I would just add

00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:19,920
on that Jill's that so that's a good

00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,870
example of where this sort of the

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,720
scaling function of Finny's can come

00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:27,140
into play so for example we have a CCL a

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,000
with Wipro now right and that covers

00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:32,250
contribution to any of the 108 projects

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,390
within finis so we have one

00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,790
the things that we do is yes that

00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,370
upfront getting the CA CLA in place with

00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,380
a member or contributing organization

00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:42,360
within finis can take some upfront time

00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:46,050
but the good news is once it's in place

00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,580
then we're good to go I'm on all of the

00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,440
finis projects and then the scaling

00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:55,620
effects kind of come into play but

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:57,090
you're absolutely right and the the the

00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,950
Google ruled you know if it's less than

00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:01,050
100 lines of code you can contribute

00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,300
without asking us doesn't stop people

00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:04,650
from having to sign the CLA - for the

00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,230
project they wish to contribute to so

00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:10,260
it's a good rule it makes things simple

00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:12,120
but if the project you're contributing

00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,440
year two is cuber neatest you still have

00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,930
to get the corporate CLA or the

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,430
individual CEO in place yes absolutely

00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:22,740
and I think that rule was really

00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:25,920
targeted at more like the kind of code

00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:28,260
that you're releasing documentation for

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:33,990
examples or ensuing something on Stack

00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:35,790
Overflow absolutely and then you can

00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:40,710
publish as big as you want by blocks of

00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:44,190
100 lines multiple answers I mean you

00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,660
know no but you know I think like

00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,130
actually you know I think you're teasing

00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,360
but I think this is a really important

00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:54,060
aspect as if if you don't trust your

00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,910
engineers to be trying to do the right

00:54:54,060 --> 00:55:01,230
thing and if you suspect that they're

00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:04,470
going to try to you know run around the

00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:07,440
bar the blocks that are in in the

00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:09,720
process it's either that you should hire

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,720
different engineers on that your process

00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,970
is basically so difficult to follow that

00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,190
people are running around it right so I

00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:19,530
think it's a have seen that example oh

00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:22,050
yeah me too plenty of times you know

00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,360
process hormone around it in April that

00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:27,090
went around it and and also people that

00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,580
were just like not trustable in company

00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:32,520
right both of those are things that

00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,630
exist but you know again if you're

00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,740
thinking about that from a risk

00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:39,750
perspective and balancing risk was you

00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,400
know velocity and innovation in in

00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,690
getting engineer in engineering team

00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,030
story actually do the work that they

00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,900
want to do you have to write find the

00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,580
right spot

00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,740
and for a company like Google the right

00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:54,160
spot is to say well we trust people to

00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:57,460
release you know on code 100 or less 200

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,170
lines that we don't believe there's

00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,770
gonna be any risk and we trust them to

00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,770
do the right thing

00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:08,980
we have time for one more question

00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:08,980
anybody has

00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:19,520
okay in that case I will thank Toby for

00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:22,100
a terrific presentation and hope to see

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,960
all of you back in two weeks on our next

00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,120
call thanks for joining thank you so
