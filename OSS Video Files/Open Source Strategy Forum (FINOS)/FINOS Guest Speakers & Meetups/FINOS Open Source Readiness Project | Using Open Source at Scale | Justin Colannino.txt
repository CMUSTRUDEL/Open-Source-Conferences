today and sharing your

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,079
experience i know that the topic uh how

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,239
you do open source

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
advising at scale is going to be very

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
interesting to

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,360
everyone in attendance and i'm looking

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
forward to it myself

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
thanks aaron it's great to be working

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,759
with you again as aaron mentioned

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
we go back to probably 2008-2009 time

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,320
frame

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,680
um and then you know we're colleagues at

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
the software freedom law center so it's

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
always great to

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,400
um to work with you um yeah open source

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,920
advising at scale is something that uh

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
is is is fascinating to me um partially

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
because

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
you know when i when i found out the job

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,119
at microsoft

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,799
um and microsoft was looking for an open

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,240
source lawyer this was you know three or

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
four years ago

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
and you know my first instinct was you

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,720
know yeah right microsoft

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,280
like you're not an open source company

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
you know what

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
what are we what are we talking about

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,880
here and

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,079
um you know i went there and i met the

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,439
people and i found out whoa

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
whoa they're actually really trying to

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,600
become an open source company

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
and um over the last three or four years

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
we've really gone through a phased

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,399
transition in enabling engagement with

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,520
open source

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,520
from you know a policy a few years ago

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,680
you know as kind of you might you might

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
guess from the relationship in the

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,879
in the arts between the open source

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,840
community and microsoft

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,160
from a kind of just say no type policy

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
to

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
a you know you know say yes unless

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
otherwise

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,120
um unless there's some real issues type

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,400
of policy

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,840
and so i you know i've gone it's gone

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,680
from you know i just say no to advising

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
60 000 developers

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
about how to engage with open source

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
responsibly kind of on a daily basis

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
and so i'm going to talk a little bit

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
about how we think about

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
that process at microsoft how i think

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,720
about that process in

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,879
microsoft and how to um and if microsoft

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
can do it you can you can too

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,800
so let me share my screen and we'll get

00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,480
uh ready to go into the

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:03,680
the presentation can folks see that okay

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,680
yep looks good excellent so you know

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
of course a little disclaimer you know i

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,239
i am here

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,959
uh as justin not as microsoft um

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,680
but you know i'm here to help share what

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,840
i've learned

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
as an attorney at microsoft kind of

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
putting the puzzle pieces together on on

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,319
how to do this

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,120
at at massive massive scale so let's

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,680
we're going to talk uh in three three

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
basic

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,080
topics and you know the first is kind of

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,040
just a quick refresher

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,920
around what open source is and what we

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,879
care about

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,840
as people setting up a compliance

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
program for

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,319
for licensed compliance on the inbound

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,640
side um

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,239
with with open source licenses and that

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
also kind of bleeds over to the outbound

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,440
side a little bit as well so

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
basically you know what is open source

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,040
and and what are the different

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,519
types of licenses that you'll see in an

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
open source space

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
second i'm going to do a little bit of a

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
deep dive

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,040
into i think what it basically what a

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,239
critical area

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,720
is in open source law which is

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,439
what is the definition of a derivative

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,840
work

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
under u.s copyright law and what does

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360
that mean

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,479
for some of the open source licenses i'm

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
going to talk a little bit about how

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,919
because there's so little case law in

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,440
the open source

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,759
environment you need to make

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,560
tough calls sometimes and there isn't a

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,240
lot of

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479
basis for making the call and you just

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
need to kind of do the best you can

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,040
and finally i'm going to talk a little

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,960
bit about how i apply those principles

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,199
you know what is open source and

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,199
legal definitions as i think about you

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,160
know how to advise people across

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,120
you know 60 000 developers millions of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,680
use cases

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
on a on a monthly or yearly basis

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,360
so i i like to start here which is

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,360
to say that anybody can learn

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
kind of the technical and legal

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
underpinnings of

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
of open source licenses opens there's

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
only about 35

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
open source licenses that i see on a

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,400
regular basis i'd say that there's a

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,039
long tail that stretches down to around

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,199
200 or so that come across my desk on a

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,360
on like a quarterly basis

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,280
and so and a lot of them are you know

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
frankly poorly written they were written

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,320
by

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,919
developers or you know have a lot of

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,080
ambiguity in them

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,759
and the legal and technical application

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,720
of of kind of um i'd call it

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
a chopping wood type mentality or grunt

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
work

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
and kind of applying what those mean

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
sometimes

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
goes above the legal and technical and

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
into the you know social political and

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
economic

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
you know who are the people that put

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,039
this under this license so that they'd

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,639
be giving it away

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
for people to use modify and

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,080
redistribute

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,520
why did they do that what are their

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,120
goals

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,800
is important for understanding what

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
both how to interpret the licenses and

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,360
how you might you know resolve disputes

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
if they

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,199
if they come down the road for you so

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,440
using all of these

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
tools and understanding those

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
motivations both from economic political

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
and social

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
perspective is extremely important as

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
you engage

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
in this space

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,520
and applying that to counseling is um

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,759
also important so looking at this is

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,400
kind of how i like to think about

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
counseling at scale right on the on the

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160
one hand you have the

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,199
on the right hand side of the graph you

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,440
have custom

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
that's really hard to scale anything

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
that's custom really really hard to

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
scale

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
and on the left you have commodity which

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,479
is something that you can tool

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,759
you can have you know a docs page inside

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,160
your organization

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,360
that describes to people what exactly

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,639
they have to do

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,000
um and that that that can scale

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,599
and so it's very easy kind of on the if

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,639
you're doing kind of a rote legal

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,960
technical

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,479
application to be down on the left hand

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,919
side it's a little bit harder

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,160
in the social political economic space

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,360
to to move stuff from custom down to

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
commodity but what you should be

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
thinking about

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
at all times is once you've made a

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
custom call a few times

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,800
are there principles that you can take

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,360
out of those and push those down

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
into the econo i'm sorry push those down

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
into the commodity

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
the commodity space another another kind

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
of

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
line that i've drawn here is between the

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,759
legal and technical and the social

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,160
political economic

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,360
um i think a good way to think about

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
this is in legal and

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
technical there are a lot of um bright

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,160
line

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
rules which means you know you can

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,360
basically say like yes or no

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
very easily it's really easy to bucket

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,879
sort those issues

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,960
whereas um in in law we like to call

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
you know multi-factor tests or mushy

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
standards

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,039
um are the guide posts of the social

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,680
political economic things it's just

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,120
it's kind of the guidance you give is

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
more along the lines of

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,560
well you know here are the factors that

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
you need to be considering

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
and here are the principles by which our

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,800
organization stands

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
um and so therefore my advice is x and

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
you can

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,840
and you can scale that by codifying

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,599
those principles so that others can make

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
them within the organization

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,520
and be kind of true to the guiding light

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,360
and that's easier to do

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,039
to make that commodity advice in the

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,719
economic political social with those

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,120
guideposts or mushy standards

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
than it is with brightline rules because

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
um there aren't a lot of brightline

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,279
rules in those

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,080
in those types of scenarios

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,399
so that said let's move to kind of the

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,839
the crucial question and open uh or one

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
of the crucial questions you know what

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
is open source

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,959
open source is just a it's a it's a set

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
of software that's under a license

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,480
which begs the question you know what is

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,160
a license

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,200
so does anyone want to um you know

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:09,839
bravely unmute and and venture an answer

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,839
to this question

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
you thought you'd just be on mute the

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
whole time and do some other work at the

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
same time as hearing my presentation

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,880
anybody

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,080
it's basically terms under which you can

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,839
use the software

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,200
right thank you um i didn't i didn't

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
catch you said that but thank you for

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,839
for venturing an answer um i actually

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
i'd actually say it's a little bit

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
simpler than that or you know

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,519
it's actually just kind of permission

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,600
right and so

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
a license doesn't need to have terms

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,480
attached to it at all

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,080
it can just say you could if you say to

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
somebody hey like go ahead and take this

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,760
and

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,080
and do something with it that's

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
essentially a license right it's just

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
the permission

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,440
and that would be you know um to to this

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,120
to the speaker's point

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
the terms and conditions there would be

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
you know there are none just just go

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,519
ahead and do it

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,240
um so you know i'd qualify it to

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
to get more in line with what the um you

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
know what the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,880
answer or speaker just said which is you

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
know permissions sub

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,320
usually subject to conditions or

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,240
obligations now this is different than a

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
than a contract because a contract

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
requires

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,320
um an agreement between two people or

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,399
you know in

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
in or at least in the us law a meeting

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,079
of the minds

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,839
a license is just permission and then

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,600
sets out the meets and bounds

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
around what which that permission is

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,880
granted so you know you think of a

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,560
driver's license

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
that license is issued by the state and

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,560
the terms and conditions are

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,079
you know don't speed or too much and you

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,800
know don't drink and drive

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,240
um or your license will be revoked

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,920
similarly

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,160
open source licenses or licenses

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,720
generally say you know here are the ways

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
that you're

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,399
this is what you can do and here are the

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,079
uh things that would

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,160
lead to termination of your license

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,800
either termination through notice or

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,079
automatic termination so really it's

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
just kind of um

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,120
you know a simple bargain if we distill

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
down

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,480
what you know open source licenses are

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
in terms of both the conditions and the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,079
i'm sorry the permissions

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
and the conditions or obligations um

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,880
it's essentially

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
you know the right to you know the four

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,320
freedoms from the free software

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,279
foundation which is the right to use

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
copy modify and redistribute your

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,399
modifications

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,120
um to to anyone um

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,480
but you need to meet the conditions or

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,959
obligations and there

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,920
there are a lot of licenses but you can

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,680
basically put

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,240
the obligations into two buckets um

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
which are you know number one provide

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
notice this is if you're using the

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
software

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
now if you're kind of contributing or

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,800
kind of modifying it

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,480
online or you know doing some kind of

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,560
open source project there are some other

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,279
considerations here but on the using

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
side

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,880
you typically just need to provide

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,839
notice that you're using the the um

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,040
the component and sometimes provide uh

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,040
source code along with it

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,360
and so taking that as as kind of our

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
our foundational practice we can kind of

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
skip

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,360
through the license archetypes which

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,600
basically there are there are five

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
buckets they're the ultra permissive

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,200
licenses going down all the way to

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,480
network copyleft and they're increasing

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
obligations

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,200
that go along with each one of these um

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,880
these types of of of

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:37,040
licenses and so let me just quickly

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,040
walk through some examples

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,720
of these types of licenses and i'm i'm

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
gonna

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,560
and also touch briefly on what copyleft

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
means for those of us who

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,839
who haven't gotten there because it's

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,120
gonna matter down the road

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,000
so ultra permissive licenses the goal of

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
people who put stuff

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,279
under ultra permissive licenses is that

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,600
it's maximum rights

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,639
um no obligations and i'd invite people

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
to look up

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,040
a license called the wtfpl which i don't

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,480
recommend anybody uses

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,279
but it's the what the f public license

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
and it's really a parody license of of

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,720
the gpl

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
but the terms and conditions for

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,959
modifying use and redistribute as you do

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
just do what you want to

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,120
um it's a little bit more colorful than

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,279
that but that really is what it says

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
and so the goal of that license is look

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,560
i'm giving you all the rights you need

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,480
you don't need to do anything and so

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,720
that's an ultra ultra permissive license

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,560
uh there are some others in that in that

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,160
space the unlicensed or the creative

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
commons zero license

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,839
all don't have you don't need to do

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,199
anything in order to take advantage of

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,480
the permissions

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
that relate to the license

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,800
permissive license is also very widely

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
used easy to use or

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
semi easy to use which we'll get to in a

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,880
second the goal there

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,639
is to give you maximum rights with

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
minimum obligations and the minimum

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,760
obligations

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
is this attribution obligation which is

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,199
that you provide the copyright statement

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,440
of the author typically

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,000
and you pass along the license

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
information along with the license

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
there's an interesting discussion going

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,399
on in a open source lawyer mailing list

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,959
right now about about some of the terms

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,959
that go along with permissive licenses

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,240
namely the permissive license basically

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,279
just says you can do what you want with

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,880
this software in

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,040
an object or or source code form

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,399
but you know and then it has this huge

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,079
warranty disclaimer in all

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,600
caps and that attribution obligation

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,600
that passes along the license

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,440
i believe is an attempt by the drafters

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
this goes back to the 80s so you know

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,360
when i was a kid

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
but um i believe goes back to the

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,920
purpose of

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,839
let's pass along those um warranty and

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,760
and disclaimers so that the original

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,240
author can't be held liable for what

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
some

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,600
person does with this software down the

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,880
road because it's kind of unforeseeable

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,959
what someone could do

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,320
given these kind of broad obligations

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,279
that are that are

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,040
going along so now we get to the

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,440
copyleft licenses

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,440
which all have source availability

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
obligations that run along with them of

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,800
various flavors

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,399
um now the idea of copyleft is that

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,880
copyleft is essentially a hack on

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,760
copyright law it says

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,480
you can use this software and you know

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,959
modify

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,360
it redistribute it you know however you

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,040
want to but when you redistribute this

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
software you need to give people the

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
same ability

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
to interact with and learn how the

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,839
software operates by providing source

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,920
code to them

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,000
and so that's a that is a condition of

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,079
using the license so you know not doing

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
that amounts you know in the in the

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,680
drafters view

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,240
amounts to copyright infringement and so

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,320
it it

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,920
it the idea is that it creates a

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,040
snowball effect

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,720
um that runs along with the software

00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:00,000
to improve functionality in that in that

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,680
program or set of programs

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,880
um weak copy left has a very bright line

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,399
as to what um you know what the source

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
availability obligations

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
are so if you're working in a with a

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,519
software library

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
and software libraries are basically a

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,079
set of core functionality you could

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,199
imagine

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,880
a library around cryptography or or

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,120
something a little simpler sorting

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,160
various ways of sorting lists

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,680
right that library instead of every time

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,480
you need to sort a list

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,839
you write a new uh function that sorts

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,680
lists for you

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
a library something you can reuse that

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
can take various sorts of

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,120
various types of lists and sort them in

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,160
various ways you know alphabetical

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
numerical

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,279
um you know what have you and so a goal

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,160
when people apply a weak copy left

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,839
license to to that sort of functionality

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,240
the goal is typically to preserve

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,240
freedom or the ability to kind of use

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,480
modify and redistribute that software

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,880
in source form in that core set of

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,880
functionality so if i take that sorting

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,279
algorithm i and there's a new use case

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,360
for it and so i tweak it slightly

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
when i distribute it to others they can

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,120
get the benefit of my tweaks

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
or their their i'm obligated to give

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,959
them the benefits of my my tweaks under

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,319
under the license and that's the that's

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,760
the point there so

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,640
the idea is to have this kind of bright

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,439
line around around that in lgpl

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
that's kind of around linking which is a

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,199
way of

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,480
of calling functionality in a

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,600
in a programmatic way mpl is the mozilla

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
public license

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
that is basically you know if you're

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,679
using

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,400
source under the mpl in a file you need

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
to produce

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,640
um that source file as part of your

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
source disclosure obligations

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,120
the epl is a little trickier you'll see

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,000
i put a question mark under there it

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,160
runs to it's

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
heavily used in the java space so it's

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
basically around

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,039
um or thought to run around um

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,919
jar files which are java archive files

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,600
that

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,840
that are different modules of software

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
that get shipped around the java

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,240
ecosystem but i put a question mark

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,400
there because

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,640
i'm going to get to that in a little bit

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
um copy left

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,760
the distribution it's exactly like weak

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,320
copy left except the

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,600
there's no or less of a bright line the

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,240
distribution triggers

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,400
uh source code obligations for all

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
derivative works of the program

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,679
and the question of what derivative work

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,799
is is

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,919
one that um is highly

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,480
unknown and i hate to tell clients this

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,640
but

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,000
um if a lawyer says like yeah the bound

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,760
i'm very clear on what the boundary

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,720
between derivative works and not and

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,120
software

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,840
is in the united states at least um

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
they're

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,880
i don't think they i don't i don't think

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,799
they're right

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
because you know i think it's highly

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,559
unknown what a court's actually going to

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
do

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
because it's never really been litigated

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
and there's not a lot of case law that's

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,799
directly on point

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
um and then finally network copyleft the

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,960
the goal there

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,720
is to extend copyleft for

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,480
for kind of cloud services so if you're

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
interacting with the program over a

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
network

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,840
um there's a source code obligation that

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,960
that runs along with it that's the same

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,520
extent as the um the

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,200
the the derivative works obligations

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,480
under copyleft it's just that the

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,840
the triggering act for the obligation

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
um occurs on interaction over a network

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,360
which is

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
also kind of hard hard to grok under the

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
the license

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
so there's a little bit of ambiguity

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,360
there but it occurs on network

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
interaction rather than um

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,039
actual distribution of the binary bits

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,720
or source code bits to a third party

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,160
so that was a bit of a that was a bit of

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,919
a a long-winded

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,760
um introduction to uh open source

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,039
uh licensed archetypes i wanna pause

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,679
there to make sure that there are no

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:52,240
questions before i move on to the next

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,559
um you know the next slides

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
hey justin great anthony uh quick

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,720
question

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,280
the term distribution triggers just to

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,679
be clear

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,799
what does distribution um mean to you

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,320
um well so distribution um

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,679
essentially means taking the

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,919
uh the software and giving it

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,200
in either source or binary to somebody

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,720
else

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,640
and when you say someone else is that

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
within the company or outside of the

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,880
company

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,200
no no it's outside of the company okay

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,640
there's interesting issues and and and

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,760
debates around

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,679
like things like um vendors and

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,799
and whatnot that that you need to be

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,120
aware contractor

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,159
so a contractor that is contracted to

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,200
the company

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,600
still is within the company

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
well i i it that depends on the facts

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,159
and certainly that's what i mean by

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
there's a debate around that is you know

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
they're they're

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,080
that that's heavily fact dependent on on

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,360
different facts and circumstances around

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,120
you know how closely the vendors tied to

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,240
the company and that kind of thing

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,120
and then network interaction triggers is

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,640
network traffic inside the company or

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
outside the company just want to make

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,760
clear it's outside the company i'm

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
assuming

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,799
uh yeah i would be with somebody you

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,799
know outside the company

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
although you can look i mean google has

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,520
a public position on this

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,720
that the the idea of network interaction

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
and vendors

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,080
inside the company scares them so much

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,039
that they ban agpl for that reason

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,640
if you look at the the google docs page

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,840
there they have an overview of why they

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,840
believe that to be the case

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,240
cool thank you yeah

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,960
so i i put a pin in a few things and i

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
want to and i want to try to hit them

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
here

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,280
um so permissive i said you know

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,039
the the idea of you know the attribution

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,320
obligation being easy

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,559
um well yeah that's that's kind of true

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,000
um and you know this is the only latin i

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
don't like to use latin as a lawyer i

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,640
think it's a little pretentious but i

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,799
really like this saying

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,640
um you know faculty deep to defecally

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,679
focus which means you know easy to say

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,000
difficult to do

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,440
so yeah just provide attribution made a

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,480
lot of sense in the

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,159
in you know when programs were smaller

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,679
what i'm showing you here is um

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,799
until recently the current version of

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,840
the the notices file for

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,799
one of microsoft's project for vs um

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,520
for visual studio that ran was manually

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,039
maintained by a paralegal that ran

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,000
1500 pages long and you know was still

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,720
growing it was

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,880
i'd say essentially a half-time job just

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,799
kind of maintaining this

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,559
you know accurately on a going forward

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,320
basis and so

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,679
you know while it's really you know it

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,679
was easy to say like you know just

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,400
provide attribution doing it in a

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,200
structured and um you know thoughtful

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
way

00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:00,480
is it can be very difficult okay

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,720
so that covers our um

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,760
you know our kind of refresher on on

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
open source

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,679
licensing um for folks just to kind of

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
get an idea of where the

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,360
pitfalls are and what the what the

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,240
licenses cover let's move

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,840
into um a little bit around that

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
derivative work question

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,120
so that people kind of have an idea of

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,799
why i think that there isn't

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,320
a ton of good guidance um in this space

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,760
so again you know let's you know

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,280
while we think about this let's think

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
about that entire stack i think that's

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,600
an

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
important takeaway i think something

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,679
that i'd like to pass

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,039
on um is this idea that you really need

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,240
to kind of look at that full

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,640
full stack when you're thinking about

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,320
what you're doing so let's

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
i'm going to do a quick technical aside

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
i know there are a lot of technical

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,919
people on the call so i'll try to make

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,960
this brief

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,159
um derivative work is often tied in the

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,360
in the literature and

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,120
and and in the explanations of licenses

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,200
to this concept of linking

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,799
um and sometimes people try to draw a

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,000
distinction between

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,039
um uh linking

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,720
in the uh

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
in the static sense and linking in the

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
dynamic sense so let's let's just get an

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
idea of like what those are

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,360
functionally down at the bottom of the

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,360
stack of the technical

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,640
and then try to apply the the kind of

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,799
legal analysis

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,400
or as best we can to what that looks

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
like so

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
what is linking you have a program

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
that's in green you have a library

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,919
that's an

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,679
orange your program wants to use some

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,400
functionality let's call it sorting a

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,039
list

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,279
right so what happens is your program

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,559
starts at the top and it executes until

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,960
it says hey like

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,600
you know sort the list and what happens

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,400
is

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,400
the the compiler when when that source

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
code is turned into object code it goes

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,480
out and it

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,840
takes from the library code that the

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,840
compiler has access to

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,919
and it just literally copies and pastes

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640
or not well not literally but

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,320
essentially copies and pastes that

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,559
function for sorting

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,240
into your program so that your program

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,480
can execute it it

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,320
executes that function for sorting

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,919
returns the sorted list to your program

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,600
and your program keeps executing

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
so it essentially just kind of copies

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,039
and pastes in

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,559
from the library into the program it's a

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,919
little more complicated than that but

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,440
that's that's essentially what the

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,799
compiler is doing

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,279
when you're using a library statically

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:26,000
linked with your program

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,840
so what is dynamic linking i think

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the key difference between dynamic and

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,240
static linking is that

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,360
in dynamic linking the

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,000
the running of the library function is

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,480
done

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,559
during execution of the program so

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,960
instead of having the entire

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,279
um that function the functions that you

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,039
need copied into your program instead

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,039
your program's executing it wants to

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,440
sort a list it calls

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,240
out to the library so in the computer

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
the computer

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,679
dumps the program from memory loads the

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,480
library program

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,279
up with the with what's um with the the

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
context

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,640
for what it's been passed which is that

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,440
list that's going to be sorted

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,440
that library executes and then returns

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,880
the list to the program

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,120
um returns a list to the program and

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,760
then the program continues to

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,720
uh continues to execute and so the

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,200
difference here

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,039
is that none of the library is copied

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
into the program at all

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,720
they're they're kind of some technical

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,559
um

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,640
uh there's some technical goodness with

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,400
either one for the dynamic linking you

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,240
can replace the library very easily

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,679
without recompiling the program so it's

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,600
kind of easy to update

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,600
um you know programs that are out in the

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,720
wild on devices and whatnot

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,480
um with static linking um you get some

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,240
performance enhancements at least in

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,039
kind of the c ecosystem which is

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,320
uh what i grew up in and what um i'm

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,320
more familiar with than

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
these kind of fancy javascript things

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,279
that a lot of people are doing nowadays

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,600
um any questions on on this kind of

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:04,400
quick technical aside before i

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,400
uh before i move on to the legal uh

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
pieces

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,159
okay so the hearing nothing that the

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
kind of key difference here is that

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,600
that we should take away into the next

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,559
piece is static linking you're actually

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
copying the thing

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,120
into the program dynamic linking you're

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,000
not all right

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
so what is the derivative work of

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,720
software

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,520
okay let's look at the statute what does

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,600
the statute say it's a derivative work

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,279
is a work based upon one or more

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,039
pre-existing works

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,799
such as a translation musical

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,480
arrangement dramatization

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,120
fictionalization motion picture version

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,919
sound recording art reproduction

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
abridgement

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,320
condensation or any other form in which

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,120
a work may be recast

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,279
transformed or adapted so

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,279
let's continue editorial revisions

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,360
annotations elaborations

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,039
or other modifications which represent

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,320
an original work of authorship is a

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,159
derivative work

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
all of these things have no application

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,520
to software at all

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,399
except through analogy so there's not a

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,200
lot of

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,200
you know helpful

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,039
guidance here from from congress when

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,200
they added

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,039
um software to the statute they didn't

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,760
update this definition at all

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,880
um to apply to software so we're kind of

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,520
left to figure out

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,679
hey what a courts uh say about that

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,039
which brings us to the 90s

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,919
and some video game cases which i think

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,919
are the most

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
relevant in this space there are other

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,360
cases that

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,120
have relevance as well but i i think

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,399
that those are also kind of tangential

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,960
tangentially related to the same extent

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,720
kind of

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,360
video games are and i i view these as

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,559
the kind of two leading cases as you're

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,000
considering your analysis so let's start

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,840
with game genie for those of you who

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,880
don't know what game janie is

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,000
let's have a 30 second refresher game

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
over

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,320
no way because we got game genie we tell

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,320
you when to chill

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,399
in the game genie i decide how many

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,960
lives i get i usually want to live

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,360
forever

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,960
play to the end and win maybe i want to

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,760
start on level 15.

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,720
no problemo it makes cool games like

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,960
street fighter 2

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,080
more exciting less frustrating game

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
genie it ain't over

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,520
should we say it's sober excellent

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
genie for any super nes sega and game

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,720
boy called so many popular games each

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559
old separately

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,399
so i hope you were able to to get the

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,039
sound yeah that's that's a blast from

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,279
the past

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,880
so uh this was very popular when i was

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,039
eight to ten years old

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,640
um so i was like right in the sweet spot

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,640
for for game genie

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
um working as you can tell they they

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,880
didn't mind uh knocking off

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,880
um different types of copyright i mean

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,960
that that kind of evokes phil and

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,000
bill and ted's excellent adventure a

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,399
little bit too much

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,880
uh for my for my taste i don't even know

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
if it could qualify as a parody or under

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,000
fair use or anything like that but

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,720
uh they did it anyway um so

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,039
what game genie essentially was it was a

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,039
cartridge that you put between

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,600
the um the the game cartridge back in

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,880
the day

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,799
when you took a video game you take a

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,880
cartridge and you would put it into

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,799
the machine and then you turn on like

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,520
nintendo or sega genesis or anything

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,120
like that

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,880
and that would um then um

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,159
you know then the game would operate

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,000
that would load the game into memory and

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,080
whatnot and off you'd go

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
game genie would put some a cartridge in

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,880
between those two cartridges

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,880
and then change the registers that

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,559
so in nintendo or sega in the in the

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,559
game platform

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,960
so that you could have things like extra

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,960
lives or the ability to jump extra high

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,640
or you know various other kind of

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,600
enhancements and cheat codes and that

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,840
kind of thing so

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,960
it was basically like modding the game

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,760
using a

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,399
uh using a a cartridge that would would

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,159
modify

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,640
the the um registers inside the nintendo

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,640
or

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,080
or sega genesis so that was an

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,760
unlicensed

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,720
um uh modding program

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,519
nintendo sued and i think sega did as

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,640
well

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,080
uh game genie saying uh look

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,960
um you're unlicensed to use this on our

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,000
platform

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,399
and what you're doing is creating a

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,919
derivative work of our licensed games

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
like super mario brothers you know

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,720
giving

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,240
you know in the derivative work was look

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
you know you can jump extra high

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,080
and you know mod the uh mod the lives

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,799
and and whatnot

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,039
and so um the ninth circuit which is a

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,360
court of appeals in the united states so

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,320
you know has some and and kind of

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,799
heavily

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,440
thought of as a copy copyright court

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,960
because

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,000
of its uh proximity to hollywood

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,720
says no that's that's not a derivative

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,120
work

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,480
and one of the uh rationales behind that

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,880
decision was

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,519
no part of super mario brothers let's

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,720
say

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,799
was copied by the game genie um at

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,480
all um they were actually just changing

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,120
the registers on the

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,200
nintendo itself so the fact that you

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,120
know even though the

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,519
that when booted up in memory there was

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,720
there was a game that essentially was a

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,519
little bit different

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,880
than super mario brothers that game was

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,080
just ephemeral

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,519
and there was no actual copying

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,039
of super mario brothers into the game

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,960
genie and therefore the game genie

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,480
couldn't be a derivative work

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,480
of super mario brothers itself and um

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,519
and and so there was a bright line there

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,919
for a moment

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,360
around you know okay so i didn't copy

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,919
any of the original

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,600
therefore i um i didn't make a

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,919
derivative work and so that's the

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,760
that's the game genie case and so that

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,880
that what's interesting about this case

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,039
in the timing

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
is that this is a around a year after

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,360
the the gpl was written in the gpl you

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,360
know the famous copyleft license

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,039
that extended to the extent of a

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,519
derivative work so people would look to

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,399
this case and say look brightline rule

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,120
dynamic linking okay static linking not

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,960
okay

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,640
and the reason is because in dynamic

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,159
linking you're not copying any of the

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,320
library into the program

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,960
you're just them side by side this looks

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,200
a lot like the game genie case

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,200
so there's another case

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,919
that comes up next which is duke nukem

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,600
now uh i'm gonna let duke nukem play in

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,240
the background a little bit while i

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,600
um you know continue to go it's a first

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,320
person shooter game

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,960
um you run around a map killing bad guys

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,640
with your

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,240
pistols or whatever weapons that you

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,679
pick up you run around

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,880
um in various locations and and see

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,000
kind of various things um

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,840
and so this was a kind of you know or

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,440
you know early in the genre of first

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
first person shooters you see a bad guy

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,480
right there

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,440
as we've kind of stopped running running

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,880
through

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,039
um the the way that this

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,720
or what led to the dispute that was

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,520
decided by the ninth circuit you know

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,639
six years after the game genie case

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,599
was that the author of uh

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,919
duke nukem which i believe was microstar

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,839
the author of duke nukem went out

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,839
and um

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,399
allowed people to write their own levels

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,040
for duke nukem and they provided a level

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,399
editor

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,800
and the restriction on the level editor

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,960
said

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,320
any output of this can only be used for

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,560
non-commercial

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,639
non-commercial use so so the idea was

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,399
you get basically a bunch of fans

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,960
building other levels and sharing them

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,079
on bulletin boards or you know on aol

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,839
back in 1998 or whatever it was to kind

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,280
of enhance the functionality of the game

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,000
overall

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,560
and and kind of generate a broader user

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,639
base

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,599
so what happened was the defendant in

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,880
this case

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,920
again i believe it's formgen um went

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,920
out and scooped up

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,839
all of them remember this is the 90s so

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,560
you know low bandwidth etc

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,440
scooped up all of the level files that

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,440
they could find

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,680
about 500 of them and burned them onto a

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,440
cd and then offered that for sale

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,800
and um you know the duke nukem publisher

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
sued and said hey uh you know you've

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,599
created derivative work of duke nukem

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,240
when you just

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,000
uh send these ship these levels around

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,400
and in a very entertaining

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
um opinion that now disgraced judge

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,359
kaczynski

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,359
um held know that these level editors

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,640
were a derivative work of duke nukem and

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
there were a few different reasons for

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,160
that

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,240
but let me just talk a little bit about

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,240
how those level editors worked

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,520
no part of duke nukem was copied into

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,560
the level editor at

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,440
all the level the map file was literally

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,680
just

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,680
like some codes that say like you know

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,040
that that were interpreted by duke nukem

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,480
to be like body armor

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,400
bad guy gun wall um

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,839
window you know etc there was nothing

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,160
that was in the level file that was

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,800
part of the duke nukem game in fact you

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,560
could write a different game that could

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,040
interpret that map editor with different

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,400
graphics etc right but nobody had

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,079
but you could and so what kaczynski

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,839
said was and so you know the the

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,359
defendant in the case said well look you

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,480
know in the game genie case

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:32,000
some direct copying was required so

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,680
therefore um you know we

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,040
you know there we didn't do any direct

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,079
copying and therefore it can't be a

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,200
derivative work

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,560
the judge said no no not not so fast

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,359
the these map files are designed

00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,680
specifically to work

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,560
with the um you know the duke nukem game

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,920
and therefore they you know therefore

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,800
they're they're not playable with

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,400
anything else that's

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,079
that's by definition kind of the

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,240
derivative work and then there's a

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,359
footnote it's footnote five in the case

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,040
that says well you know if there were

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,880
a bunch of this is kind of a standard

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,720
thing and there were a bunch of

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,160
different first person shooter things

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,839
that could read these map fires

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
interpret them different ways we might

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,160
reach a different

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,880
conclusion here the other thing to note

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,920
is that

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,280
this is copyright law so my overarching

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
principle kind of going up to the top of

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,119
the stack is judges like to punish

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,160
people who they think are being naughty

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,920
and i think that uh you know generally

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,920
uh the court thought that the the

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,839
defendant in this case was being naughty

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,040
and game genie was innovative and this

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,040
was just kind of like

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,200
you know profiting on somebody else's

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,200
stuff and so there's a very kind of

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,880
there's a kind of a an equity or a

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,079
fairness um

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,599
type of flavor to the opinion as well

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,280
the the other point i'd make is that

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,240
there's there's a there's another line

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
of reasoning which is

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,760
you know essentially you're selling a

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,200
sequel to duke nukem right like

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,839
even though you need the original duke

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,480
nukem game in order to use the the map

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,160
editors

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,240
um you're just selling a sequel and a

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,280
sequel is is in the statute as

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,200
is essentially being um you know it

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,400
or or falls more clearly in the statute

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,079
is um

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,920
as being something subject to the

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,119
derivative work right

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,760
therefore blockable by uh microstar so

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,440
so right clear is mud right but that's

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,079
that's what we have or i think those are

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,960
the two

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,480
kind of cases that i'd lean on there

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,560
might be some others

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,880
if forced to litigate this issue which i

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,240
hope i never am

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,160
so that brings us to back to the eclipse

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
public license and let's talk a little

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,040
bit about like

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,960
you know now that we've gone and done a

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,880
deep dive like you know you be the

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,520
lawyer for a little bit

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,280
um and like what is a derivative work

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,280
and what's the extent of copyleft you

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,440
know do you believe it's dynamic linking

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,599
or static linking or both

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
um you know is it an interesting

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,160
question

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,640
for you to to ponder but

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,160
um we talked about the eclipse public

00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,800
license having these bright lines

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,480
typically

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,200
thought to be around kind of jar files

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,880
well does the eclipse license actually

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,079
have that bright line as its written

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,400
this is eclipse version

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,839
version one it says basically the

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,119
copyleft extends to

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:17,920
changes or additions to the program but

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,599
doesn't extend the things that are not

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,040
derivative works of the program so in

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,280
order for

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,640
the copyleft provisions in the eclipse

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,200
public license

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,839
not to reach um not to reach you know

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,280
other parts those parts need to not be

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,960
derivative works of the program

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,400
which begs the question what does that

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,160
mean does that mean

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,760
static linking does that mean dynamic

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,000
linking this is typically

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,960
java for eclipse so you know it's

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,599
typically

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,320
dynamically linked well you know what's

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
great about

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,599
these non-profit uh entities that stand

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
up licenses they often have faq so let's

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,240
do what eclipse says

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,400
that they meant when they said

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,880
derivative works

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,920
they say well well what is linking does

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,280
it does it mean that your

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,760
program's a derivative work or not

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,640
that's the faq and then they say no we

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
don't know

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,040
it means whatever it means under u.s law

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
thanks eclipse foundation that doesn't

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,839
um that doesn't help

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,839
us at all so they punted

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,079
um but if you go online to

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,960
kind of popular resources around

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,000
licensing

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,000
what you'll see is this is from tldr

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,640
legal what you'll see is that

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
it's similar to the gpl but allows you

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,520
to link

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,720
code under the license to proprietary

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,000
application that's a very

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,800
clear statement by tl

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,359
tldr legal and that green check mark in

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,560
tldr legal if you click through

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,599
it means that uh it's advertised as mean

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,880
that a prominent

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,760
attorney from a very large and

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,119
wealthy law firm has has signed off on

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,280
this guidance

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,720
so given what we just learned about kind

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,119
of dynamic linking

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,560
and derivative works and kind of gpl

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,480
trying to extend that far

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,400
and maybe the eclipse license

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,800
potentially explaining that far too like

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,119
why would somebody you know at a large

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,960
law firm who's prominent in the field

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,160
you know be comfortable making this kind

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,240
of green check mark

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,119
assertion that you can link against this

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,359
and even if eclipse won't do it

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,720
and the answer is the top of this the

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,880
top of the stack

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,400
the in the eclipse community the people

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
who are using the license in java

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,079
they've

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,920
forever it's meant jar files if it's a

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,640
different jar file it's fine if it's not

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
then

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,880
then you need to release the source and

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,880
so

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,880
understanding if we're if we're just

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,400
going to apply the legal and technical

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,839
to our decision making we can get

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,760
trapped in areas that are go against the

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,000
customs of the people that are are

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,119
actually using these shared resource

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,960
licenses

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,319
and so that's something to keep in mind

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,920
as you're making your calls and we

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,520
transition to thinking about

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,200
you know what do we what do we mean what

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,880
does it mean to counsel at scale

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,720
and and we're making that transition

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,040
indeed

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,520
um any questions on that module before i

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,520
move on

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,319
okay so i will so how do i think about

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,079
canceling at scale so let me let me put

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,640
my framework up one more time

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,440
again the goal is to move things from

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,760
right to left

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,599
custom to commodity on the bottom parts

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
draw as many bright line rules as you

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,160
can on the top

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,440
use guideposts or principles okay that's

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,160
that's really the

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,000
the the framework that i use and you can

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,079
use this in any area

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,040
um that you're counseling i'd say you

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,760
know

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,280
it's broadly applicable to law generally

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,319
so how do we think about it in the open

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,079
source space

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:54,160
okay it's an iterative process

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,319
right the first thing that you do is you

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,680
discover kind of like where is your

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,480
guidance needed

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,760
right you investigate the solution to

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,280
that

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,240
i wouldn't write tooling at that point

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,160
i would then take that solution and turn

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,960
it into a human

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,319
heavy process right that can be just

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,240
documentation

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,079
you know you could imagine whitelist

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,480
blacklist like net like google

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,839
network copyleft not okay right

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,319
everything else okay

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,680
or you know okay with you know provided

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,319
that you do these things

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,359
checklists that kind of thing and then

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,839
you enforce

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,599
those as after that human process

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,720
settles down you have a good

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,720
idea for what it is

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,000
then you automate it by building tools

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,960
that reinforce

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,680
that system if you do this out of order

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,000
and you tool

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,680
first then you end up having a lot of

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,280
iteration on the tooling

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,960
and that and that can hurt

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,720
um a large organization like microsoft

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,200
um one of the things that we went

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,400
through in in my practice was that our

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,440
tooling

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,119
was um

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,040
was changing very rapidly it moved

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,160
around from team to team

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,960
and we had 150 lawyers responsible for

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,440
doing

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,680
kind of our frontline review for for the

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,960
exception cases that got thrown

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,800
that as part of that kind of like

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,200
discovery investigate process and they

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,200
would

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,119
and as would change the tooling as like

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,720
a new a new team would take over and say

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,359
oh we could do this much better in this

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,119
way

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:32,480
um educating those 150 lawyers

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,000
to actually you know to know why they

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,560
were looking at what they were looking

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,040
at

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,319
was was harder than actually changing

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,280
the tools so actually

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,040
getting a clear documented process that

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,000
people work through is much better than

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,000
kind of like

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,079
moving tooling um moving tooling around

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,440
i think maybe i could give a give an

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,160
example here so at microsoft

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,680
what we do is we we get right into our

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,680
developer tools

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,000
with our with our open source discovery

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,560
process so that that discover

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,240
it kind of leads to two things one is

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,599
where are you using open source in your

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,800
organization

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,720
um in in a lot of places like npm nuget

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,920
the packaged ecosystems it's very easy

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,599
to discover

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,680
because you have log files and that kind

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,800
of things in your repository that tell

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,920
you what the

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,760
um what the components are and what

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,240
their dependencies are

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,079
that you're that you're using in your in

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,800
your program so discovering that

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,319
cataloging it um getting detection

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,839
around it

00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,720
is critical and then deciding you know

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,680
what are the things that we are

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,280
concerned about

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,280
like what are we going to block on what

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,599
are we going to require people

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,280
to do more on is important so you need

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,920
to tell people for example you need

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,880
you need to make a notice file um that

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,400
kind of thing

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
um we've automated that notice file i'll

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,480
get to that in a minute but you know we

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,280
bl you know you block on things

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,319
that you know require human attention

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,319
and you automate

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,680
automate the rest and so then the

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,040
question is you know

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,200
where are you going to block found a

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,960
bunch of components recently

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,720
that are under um that are available

00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,160
on like kind of widely available on

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,760
nougat npm

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,800
but they're actually under a commercial

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,599
license so they're dependent like

00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,480
subdependencies of things that we're

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,160
using

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,160
but it's under some random commercial

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,839
license how do you deal with that

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,599
getting a process with our procurement

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,599
team et cetera to make sure that

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,680
that when we tell people hey you can't

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,720
use this that they have been a process

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,040
to go and get

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,160
the the licenses that they need is

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,920
extremely important

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,280
if they want to go and get them that

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,839
kind of thing so you catch it as it

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,800
comes

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,480
and you develop a process a human

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,040
process first and then a tool process

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,880
second

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,760
once that human process settles down

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,640
and so the tenants that we use here um

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,319
are to get

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,079
right into the developer tool it's built

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,240
into the tool you get an alert

00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,680
in your ci cd continuous integration

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,920
continuous deployment

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,560
system um when you're using open source

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,160
that we think needs you know needs

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,000
attention

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,680
we try to keep it really simple like

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,520
what are the obligations that that you

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,000
need to pay attention to

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,520
um you know given the various use cases

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,040
and then again we try to turn that

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,559
customer bespoke

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,559
um into commodity

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,920
in the use area i think it's really

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,240
helpful

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,400
to think about you know what is it that

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,440
we're trying to

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,400
what do we care about really and i

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,839
think the the answer to that is is we

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,520
care about

00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,200
like like developers are pretty good

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,480
about like knowing that the things that

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,000
they're using in their top level

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,200
dependencies

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,559
are like are kosher with you know

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,359
kosher with within kind of uh microsoft

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,880
policies

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,920
it's these sub dependencies that they

00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,200
won't even look at this undiscoverable

00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,400
um you know non-kosher thing living in

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,040
the pickle jar

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,480
that you want to that you want to um

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,119
think about so i want to talk a little

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,680
bit about

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,800
how we deal with those and and sorry

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,520
those those non-closure things are

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,440
basically

00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,160
unexpected copy left or unexpected

00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,640
proprietary

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,400
components are are really all that you

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,440
need to be concerned about

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,280
if you've automated the um

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,960
the attribution process which we have

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,079
and i'll describe that in a minute as

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,119
well

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,240
so um the way that the way that we've

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,520
been doing this we've actually stood up

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,079
an open source

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,079
project or i guess i guess you could

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,760
call a product called clearly defined

00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,359
it's really it's kind of an open source

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,839
service that can be mirrored

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,680
in various locations and what clearly

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,720
defined does it takes every open source

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,359
component

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,760
that we can find like everything and you

00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,559
know

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,760
amazon and google and microsoft and this

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,440
is all through the open source

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,000
initiative they all donated

00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,520
compute time to doing this so it's a

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,520
massive effort

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,720
harvest all the open source components

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:07,920
in all the different places npm new get

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,480
maven etc we run

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,319
open source license tools over them to

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,640
discover the different licenses that we

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,640
have

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,240
those tools we agree and as a community

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,359
those tools are pretty good at

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,200
identifying

00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,960
you know certain licenses and if they

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,000
come back with a with a high level of

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,440
accuracy

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,680
then we say okay that's really the

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,559
license that we've we've discovered for

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,920
the

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,200
component if we if there's something

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,400
called no assertion if it

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,160
comes back without it says like hey this

00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,800
looks like a license i don't know what

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,000
the license

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,040
is um can someone look

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,079
at it if if we or somebody else

00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,559
you know sees that we will

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,960
um look at the license itself and either

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,800
curate it as an open source license

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,400
and say like hey like we agree as a

00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,839
community like more than one person

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,599
needs to agree we make a pull request

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,240
against the database

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:09,119
what is that um what is that license

00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,760
we all agree this is what it is and then

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,520
we

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,200
uh we put that in the database and then

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,160
we send some feedback

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,119
to the project saying like hey you know

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,599
you're not

00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,200
we're trying to use your software we

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,000
think it's under this license but it's

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,400
unclear

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,079
could you help us um could you help us

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,040
figure out what license your project's

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,440
really under

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,720
because at the end of the day licenses

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,440
are just permission

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,920
um if the author of the project doesn't

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,920
know what

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,079
what what we need to do in order to use

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,559
the software then how are we gonna know

00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:43,119
and so that's all about you know how we

00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,200
how we think about that

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,040
um and and our notice files are actually

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,559
built off of clearly defined and the

00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,000
license information

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:54,960
that's all available publicly as part of

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,559
that um

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,000
as part of that database so i'd invite

00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,359
you to check it out it's clearly defined

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,319
dot io

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,680
um there are there's documentation and

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,319
interfaces to it

00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,200
for those of us who kind of work on in

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,160
off pose or

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,040
in tooling organizations um so that you

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,960
can query it

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,400
and you know it'll return the relevant

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,240
license information for

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,079
for for the list of packages that you

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,599
send it

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,559
so you know this is inside of our

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,319
component governance system um

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,240
so you know we have the list of packages

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,240
we've auto detected most of them you

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,440
know others have been manually input

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,200
and we click you know notice configure

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,480
it let's you know what are we shipping

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,040
some things have um

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,480
you know dev dependencies or whatnot and

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,400
then you just click download and you get

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,319
a notice file on our form

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,319
and and everything and everything works

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,319
together

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,680
i just want to flash really quickly this

00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,599
isn't what microsoft use we

00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,119
we have a combination of proprietary and

00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,920
open source solution there's a tooling

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,400
group

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,240
through the open chain group that is

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,160
trying to put together

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,000
or at least build the interfaces between

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,319
a bunch of open source tools

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,160
to think about how you build a kind of

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,720
fully open source ci cd

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,480
infrastructure and the way that this

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,040
essentially works and this is you know

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,040
we we

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,559
we have an almost all the way solution

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,640
there microsoft

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,319
is you know you got to discover what you

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,319
have right so you

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,520
you know dependency resolver like what's

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,559
in the container

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,240
what's in the binaries you got to go get

00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,800
all the source that you need and like

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,240
analyze what the licenses are

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,240
you figure out how your program is

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,240
building those things

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,440
and then you you know figure out what

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,839
the policies are for this organization

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,280
and then you need to you know produce

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:45,040
the compliance artifacts

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,720
which you know right now um i think

00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,720
best tooling i've seen can produce

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,960
notice files that's what we have

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,119
um down the road you could imagine

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,760
situations where the source code is spit

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,839
out

00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,280
um the the source code fulfilling all

00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,240
obligation is spin out along with that

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,040
license file

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,599
and archive somewhere for anybody to to

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,119
reach

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,960
and so that's that's kind of the holy

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,000
grail that this kind of cross

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,520
company team um being led by

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,880
um a man um named out of siemens

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:17,839
um has been has been working on um

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,040
in the open chain community so i'd like

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,839
to spend uh

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,440
the last five minutes or so talking a

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,200
little bit about how we think about

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,720
counseling around contributing and

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,520
releasing um

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,800
the first question that i asked or one

00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,319
of the first questions in the use case

00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,800
is like what are we defending against

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,040
i think it's really easy to kind of grok

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,520
that for everybody in the use case right

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,480
it's

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,319
it's unknown obligations creeping in and

00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,960
therefore you know us not being able to

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,880
fill them

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,240
fulfill them because they're unknown or

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,000
kind of unwanted

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,599
um so that's that's that's the first

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,119
question you'd be asking yourself

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,280
in all of these situations when you're

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,800
thinking about scale right because it's

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,559
easy to say no

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,079
um but if you see but if you say no

00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,839
without a reason then you're just being

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,480
needlessly blocking as a lawyer and

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,280
and that's you know something that a lot

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,280
of lawyers

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,040
uh get a lot of flack for and something

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,680
that i you know i try to

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,800
try to not have happen in my practice so

00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,559
what are you defending against and

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,240
contributing release and so

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:20,720
i i think the answer to this question

00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:24,079
is essentially unwanted leakage

00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,079
of patent or copyrights or trade

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,079
secrets that like we think are super

00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,119
valuable for our team

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,240
okay great so let's balance that against

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,079
a few different things

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:39,839
right um one is kind of the hr thing

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,680
a lot of developers want to be able to

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,559
engage with open source communities in

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,319
various ways

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,720
either part is part of their job or kind

00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:49,920
of outside their outside their job

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,400
so you know that unwanted leakage like

00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,680
how much are you willing to how much are

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,520
you willing to block

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,200
right um do we care

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,640
if someone's like you know writing a

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,079
sorting library which is

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,920
very unlikely to have ip which is kind

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,520
of like you know utilities and that kind

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,520
of thing

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,880
programming languages does if your

00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,920
company's not

00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,760
a you know compiler company you know do

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,480
you care if you work

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,480
um can you greenfield for your

00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,319
developers compilers

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,000
this is harder for microsoft because we

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,200
write all the software

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,520
all the different types of stuff we're

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,680
in everything for practically everything

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,520
um but you know if you're not then maybe

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,079
you greenfield a bunch of things

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,240
um compiler technology that's not that

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,480
exciting anymore

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,400
you know maybe maybe you can consider

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,720
greenfield in that

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,880
um and you know there's a development

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,000
cost to not contributing back in lots of

00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,680
situations

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,680
cost of forking or maintenance of the

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,079
code if there are other people who are

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,240
interested

00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,160
in this a solution that you've you know

00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,200
grown a custom

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,200
custom solution maybe releasing it

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,440
and and collaborating in the open with

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,400
those folks would would lower your cost

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,839
development cost

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,400
to a significant advantage that

00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,760
outweighs the kind of trade secret ip

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,960
risk that you

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,640
um that you're entailing and

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,240
i'd say the kind of last like

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,319
consideration is

00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,240
if you're using a oh and there's also a

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,599
cost of maintaining a fork so

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,119
you know if there's a if there's an open

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,799
source project you really like but

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,520
you're really concerned about

00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,920
kind of ip around that what's the what's

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,920
the

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,920
what's the engineering cost of

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,319
maintaining that fork as that

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,119
as you know you make a fork the program

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,960
progresses

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,400
continuing integration with that fork

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,200
can be really difficult

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,119
and so you know is the cost worth you

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,480
know what what you're defending against

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,760
um at the outset and then

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,839
you know being comfortable with um

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,760
you know things like you know community

00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,359
norms around how to contribute

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,040
you know some people have you know

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,839
contributed to license agreements that

00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,880
assign

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:59,680
you know or sorry the grant patent

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:03,040
rights or or copyrights in the code

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,799
or broad licenses to them at least

00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,720
whereas others just say like you know we

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,359
we have the ability to put this under

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,040
an open source license you know are you

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,079
comfortable or can you get comfortable

00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,480
with all those different

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,000
communities and if you're if you can't

00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,119
get comfortable

00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,040
um and and so many others have you know

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,680
is that needlessly blocking for

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,400
for the company and so those are really

00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,920
i

00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,760
you know these are kind of the tenants

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,400
that i that i'd weigh

00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,079
as i'm as i'm thinking about you know

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,760
contribution and release guides like how

00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,160
do we do it at scale i will say like the

00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,559
small

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,280
code exception is something that was met

00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:43,359
with a lot of celebration at microsoft

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,079
because um microsoft you know we used to

00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,160
just kind of

00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,599
review every contribution that went

00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,440
anywhere and so

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,760
people would just either not follow our

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,520
policies because they were too onerous

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,960
could take a long time to do a kind of a

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,760
small bug fix

00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,280
or um or they just wouldn't do it which

00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,640
isn't what we want either because of you

00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,920
know like i said the cost of maintaining

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,000
a fork or whatever

00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,000
so so you know accepting something

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,720
that's unlikely to have

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,839
a lot of valuable you know value to the

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,400
company there's a patent or trade secret

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,359
um because it's you know a few lines of

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,160
code

00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:19,200
um from the overall process it might be

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,520
something that

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,319
is is kind of worth considering and it

00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,000
also kind of unblocks a large amount of

00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,559
the open source engagement that people

00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,240
want to

00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,240
engage in they want to scratch their own

00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,960
niche this isn't working properly

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,319
like let me fix it like i need to use

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,040
this component

00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,599
but you know but the components there's

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,520
a bug

00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,280
like i need to fix it so that i can you

00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,680
know unblock myself to build this you

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,559
know

00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,880
larger thing that i'm working on um you

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,480
know

00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,400
giving that level of unblocking is

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,480
actually quite um quite useful for

00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,200
developers and i think um

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,920
you know they really appreciate it

00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,920
questions on this

00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,680
how do you how do you communicate the

00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,400
sort of ex

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,440
the scope of the small code exception to

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,760
developers

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,480
what's what's small yeah you know maybe

00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,559
i should

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,400
it's fine uh you know small can be under

00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,119
a certain number of lines is typically

00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,440
what we do

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,720
or and and and you can do it in in two

00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,760
different ways you can say like

00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,799
not significant functionality or

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,440
or and a small number of lines and you

00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,119
know i think

00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,440
you know a lot of developers will will

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,319
come back to me a bit pedantically

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,359
saying

00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:31,599
okay you know this uh you know

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,480
what is not significant functionality

00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,040
meaning i'm like you know what

00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,559
significant functionality

00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,400
you know like i can't tell you what

00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,559
significant functionality means

00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,079
in in in the particular instance that

00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,960
you're making the contribution but you

00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,400
know

00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,920
and they usually do it's fuzzy but

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,920
that fuzziness kind of helps i think

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,240
um one other thing i'd say is like you

00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,960
know inside of microsoft i i pointed you

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,359
at google's

00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,839
doc site like the public version if you

00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,079
do i think it's

00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:02,000
docs.opensource.google.com

01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,359
or something like that if you google

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,880
open source docs google

01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,799
you know we have an internal

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,040
documentation say we're thinking about

01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:10,480
you know trying to to scrub for pub for

01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,119
you know it's kind of low on the list

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,680
but

01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,880
um you know scrub for you know to get

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,480
our policies and

01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,319
thought processes out there to the

01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,359
extent that that we can and they're not

01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:22,880
privileged

01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:24,880
um you know throughout the company um

01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,799
it's really helpful to have a central

01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,079
location if you're going to scale your

01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,720
advice to write down

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,520
your advice in like checklist form for

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,480
folks to

01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,760
be able to look at and and learn from

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,880
and so that's something if you're if

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,599
you're thinking about doing this inside

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,359
a company

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,880
having a central location for that is

01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,960
critical um

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,319
and and it helps answer a lot you don't

01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,359
know how you know how many questions i

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,280
answer by saying

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,359
follow the guidance here and i just send

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,440
them to the to our doc site

01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,119
yeah all right well we're at the end of

01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,640
the hour so um i want to

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,640
you know if if you have a couple of

01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,079
minutes and want to answer a couple more

01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,440
questions then you're welcome to but i

01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,839
just wanted to go ahead and wrap

01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,839
up and say thank you so much justin for

01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,680
this incredibly informative talk

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,880
um i'm sure the folks got a lot out of

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,359
it

01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,440
we'd love to have you or or others at

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:14,640
microsoft back sometime

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,240
um and yeah thanks thanks for uh

01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,920
donating a little bit of your time to

01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,000
the cost yeah no

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,000
no problem at all and very happy to and

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,520
i i do have five minutes if folks want

01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,200
to stay around i'm sorry i ran right up

01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,119
against time

01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,960
i thought i thought i was golden and

01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,520
then i guess the last five minutes got

01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,520
away from me

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,799
any other questions for justin for those

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,040
who have a couple minutes to stick

01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,040
around

01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,400
i just made an observation in the chat

01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,240
aaron that

01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,520
you know i think justin's guidance

01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,319
around

01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,680
relying on developers a little bit to

01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:51,200
assess and attest

01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:53,680
the i guess the materiality of code is

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,480
important because i think the the old

01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,920
adage of

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,160
sort of or not the old edge but like

01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,839
sort of the default assumption of well

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,720
how many lines of code

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,440
doesn't always hold because in a world

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,520
of

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,359
you know going back a long ways to pearl

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,280
but more recently to the

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,880
to the increasing popularity of

01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,039
functional programming

01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,160
you know a couple lines of haskell can

01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,559
do what

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,079
20 or 30 lines of java code can do and

01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,160
so now you have

01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,359
a couple lines of code that in fact can

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,160
pack a

01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,000
really large algorithmic punch um and in

01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,200
fact could be quite material in terms of

01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,680
what they're doing

01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,599
um so it's that all the more reason you

01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,039
have to use a little bit of discretion

01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,039
rather than just say well it's just one

01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,119
line of code where one line of ocam or

01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,200
haskell could actually do a ton

01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,960
absolutely and any language that does

01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,720
not have significant white space like

01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,200
python you could cram a whole lot into

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,200
one line

01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,550
i'm sure the developer has tried to game

01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,079
that system before

01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:54,400
[Laughter]

01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,280
that's a good way to get fired right

01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,799
exactly

01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,720
that's that's the point right like you

01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:01,119
know but putting it on them and

01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,960
and you know having the attestation you

01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,400
know yeah you know it's it's not

01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,960
you know i don't consider this to be

01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,280
materially functional but if it in fact

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,000
it clearly was and that's a you know

01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,640
that's

01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,640
that's an issue

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,119
we'll go ahead and unmute the rest so

01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,119
that

01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,359
he is having trouble getting a question

01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:30,319
and they have the opportunity

01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:33,280
questions for justin

01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:35,520
and we will we will call it thanks a lot

01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:45,839
justin

01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:45,839
great great to be here thanks everybody

01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,530
