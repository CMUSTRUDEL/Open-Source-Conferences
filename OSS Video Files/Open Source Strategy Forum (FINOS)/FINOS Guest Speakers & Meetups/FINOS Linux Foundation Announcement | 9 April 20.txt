[Music]

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,840
2018 was our first year

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,680
full year as pinos we have started

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,039
delivering uh usable

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,480
standards like fdc3 uh code

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,520
like perspective uh and and really

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
seeing banks uh stepping up and

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,440
contributing code you know the

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,200
the alloy announcement the pure alloy

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,480
contribution from goldman

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
made massive news last year and again

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,960
it's not about the news

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,399
we now have an ongoing uh

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,879
pilot with several banks and so again

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
i look back three or four years ago our

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,079
community was

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
really vendor-centric in terms of the

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,840
active contributors and our chief goal

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,039
was to

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,799
have banks ready from a policy and a

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,680
sort of business understanding of open

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
source

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,240
to actively contribute and being able to

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,200
yield the benefits of

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
open source contribution uh i think by

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
and large we are there there's so much

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,479
more to do but

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
again in 2019 was was an amazing year

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,479
for us

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,159
and 2020 has started again a couple of

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,000
couple of uh uh screenshots here around

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
both the press coverage that we had on

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
on alloy

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,360
as well as as i was saying this is real

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,040
uh as we're not you know

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
we're still working on the final

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
contribution of the code but we do have

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
an environment

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that is hosted in venus several banks

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,439
are collaborating already

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
and other members are collaborating

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,000
already on really building common models

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,479
on this platform which is

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
exactly the goal that we want to achieve

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,040
so

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
very excited again this is not just

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,000
marketing i just wanted to show that

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,079
this is again

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
tangible progress that we're making and

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,560
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
has started on the same note as much as

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
you'll see

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
of course we've been a little busy uh

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,440
working on this

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
this important opportunity with the

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,959
linux foundation we still have signed

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
new banks new

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,319
uh uh silver members

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,720
like adaptive and genesis so i want to

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,120
send a shout out to our new members

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,200
but again as far as project goes we have

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
an ongoing pilot in alloy

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,440
deutsche bank has just contributed a

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,000
really interesting project called walls

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,599
if you haven't seen it go check it out

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,599
very mature

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
open source projects that is gus already

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,879
multiple financial institutions

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,760
and we have city almost completing the

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,599
first

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,720
major contribution to the foundation so

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,920
again as a testament of

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,680
we are getting the industry we have made

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,120
massive inroads over the last two years

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
in getting the industry ready to

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
contribute

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:03,440
uh uh and collaborate in the open

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,760
now as we started the year uh we

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,000
you know we're a relatively small team

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
uh

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
you know more than 100 projects in in a

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
team of less than 10

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,440
with certainly a community that is still

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
uh i wouldn't say high maintenance but

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,040
certainly

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
requires you know in the curve of open

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,519
source maturity in terms of

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,120
self-sufficiency

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
there's certainly a lot that the finance

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,080
team still does

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,920
and helps in uh sort of

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
gaining momentum and velocity in our

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,560
projects and so

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,159
with the board we face the question of

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,799
how do we you know uh of course

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,519
harvest this growth that we've seeded in

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
2019 but how do we make this sustainable

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
long term

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,560
and bear in mind that this question came

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,680
up much earlier than

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,439
the the obviously very particular

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,879
situation that worldwide situation that

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
we're living right now

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,560
which i think it makes even more

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
important

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,799
to have you know

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,519
really deep consideration as to how we

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,599
make this sustainable long term

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,280
and so as we explored several options

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
late last year in the beginning of this

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
year

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,040
it's become clear that the

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
most you know appealing and honestly

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
exciting option

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,080
for us moving forward will be to

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,479
join the linux foundation and become

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,840
part of a

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,080
you know what i call an open source

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
powerhouse the linux foundation really

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
hosts

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
the biggest shared technology investment

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
that is out there

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,800
and has proven over and over again that

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
uh you know has played really unique

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
role in bringing

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
the sort of corporate open source if you

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
want

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,800
to the mainstream i mean many

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,600
projects and and really markets

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
that we know nowadays wouldn't exist

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
without

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,479
some of the ecosystems that were built

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,160
over the last 10 to 20 years

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
by the linux foundation you know

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,039
deliverance kernel itself of course

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,199
kubernetes many of you should be

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,240
familiar with hyper ledger so

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,400
it it became more and more clear in the

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,080
conversation with our board and with jim

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,800
and the team at the linux foundation

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
that there was a lot of synergy

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
and one that would help you know both

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,479
sides

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,800
to to grow uh even faster

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,160
in the financial services the notion of

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
open source collaboration

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
in the financial services industry so

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
i'm really excited and

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,800
i think the whole team is uh as well

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,600
i hope uh uh um that

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,639
we we now are part of a you know bigger

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
organization

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,680
uh mature from a infrastructure

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,759
standpoint and so many other

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
aspects that we'll talk through during

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,240
this presentation

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,680
down there you see the link to the press

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
release

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
you're gonna hear me asking you making

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,639
to make noise

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
about this today of course this has been

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,240
a fully digital announcement

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,720
given the uh kovite 19

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,600
crisis and so it's even the more

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,919
important

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
that each one of you chimes in and helps

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,639
us really celebrate

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,400
this accomplishment so

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
i'm going to give you a quick overview

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,560
of what that means for finnos

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,039
and then we're going to go into a bit

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,479
more detail of what the opportunity is

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,680
for you as a community

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,600
you know on high level i want to say

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,000
as far as the overall direction of the

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,120
foundation and

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,400
your sort of day-by-day community facing

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,160
operations

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,720
uh those will largely remain the same so

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
uh i think that's important to again

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
stress the fact that

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,280
we will continue focusing on financial

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
services we will continue focusing on

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,800
financial service contributors and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,120
consumers as well as

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
solving this industry-wide business

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,400
challenges

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,800
as well as you know the team the finos

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,160
team on the day by day

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,120
will still remain the same so

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,000
uh i wanted to sort of lead with that

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,560
because

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,319
i think it's important to provide

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,599
continuity we obviously went through

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
a pretty large expansion and rebranding

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,000
two years

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
ago and so i wanted to make sure that

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,720
everyone understands that our day by day

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
operation

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,759
will largely remain the same um

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,080
what's probably gonna happen in the back

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,880
end is really that phenos will be set up

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,680
as a director

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,879
from under the linux foundation uh very

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
much governed

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,199
again with uh with basically mapped our

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,319
current governance

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,720
into uh uh you know the

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,560
governing documents that manage directed

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
funds under the linux foundation

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
again as i have a slide in the next

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,520
slide that jim

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
uh you know would provide an

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,720
introduction to the linux foundation but

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,960
if you guys are not familiar

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
uh with dlf yes

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,759
several other foundations and several

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,599
other open source collaborative efforts

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,199
again hyper ledger cloud native

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,520
computing foundation

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,639
uh openjs um you know you name it i

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
i i would i would not make justice to

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,639
the linux foundation

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
uh as much as jim could so i will i will

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,880
let him

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,360
comment uh on that in the next slide but

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,959
basically phoenix will become the

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,159
financial services

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,760
focus foundation under the umbrella

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,440
under the broader umbrella of the linux

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,240
foundation

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,080
um as far as the governance i have a

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
slide later on but generally we are

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,120
keeping the governance very much

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,720
similar to what we have been operating

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,440
under over the last four years um

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
we as those of you are more engaged in

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
the community know that we've been

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
looking anyway

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
at changing some of the program

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,720
governance and so there might be

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
improvements that come

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
there we'll talk about it have a slide

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,360
on that

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,519
but largely you can expect the

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
governance the current license

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,720
and the current you know cla process to

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
to

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,760
largely remain the same what

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,200
we will be able to benefit from uh as we

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,959
move forward with the transition and

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
this is gonna take of course a few

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,440
months

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,720
but the lf comes with a really strong

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
sort of back office support

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
infrastructure as well as sort of front

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
office

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,160
project support services of course i

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
think many of you would agree that

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
a big value that phoenix has provided to

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,839
its community is really the open

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,680
developer platform and the

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
compliance tooling infrastructure that

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
we make available

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,560
for our projects we now have the

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,000
opportunity to enhance that even more

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,320
leveraging again a battle tested

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
infrastructure that dlf has been using

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
across so many industries and so many

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
projects

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
over the last 10 years um as far as

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
members go

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
famous members must become left members

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,959
you've seen a couple outside that

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
there's already

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,000
a lot of overlap again this might not be

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,480
as

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,079
important for community leaders but it

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,240
certainly

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
was a factor for us to make sure that we

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,880
would retain and even

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,360
increase uh uh the funding to be able to

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,640
accelerate all of our operations

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,160
uh and finally the phoenix board is not

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,079
going to be a board of directors and

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,959
that we call the governing board but

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,800
largely will retain autonomy on the

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,160
direction and the funding

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,279
of of the thinness directed fund so

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,040
again overall uh we will make sure the

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,800
transition is as smooth

00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:01,519
as possible for our community

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,839
and we expect really to be able to uh

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,920
use the support of the linux foundation

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
in the back end to be able to focus even

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,240
more on

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,760
strategic business challenges that we

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,600
want to solve through open source in

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,640
this industry

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,959
and with that i would like to ask jim

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,760
to give us an introduction on dlf and

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,880
some of the support services that they

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,519
provide

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,079
absolutely thanks gavin we're we want to

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
welcome

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,959
everybody from the finnos community to

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,040
the linux foundation community although

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,399
i suspect that many of you are already

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,640
participating

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,079
in a lot of the different projects that

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,440
we host

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,640
um you know we we think that uh

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,839
if anything gab and uh your whole team's

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,920
market time in here

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:57,600
is impeccable um we certainly are in a

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,160
a period where working together

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
uh in the face of a large global

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,920
challenge is something that

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,920
we're all going to have to do and you

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,200
know before i jump into

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,079
the things that we're going to be able

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,079
to provide the finance community

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
i want to be clear on our priorities in

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,399
in this crisis

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,040
um you know the linux foundation and all

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,160
of our

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,480
uh sub uh organizations want to

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,399
preserve the safety and health of our uh

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,360
staff and community um

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,839
our number one goal after that is to

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
maintain

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,880
employment for all our entire teams uh

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
despite the fact that uh we've

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,200
definitely taken a hit

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,480
with the crisis we're retraining our

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
event staff to work

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
through things that will actually uh

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
benefit a lot of the

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
finals projects um and we're very

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,920
committed to that

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
uh we'll also be rolling out some

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,240
additional uh

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,240
training and mentoring opportunities uh

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,200
in order to assist folks who have been

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
impacted

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,120
uh from a job perspective um during this

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,760
crisis so

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,519
stay tuned for more of that i think one

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,920
of the things that

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,000
makes this partnership so good is the

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,760
fact that our organization is going to

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,680
be able to extend

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
a lot of the the things that we do for

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
our projects to

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,320
you know do what we like to describe as

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
being the best

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,880
upstream for a vibrant commercial

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,440
downstream and to be a great upstream

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,639
uh and to facilitate these amazing

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,079
projects whether it's

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
linux kubernetes on the front end things

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,160
like electron

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,360
and node.js um

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,560
make sure that those projects have

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,720
uh good places to convene uh

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,040
last year we convened over 50 000

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
developers across all of our events

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
we want to make sure that the

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,000
intellectual property provenance

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,240
is clear and reliable we have a variety

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
of

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,320
tools from tools like spdx which

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,760
tracks software bill of materials across

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
the supply chain

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,000
to our easy cla tools which automate the

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,320
ability to

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
sign licensing agreements and commit

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,399
that you've

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,199
uh i've been adhering to all of the ip

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,240
rights for the

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,959
the code that you're submitting and so

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,160
forth

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,279
uh we have an amazing training platform

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,160
that uh teaches folks from the basics of

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,240
open source

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,600
all the way down into deep kernel

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,079
internals or

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,279
to become a kubernetes certified

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,480
administrator

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,199
our training platforms register over 500

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,880
people

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,600
every single day who are learning about

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,399
open source learning about our different

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
projects

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
and the finnos community will be able to

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,680
take advantage of that large platform

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,000
to teach your community and train folks

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
to take advantage of the projects in

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,680
this ecosystem

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,240
we have a variety of certification and

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,120
testing programs for

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,560
interoperability for skills

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,800
certification

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,320
uh we have an entire entity that

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,199
promotes our projects

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
you know one of the things that uh

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,639
counter-intuitive

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,839
open source is that you know uh

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,600
marketing actually turns out to be

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,560
important bring

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,160
more developers and interests into these

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,240
communities so we can get

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,240
more code downstream implementation to

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,199
produce better outcomes

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,560
uh gab already mentioned we have a solid

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,839
infrastructure here

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,279
to uh help improve uh

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,000
the development and release process for

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,560
all of our projects we've been uh

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,639
working

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:46,320
uh over the all of our projects to

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,120
modern cicd pipelines and uh modern

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,240
tooling

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
uh modern testing uh in order to improve

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,800
the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
outcomes of those projects and i think

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,440
finally and i think this is

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,639
important for everyone is we want to

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
make sure that

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,399
the projects that we host at the

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
foundation which are the ones that are

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,160
the most important to society that run

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,360
most of the systems that we all use

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,639
every day

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,680
that those projects are secure that they

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,519
have

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,440
really good application security

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,440
practices that there's a responsible

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,079
disclosure process that

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,800
uh those projects are regularly uh

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,560
audited

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,399
and reviewed for security

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,759
vulnerabilities we're

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,800
rolling out new tools that provide uh

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,560
deep analysis and continuous code

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,759
scanning so that we can make sure that

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,279
our projects

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,360
uh are reliable and secure

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
so all of those things will be uh

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
extended over the coming months to this

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,519
community and we look

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,759
forward to uh working with gab uh

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,079
his entire team and all of you in the

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,079
thinness community

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,360
well thank you so much jim that's that's

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,120
really exciting and i think

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,959
i fully agree with you especially you

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
know the ap compliance and application

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,279
security have been

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
you know paramount you know for any open

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
source community but i think

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
particularly

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,520
for you know regulated industries so

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,559
really looking forward i'm already you

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
know eyeing

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,919
a couple of components there that i

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,039
think have been

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,439
uh missing and of course folks uh

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,039
please feel free you know especially in

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,720
the open developer platform working

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,919
group but in general feel free to reach

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,319
out i know

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
uh you know we've always continued to

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,679
improve our infrastructure but i know

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
that there's much more to do especially

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,799
to make it fully accessible

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,640
for banks and so

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,919
definitely very much keen to hear your

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
thoughts on

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,120
how we move forward with it thank you

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
jim

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,880
and going to the next slide uh it's a

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
bit of an eye chart but i i'm not going

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
to

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,559
uh read through

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
but i just wanted to break down sort of

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,080
mapping what jim mentioned

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,240
into you know what is the value for

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,320
finesse and the opportunity for the

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,960
community in joining forces

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,280
um you know i'll start really from the

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,000
middle from projects here

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,799
ultimately this is what we do our value

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,840
is

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,080
primarily producing you know

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,080
vibrant projects that deliver releases

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,360
that solve problems in the industry

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,880
and i think we have a massive

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
opportunity both in terms of new

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
projects

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,559
again becoming the financial services

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,919
umbrella of a much

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,320
broader foundation uh will generate and

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,679
have already been exposed to several

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,320
really interesting opportunities uh

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,120
you know that we wouldn't have uncovered

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,320
uh or

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,240
the you know where under the sphere of

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,559
the linux foundation

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,520
that we could actually become the

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,000
steward for

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,640
and so um you'll see later in the

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,799
timeline

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,559
our hope is to be able to announce some

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
very exciting new projects over the next

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,679
couple of months

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,919
we have so much opportunity across the

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,640
whole financial services industry

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,600
uh even as we look beyond uh capital

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,520
markets

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,120
so a lot uh more to come there

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,039
uh and i think that's that's gonna be a

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,640
huge opportunity for us but even for

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,440
existing projects

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,880
um i wanna call out a couple of things

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,679
here one

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,559
of course existing projects will you

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,520
know garner broader visibility dlf has

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,320
a pretty impressive reach as as we

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,919
discussed above

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,120
but to the point of upstream that jim

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,400
so uh properly made

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,440
you know several other projects

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,799
depend on components like electron

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,720
or node.js for example so i see that a

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,960
really major opportunity

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,880
for our community to more closely

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
collaborate with upstream

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,160
and being able to again under harmonize

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
governance at this point across penis

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,039
and the linux function

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,159
you're really able to uh

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,120
you know make sure that what needs to be

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
upstream

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,840
should be upstream and what is specific

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,400
to financial services stays in finland

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,720
so it creates a really nice

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,720
i think prospect for everyone working on

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,480
you know components that are downstream

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,880
to electron downstream to node

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
you know our cloud service certification

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
uh uh

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,039
you know how it relates to kubernetes

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,480
and the cloud native computing

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,679
foundation and you know even hyper

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,360
ledger

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
and our blockchain efforts of course

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,559
will be

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,600
will be able to work much closer with

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,640
each other

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,000
um as far as member goes um

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:52,720
glf has and jim correct me if i'm wrong

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,840
here but has hundreds of members that

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,280
will be looking to engage uh

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,400
um 200 1600 okay so i kept it

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,520
conservative there

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,080
over 1500 uh at least correct

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
but uh there's there's an opportunity to

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,799
really engage

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,520
um beyond the current community other

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,320
financial service institutions

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,440
big vendors that are already part of the

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,280
linux foundation

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,480
our cloud service providers have been a

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,360
big goal for us to engage further

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,960
um and so that's that's really a

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
potential opportunity for growth of our

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,200
funding and

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,799
you know that turns into more uh

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
you know being a steam and more

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,720
activities that we can do to

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,760
mentor the projects to coach the project

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,080
or even fund our projects

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,679
on the flip side as i said many of our

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,960
members as you actually see

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,200
in two slides ahead

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
jump quickly most of our members are

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,799
already members of the linux foundation

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
that only that doesn't only mean that we

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,080
would

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,960
you know very candidly have less

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,280
competition

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,559
on potential you know budget

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
that is dedicated to open source

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,159
foundations but also as you know

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,919
this is a very time intensive uh

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,440
industry and so even being able to

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,640
uh uh you know focus the

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,720
uh uh attention of you know especially

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,360
our institutional members

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,320
uh it is gonna be very important as we

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,520
you know

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,720
live in a very uh uh um

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,799
you know attention hungry uh

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,559
uh world i think it's gonna be really

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
important to be able to find synergies

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,240
within the banks

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,240
of projects around across the venus

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,320
finally as far as as community goes um

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
you know we this way we reduce

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,159
fragmentation

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,080
we allow the community to become really

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
part of a much broader community and so

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,440
i see a lot of potential for

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,000
cross-pollination there

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,520
again if we plot this community sort of

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,520
in the curve of maturity

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,200
i think there's still a lot that we can

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
learn as a community on how we

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640
collaborate

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,720
and build a successful open source

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,760
project in a self-sustained way

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,520
and again dlf has a track record and

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,799
certainly a

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,679
very large uh uh you know base of

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,720
contributors that can bring

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,039
additional support to our projects and

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,240
then jim touched on the supporting

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,480
services

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,240
just to put it in context we now have

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,799
several projects that could use

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
certification could use training and it

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,120
probably would have taken us

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,880
you know months if not years to set up a

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,720
program like that and so right now we'll

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
have the chance to spin up

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
you know quickly training and

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,279
certification uh

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,799
um you know programs so please feel free

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,679
to reach out on that it's something that

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,679
actually rob

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,840
underwood will be leading from from our

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,840
side so if you have any interest there

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,919
this is this is a really good time to

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,240
get those conversations started

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,240
uh dlf hosts the open source summit

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
cubic on like tens of thousands of

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,120
people

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,240
per event um the lf will be

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,360
you know once we go back to uh

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,799
the new normal after this crisis dlf

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,440
will be

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,559
uh helping us organize the open source

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,679
strategy forum

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,360
will be consolidating uh our respective

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,799
events into one again

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,240
big potential for uh bigger better

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,919
events and then finally i want to touch

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,440
on open source readiness

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,799
um you know we know that this industry

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
requires

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,000
a special attention when it comes uh to

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
become sort of

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,840
open source ready from a policy

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,000
technology and sort of business

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,799
standpoint

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
but the lf has several uh initiatives

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,840
like the to do group

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:57,039
open chain act that really

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,200
work for the same goal and so i can see

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,120
that a lot of potential consolidation

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,039
or in terms of just in terms of material

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,240
but thought leadership and really

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,520
how effective we can be in quickly

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,120
moving the needle

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,320
in in banks being able to contribute

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,360
um i'm going to quickly touch on

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,880
projects

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,840
um we created a new slide here

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,520
uh that plots our key projects again

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,840
this is just a sample list but

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,440
we're starting again in the spirit of

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,440
more and more focusing on solving

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,520
business challenges we now have

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,200
a map of how our projects fit

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,799
into you know a potential

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,120
financial service institution

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,640
business organization or or set of use

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,559
cases and workflow

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,480
um and i just wanted to call out

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,919
explicitly that of course

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,520
you know uh these projects that

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,240
the linux foundation is hosting and

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,240
again i picked only four here

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
they are already open source and you

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
know you could

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,240
have used it and probably you're using

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,760
it already uh using those already but

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,039
as we come together i see that a major

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,679
opportunity for

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:16,640
again a better upstream collaboration

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,720
again we have several implementations

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,080
based on electron on node

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,080
i really do hope that we can

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,240
again make sure that what what needs to

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,200
flow upstream can go upstream and i will

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
be happy to

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
entertain again these conversations

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,159
about synergy

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,919
across projects under the linux

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
foundation so

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,120
really really exciting opportunities i

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,440
think and i would love for you folks to

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,960
you know take time to go and browse the

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,640
projects of the linux foundation

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,000
you know feedback to us which areas of

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,640
potential you see there for

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,440
collaboration

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,559
um we talked about the members i'm not

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
going to go through that list on the

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,760
right but as you can see

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
there's a really good potential for us

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,919
to to grow the support

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,159
of this community the monetary support

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,679
for this community which in turn

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,640
turns into more investments

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,200
um quick timeline here because i want to

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,120
make sure

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,559
we open up for questions as well um

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
of course we will share this slide and

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,960
publish these slides so

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,679
no need no need to take screenshots here

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,320
um

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,520
but we are now at the point of

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,000
announcement

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,360
um over the next few months what's gonna

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
happen is really

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,240
uh on the back end uh we are working

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,320
with our members to

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,679
execute a new participation agreement

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
under the

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,960
finance directed fund under the linux

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
foundation

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,520
and to clear something that i mentioned

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,840
we are not going to change brand

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,279
the final brand will remain the same you

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,760
know we went through people two years

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,399
ago

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,440
far from me to wanting to rebrand the

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,200
game

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,200
but yes there are some procedural steps

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,039
for our members to become members of the

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,320
new directed fund

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,520
and then the main goal would be

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,399
in a month or two as now we're public

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,600
to announce new members and new projects

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,520
that we're bringing

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,159
into finos lots more

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,600
to come there in the next month or two

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,480
and then finally

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,720
again this is very approximated but we

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,600
are going to more and more migrate our

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
infrastructure

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,279
back-end system to the linux foundation

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,440
fund as we do that

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,960
we'll end up winding down the existing

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,399
delaware corporation

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,559
that venus is currently operating out

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,559
there

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,600
um again i'm going to share these lights

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,399
i'm not going to spend too much time on

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,279
it but

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,399
we as i said we've had basically no

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,679
substantial

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,520
governance changes uh as we mapped

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:57,200
our governance into uh uh

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,240
the venus uh chapter uh uh directed fund

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,720
charter

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,640
um you can see here some minor changes

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
in terms of representation

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,760
uh we removed some procedural provisions

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,720
that

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,360
you know were required by us being a

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,960
corporation under delaware law

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,240
so again nothing substantial there i

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,039
really wanted to show this

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,159
just to say that again the governance

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,840
that

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:27,840
we put together will continue uh

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:31,600
you know largely as is and under the

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,159
uh oversight of the governing board

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,919
there is one addition that we're looking

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,200
to bring we have a board meeting in

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,840
about two weeks

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,559
um as you know we've been looking at

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,000
removing programs to really simplify

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,679
and streamline uh the way our community

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,480
uh sort of is governed moving

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,440
you know back to a centralized versus

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,679
federated

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,200
governance approach so we are putting

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,200
forward a

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,559
the idea of a technical advisory

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,000
committee uh

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,159
more as as

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,240
we put forward the proposal next week to

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,320
the membership and governance committee

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,360
and the week after to the board

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,360
but i think it's going to be really

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,880
important as a body to

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,880
really map between the business

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,760
challenges that the board identifies

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,159
and the open source projects that we do

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,559
have

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,399
in our portfolio but again all in all

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,559
very small changes in our governance i

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,320
wanted to make sure that that was

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:35,120
clear to everyone and with that

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:38,320
uh we have put together an faq page

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,640
i hope is the right link up there

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,640
just me

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,039
that is correct we have an faq which has

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,559
been circulated

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,720
answers what we think are the most

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,640
common question about this transaction

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,360
but i wanted to also open up right now

00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,760
to the this group to see if there are

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,880
any

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,880
specific questions

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,159
so feel free to unmute or post your

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,440
question in the chat

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,840
all right questions we'll assume silent

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
consent

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:33,840
i think everyone is muted so make sure

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:33,840
that you unmute yourself

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:44,720
okay five minutes left i i wanted to

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,279
just say um you know

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,840
this is a really big deal for us i think

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,600
for us

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,120
of course as a team we're very excited

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,960
but also for us

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,120
as a community um

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,720
you know four years ago we started

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,440
building a community

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,960
on a single platform symphony two years

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,159
ago we expanded

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,799
to uh you know a much more ambitious

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,880
charter

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,480
a mission to bring open source in

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
financial services as a first-class

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,840
citizen

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,880
i think today marks another fundamental

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,760
milestone for us

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,279
to continue growing and accelerating

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,640
what we're doing and i'm

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,720
you know absolutely excited i can't wait

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,799
uh you know we've been sitting on this

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,720
announcement for a month now

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,440
as the crisis unfolded but you know

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,120
it was it was due and we're really

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,000
excited to get started i hope

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,919
you folks are proud because i mean

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,159
without you we wouldn't have been

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,440
here so i want to send a shout out to

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,640
you and hopefully

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,000
champagne also because it's 9 48

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,279
in west coast but um uh

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,360
you know i'm italian we have a little

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,000
bit of a loser approach to that but

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,120
kidding aside as much as i cannot uh

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,480
share with you

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,960
uh in person uh my gratitude and

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,399
and sort of celebrate this i hope you'll

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,799
be able to

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,840
appreciate it this is a huge deal and i

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
don't know jim if you want to say a

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,840
couple of

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,600
couple of words on that no i i really

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,640
look forward to working with uh

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,600
all of you and you know quarantine rules

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,399
are um airport rules so you know we can
