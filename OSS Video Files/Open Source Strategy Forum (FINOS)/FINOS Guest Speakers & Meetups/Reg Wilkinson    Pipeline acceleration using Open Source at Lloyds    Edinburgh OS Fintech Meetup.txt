hi it's strange to be standing in front

00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,430
of an open source community as the evil

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,959
banker who primarily works on the

00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,969
mainframe so I will say mainframe quite

00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:19,650
a lot during the course of the next few

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,800
minutes if the kind of gods of live demo

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,509
stay with us we will do some a live

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,810
deployment of application based on open

00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:32,790
source so our front end uses react and

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,440
we've got a specialization called

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,890
constellation which even has its own

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,530
sticker and but also do some backend

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,390
changes on the mainframe on the system

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,250
of record at the same time so this is me

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,280
reg Wilkinson I'm a lead software

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,960
engineer which means I'm the kind of

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,390
carboard programmer for a bunch of

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,710
developers effectively so some there's a

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,269
problem they come and talk to me and

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,660
generally solve the problem themselves

00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:02,460
during the course of the conversation

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,440
what James says I'm also involved with a

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,270
lot of the central initiatives so we

00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,070
have a number of kind of centers of

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,160
excellence who will go out and support

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,760
teams with adoption of DevOps a doctrine

00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,830
of agile so making a tag line is that my

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,050
other part of my day job is to kind of

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,420
make things better for our engineers so

00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,100
as to take the the things our share from

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,020
the central team and from other teams in

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,760
the bank bring them back into our team

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,400
and see how we can adapt them for

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,710
ourselves which is kind of internal into

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,050
in our source model we have for software

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,520
and for collaboration and take things

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,160
that we've developed and take them out

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,760
and share them so for example we won

00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,790
roughly quarterly I see you as the face

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,830
to faces so we have a very active DevOps

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,100
community within the bank now and we all

00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,690
get together off sites we have a kind of

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,220
subset which looks after mainframe and

00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,350
we have a major kind of DevOps

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,060
advocates thing and the teams are

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,250
encouraged to come along and present

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,150
what they're working on and effectively

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,920
seek feedback no haven't seen Colin's

00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,080
presentation I couldn't let this go so

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,150
this is my claim to fame so this is when

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
I was at university which was a long

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,890
time ago so in 1986 me a couple

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,720
we knocked up a game and I said were on

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,560
the Commodore 16 and we did it for money

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,030
okay

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,210
the end of the day basically I went to

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,640
work for a bank and David went on to

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,800
work on grand theft auto and he walked

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,620
through a sports and all kinds of funky

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,030
things and Alan joined the army so David

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,930
killed one so if you google him he

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,840
claims you wrote this

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,270
and he didn't okay so who are we

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,100
Lloyds Banking Group so this is I want

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,480
to bore you with the details but we have

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,420
lots of brands you will see on the high

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,000
street sort of scotch waddles pure James

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,100
started just down the road Bank of

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,530
Scotland a B&E was one of our latest

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,870
acquisitions and we do all kinds of

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,680
things we do insurance we do car loans

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,240
we do sheer delaying pretty much we are

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,660
one of the biggest retail banks and the

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,460
high street 30 million customers

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,400
zillions of cards I think are mobile

00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,690
banking out for a check last night we

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,890
are like number two number three in the

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,340
table which is quite funny because it's

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:28,810
a sea map with a difference again so

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,750
transformation that's the reason that

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,390
James asked us along as Lloyds is going

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,940
through a massive transformation we are

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,510
about halfway through know our three

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,840
billion pounds exercise to transform how

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,610
the bank works from the grassroots

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,630
outwards and it is fundamental as

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,760
technology as how we operate it's how we

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,709
manage that's how we collaborate it's

00:03:51,760 --> 00:04:00,300
building a new organization so quite a

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,989
bit to start to transform because

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,890
customers are looking for things that

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,230
are increasingly personalised 20 30

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,340
years ago it was one size fits all you'd

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,200
walk down the high street there would be

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,660
a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland a

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,580
next door a bib and a branch of bankers

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,650
Scotland they both sold current accounts

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,700
the boss giving it scans at the same the

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,290
base of the same products trust suppose

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,850
no want and increasingly personalized

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,400
experience they want something that

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,729
works for them if you look at Jen for

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,439
example

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,259
20 years ago you heard Gordon's gin and

00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,759
you have Schweppes tonic and that was it

00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:38,339
so now if you walk into the gym aisle

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,050
the supermarket it's longer every single

00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,789
day and you've got about 40 different

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,589
kinds of Jen you've got about 25

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:45,150
different kinds of tonic so people are

00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,960
looking for an increasingly personalized

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,939
experience so what does that mean for us

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,479
it means that traditional high street

00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,849
until I from the banking is kind of is

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,719
on the wane where we are supporting more

00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:02,069
and more digital journeys and we have to

00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,860
be able to support the technology that's

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:09,389
out there know it be that mobile

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,830
internet watches wearables contacts we

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:15,330
have a dama which is a contactless ring

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:18,110
for making payments it means that as an

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:24,270
organization we have to be prepared to

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:26,870
take on new forms of competition so 20

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:31,099
years ago our competition was our RBS

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:34,709
HSBC that was the guy next door okay

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:38,009
last few years at Starling bank Monza in

00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,689
26 my son defected from Halifax 10:26

00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:44,189
only last week because you could get a

00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:45,509
metal cart so these guys by the way been

00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,199
going for about a year the back by

00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,729
French bank

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,849
they've got 1.5 million customers

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,949
already but the guys at the end of

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,499
things are going to be interesting okay

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,839
so while we are not Amazon or Google or

00:05:55,499 --> 00:06:00,389
Facebook these guys are interested and

00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,219
what we leave lying on the table and

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,379
they will come along and gobble our

00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:06,719
lunch if we can't react at their kind of

00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,430
speeds so Apple for example you've got

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,589
ever it's really with Apple pay but over

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,240
one of these things nowadays Apple have

00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,300
launched their own credit card in the

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,490
States Apple have got enough muscle to

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,020
talk to the Visa and MasterCard and get

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,360
them to change the rules to accommodate

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,800
things that Apple want to do so you

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,930
could have a card mouth which doesn't

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,610
have a logo on it right because Apple

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,849
want to do something it doesn't have

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,459
carbon number on it no Apple could Lobby

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:34,589
to change some of the rules around how

00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,069
payments get processed to suit how Apple

00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,569
want to work Facebook we all know has

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,909
had a flirtation worth Kenna

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,590
cryptocurrencies

00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:45,660
Amazon has its own payment alternative

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,030
Google has its own version of Apple P

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,740
and I'm sure Apple and Google and Amazon

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,530
and Facebook all have aspirations to

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,000
become more active financial players and

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,620
they all react very very very quickly

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,270
however that's probably not the biggest

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,910
scariest threat it's the stuff that we

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:11,070
can't see so if you think about Tesla

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:13,980
Tesla self life cars Elon Musk says that

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,600
once he is licensed to run his cars

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,090
fully autonomous all the time he's gonna

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,220
launch a Robo taxi fleet which is

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,260
wonderful unless you're an insurance

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,510
company so if you think about it there's

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,860
an entire market built on insurance so

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,650
people have got cars people buy car

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,230
insurance typically you pay for your car

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,780
to save your house idle for 23 hours a

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,090
day so find out just pee for a Tesla

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,680
taxi that will cover you for that one

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,320
hour so your commute to and from work or

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,580
doing the shops or whatever you don't

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,530
have to have a car you don't have to

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,120
have consumes what happens to the car

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,280
insurance in this case of Tesla launches

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,360
robot taxis car insurance could

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,310
evaporate overnight so we've got an

00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:00,090
organization have got to have systems

00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:03,690
that can react and that kind of speed we

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,890
couldn't before okay so so this is some

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,330
of the messages which will already be

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,540
mentioned so as an organization

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,740
historically we were very siloed

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,680
everybody worked on their own thing and

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,660
their own team and they didn't even see

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,010
the rest of the organization okay yeah

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,479
but occasionally your head will pop up

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,340
above the park right when you needed

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,110
something for somebody else and then you

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,610
would start swimming through the trickle

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,970
of trying to engage with another team to

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,290
do something on your behalf we were seen

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,789
as being very slow and we were very slow

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,280
most limitation the technology I think

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:39,000
it was just the legacy of the fact that

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,729
you're a 300 year old organization and

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,400
you have evolved very very slowly so

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,470
typically in a banking project you'd

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,690
save yourself up for a big bank so you

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,470
would do something and the project would

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,089
run for nine months 12 months maybe and

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,480
it would just go back there it goes were

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,970
into production

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,320
now a lot of people who are very

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,060
familiar with agile will tell you that

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,800
that's that is not the way you do things

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,250
because within an organization what

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,660
happens is you would have at the start

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,220
because it's going to be all month

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,780
project if you want something done you

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,670
have to get your requirements in at the

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,230
start and so you would have a massive

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,180
massive pile of requirements coming into

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,160
a project everybody wants something done

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,300
because they know the start of the year

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,890
this is the only chance you're going to

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,850
get to get some budget to go away and do

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,020
some work by the end of the year people

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,920
who wanted stuff in January what

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,710
forgotten what they asked for

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,240
although change their mind right and you

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,620
just spent a year and you've gone away

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,030
and you've built the shiny thing that

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,170
then nobody is going to use that's

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,390
assuming you actually managed to get the

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,010
shiny thing into life and you didn't get

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:44,170
tripped up with all kinds of stuff along

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:46,180
the way what we're doing now with in

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:52,300
Lloyds as we are trying to build the a

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:53,710
team and that is not only developers so

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,000
we want developers to be developers

00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,060
again we don't want developers to be

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,030
gang to mark other people's homework so

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,470
people will have a impression of the

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,780
banking industry in the finance industry

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,870
for the large companies we went

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,360
massively anti sourcing so all the jobs

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,400
sealed off overseas well the users we

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,400
are bringing them all back so my team

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,040
which is effectively card processing we

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,960
live in front and bench we've got half a

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,480
floor and a building and firm veg and we

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,310
will have early next year one hundred

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,330
seventy four point five people when the

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:31,930
point five is important coal located in

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:35,080
a building right looking after complete

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,450
customer journeys end-to-end so they

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,240
will we will have guys who can do the

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,980
the development for the banks internet

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,620
banking pages they can do native

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,600
development on mobile devices they'll be

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,420
able to work on any tech stack there any

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,890
of our customer journeys touch on and

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,620
they'll be sitting in the same team as

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,240
the guy that they depend on so we'll

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,100
have an engineer who will be doing the

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,080
the the native development for a mobile

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,520
phone app you'll be something the same

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,220
guy who is doing the system of record

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,090
COBOL kicks db2 work and yes we still do

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,090
COBOL right

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,650
so it's eeveelution action and by this

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,500
is your picture James you might have

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,820
recognized that when I was looking for

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,190
images I find your deck so with an

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,770
organization we run

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,470
thanks to mr. McLeod we have get up when

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,410
the frame is running internally we have

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,510
an active community practicing in our

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:35,920
source with a desire to move to open

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,990
source within our community our

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,040
engineering community we have discovered

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:45,010
safe ways to consume open source because

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,100
historically the bank is very very

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,970
risk-averse we are a highly regulated

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,980
environment so the going out and finding

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,110
something from a vendor was usually the

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,220
only option because you could go often

00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,900
if you do the due diligence on the

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,550
vendor and you could get things wrapped

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,339
up an escrow and everybody on the risk

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,540
side of the bank would be really happy

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:11,040
that you nailed everything down that

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,040
process in itself could take years

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,980
that doesn't train very well with the

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,640
whole being able to react that they kind

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,170
of Apple wake speeds so what we have

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,089
there with an organization we have

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,490
registered the domain called Alf

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:26,740
so if our engineers want to bring in an

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,220
open-source library they can so an

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,570
engineer can propose to his team that

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,950
they've found something out there as a

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,030
piece of open source which would

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,980
accelerate the project they're working

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,140
on so we have a way to be able to

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,240
consume open-source libraries safely

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,730
with the library what we're going to

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,140
bring into the bank there will be scan

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,190
for vulnerabilities so we'll make sure

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,010
it's not going to start transmitting

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,650
card numbers to the Russians and it will

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,270
be the licenses for the for the library

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,790
will be checked so so right down to the

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,430
components inside and that piece of

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,470
software will be given a rating which is

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,080
basically a traffic light so if the if

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,550
the software is rated as read it's hoped

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,779
the door we're going to bring it end

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,070
because it has got lots of

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,250
vulnerabilities that we are not going to

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,080
be able to resolve if it's kind of a

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,530
freemium where if it's something we've

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,380
got some potential license issues to

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,089
address then it would get a number which

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,290
was although the developer to bring it

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,839
into the organisation

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,029
and to do the work but you wouldn't be

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,819
able to take it to life and obviously if

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:29,920
it's green then it's bricks off off you

00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:33,399
go fill your boots take it all the way

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,660
through no well not just on that for

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,999
open source libraries we've done that

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,709
for tooling as well so if somebody wants

00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:43,389
to try out a tool that they've found

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,040
each of the value streams so we kind of

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,579
organize herself into value streams

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,579
that's the safe terminology will have a

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:54,549
tooling champion so there is me and

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,720
Kraig is another tooling champion so the

00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,339
engineer can come along speak to the

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,339
tooling champion explain what the tool

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,749
is what they want to use it for pointers

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,179
at the resorts then we'll go away and

00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,139
we'll check out the the license we'll

00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,149
also find out if there is something

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,910
potentially available already within the

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,470
bank that does the same job if not we

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,619
have a mechanism to bring that thing in

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,059
from outside the banks firewall make

00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:17,619
sure it's all security scan to make sure

00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,139
it doesn't bring any viruses into the

00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:23,499
organization and then we have a

00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:25,449
developer tools drive which is backed up

00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:26,160
with a site on confluence with a kind of

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,139
internal wiki

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,970
which explains what the two layers and

00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,589
then the developers can then consume and

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,759
so we have through all the communities

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:38,379
that we've got running them in the bank

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,720
we will share this so for example we

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,369
bring in a tool which is Eclipse based

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,829
on a regular basis when things get

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:46,389
updated will pop a message on our

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:48,459
effective lis internal Facebook saying

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,040
it's available and that'll being assumed

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,720
and the Portland dashboards we can now

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,730
monitor the uptake of these tools with

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,929
an organization because these tools tend

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,689
to write log records which we can

00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,970
analyze so we can look at how the open

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:06,540
source tooling is being consumed for the

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:11,949
organization so a general DevOps

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,660
transformation on a mainframe it's a bit

00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:17,439
of a scary door so again this is going

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:21,699
back to the the fact that we are highly

00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:24,910
regulated and there is an inherent

00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:27,160
conflict with a bank and speed because

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,829
you be all we want to be safe okay and

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,259
we have our operations guys whose job it

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,250
is to nail down a system and to make

00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:35,440
sure that we do

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,750
when five-nines availability that our

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,330
customers really would like to expect

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,460
from us but we've got the cowboy

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,420
developers who want to go Apple speed

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:48,130
and those things don't have to be

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,110
mutually exclusive because there are

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,640
things that we can do now with tooling

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,320
and development techniques which will

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,730
allow us to go fast and to go fast

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,670
safely because at the end of the day

00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:03,430
what the teams are attempting to deliver

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,530
as a shippable increment of software so

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,290
we deliver using agile that's the the

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,870
effectively goal for for scrum it's only

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,220
a 16 page pamphlet but at the end of the

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,810
day what we're trying to get out the

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,610
door there's a shippable increment of

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,320
software something we can put in front

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:24,580
of customers this when itself was a

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,890
fairly major mindset shift so this was a

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,270
shift away from let's save everything up

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,180
and do a big bank delivery at the end of

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,940
the year and to force a minimal Viable

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,650
Product so what's the thing that we can

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,000
get moving with what's the what's the

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,900
first thing you want to put in front of

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,230
a customer as a team we've been doing

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:47,890
this for about four years now we're

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:53,740
relatively mature we're about to do some

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:56,200
really scary things in 2020 how we

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,790
started we started building component

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,089
teams so if you're a large organization

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:06,130
this is probably the safest way to start

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,470
because if you're delivering things in a

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,630
waterfall making its own you have

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,689
projects which we traditionally attract

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,540
resources that's what I component team s

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:19,089
so when we started our agile journey we

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,730
kind of stopped to music and the guys

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,050
who are selling working on stuff they

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,990
got appointed as our first component

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,990
teams so a component team is something

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,620
as a team who are highly aligned to an

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,690
application they are optimized to

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,950
deliver the most lines of code possible

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,960
so it's all about getting widgets

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,850
through the sausage machine so a

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,110
component team would be cross-functional

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,700
because you will travel app developer

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,590
selling it but they would only billing

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:49,260
to single app they would contain your

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,909
to source your master's product owners

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,730
to manage the backlog and keep things

00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:55,230
running smoothly they are relatively

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,760
easy to implement which is why this is

00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,500
where we started they can operate with a

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,090
minimal set of chilling because like I

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,299
said we just stopped music and we use

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,200
the guys who were doing waterfall the

00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,179
are cross functional but

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,070
cross-functional and so far as we've

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,289
eliminated and the initial set handoffs

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,390
because we've got rid of the kind of lob

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:19,470
things over the wall to the test or kind

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:21,990
of handoff component teams have got cons

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,760
because they rarely deliver the the

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:27,029
actual customer proposition because it's

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,159
all about widgets and big organizations

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,899
are systems and their systems of systems

00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,909
so if you're only doing one widget

00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:37,590
you're liable to be a tooth on a cog in

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:40,110
a machine still handoffs of dependencies

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,029
you've got lots of them poor

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,570
opportunities for the team to learn new

00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:45,059
skills

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,640
it's kind of sweatshop coding and that's

00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,899
kind of not a very satisfying thing to

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,330
do when you come into work in the

00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:52,649
morning and to be honest because you are

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,000
just chugging things for your sausage

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,409
machine it's very easy to can fall back

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,529
on all the ways they're doing things and

00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,360
go back to doing waterfall delivery your

00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:02,370
product owner is a real product owner

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,210
because you're delivering widgets and

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,590
somebody else knows for the end-to-end

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,090
proposition actually looks like you're

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,549
just a dependency as far as they're

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:17,940
concerned we're removing is feature

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,169
teams so if you were a fin tech this is

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,600
where you would start because a year of

00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:24,029
a blank sheet of paper and you would

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,710
have in your team tanks you were capable

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:29,159
of doing everything for the piece of

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,570
work that you have in front of you which

00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,610
means they will deliver the most

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,350
valuable customer proposition because

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,750
you've got all the skills and a single

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,450
team co-located case you can talk to

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:43,860
each other across the desk who will do

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:47,669
the end-to-end journey cross application

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:50,100
cross platform as I said we've got guys

00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:52,080
who will be doing the front end and the

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,840
front end could be later for a mobile

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,250
phone it could be our specialization to

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,309
react if you're doing our internet

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,330
banking site the system will record for

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:03,600
most of our

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,610
systems has been frame okay now our

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,770
mainframe is a very modern device as

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,960
well it's all API top we have rest

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,430
services which support Letran end if you

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,710
want to add some data to a rest service

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,660
it's easier if you could turn around and

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,790
talk if James can see the con I need so

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,700
I actually need to get the credit card

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,570
number can you add that to the response

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,730
that's a conversation that's a

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,020
five-minute change that's not what's

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,550
fuller at request and engage another

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,770
team it makes their environment much

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:35,550
more rewarding because you can see

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:38,670
something that completes so you actually

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,230
see the outcome of your work one of the

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,520
reasons I like working in cards within

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,020
the bank more than some of the other

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,700
teams is because we produce something

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,630
physical so at the end of the day even

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,680
though it was a piece of plastic we

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,660
developed developed our systems and we

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,470
ran it we've got a piece of plastic if

00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,770
we could run during the shops and

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,730
actually test it okay

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,650
there's not many things you can do in

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,210
the bank that we can actually see

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:04,440
something tangible everything's very

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:06,690
virtual X Plex the the flexibility and

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,460
this kind of goes with the kind of team

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,770
makeup so what people talk about

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,300
t-shaped developers so we're looking for

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,620
calm shape developers we want people who

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,290
are going to be deep in more than one

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,500
area so it's kind of generalizing

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,820
specialists we would encourage the guys

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,520
who are working in teams to be more

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,470
technologists to kind of embrace the

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,230
chaos and try different things there are

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,690
some cons if you're a large organization

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,240
this kind of transformation can can

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,910
scheme can seem really scary to

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,220
implement it does require the investment

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,470
and tooling so you as well as going off

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,030
with after the proprietary tools you

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,350
have to embrace the open source tooling

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,910
because you cannot get this kind of

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,060
stuff up and running quickly without

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,440
going out there and trying things okay

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,750
so the guys are encouraged to experiment

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,520
so let's hope the whole idea of bringing

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,630
an open-source tooling is they can

00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,190
experiment they can bring a tool into

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,930
the bank safely we can give a try if it

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,500
works yeah if not what we want to try

00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,180
something else

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,410
you can't do that if you have to go

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,410
through a long procurement process

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,210
our teams need to be work needed to be

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:13,710
able to work independently so again this

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,619
is we're looking at things like

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,239
containerization so we can run a

00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:21,509
mainframe and say docker

00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:22,889
which is about freaky for some people it

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:25,830
gives our team's environment

00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:28,080
independence so we can run a simulation

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,090
and this kind of takes me back to the my

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,100
slide from a game of right the start

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,509
something something who has gone off and

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,609
very nicely written a simulator of the

00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:38,389
Commodore 16 so you can find that on the

00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:40,679
internet you can play it for yourself

00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:43,289
somebody has gone off and have written a

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,169
simulator in Red Hat for a mainframe

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:48,389
shared CPU which means that we've got a

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:52,080
product from IBM called effectively your

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:53,730
it's a personal mainframe all the

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,590
software that runs on that container is

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,149
the real mainframe software so it's the

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,029
stuff the guys would install in your box

00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:02,309
but it runs inside Red Hat and so the

00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,779
simulation of a mainframe CPU so because

00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,429
it is running as a process and so Red

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,320
Hat we can snapshot that and we can turn

00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:09,239
it into docker container so if we're

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,119
going to build our mainframe test

00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:13,679
environment in Red Hat takes about two

00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,899
and a half hours one says docker eyes

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,889
just two and a half minutes and I won't

00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,600
bore you with the details but I do have

00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:21,419
a video on here of it happening in real

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,489
time so you can spin up a test

00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,190
environment we can give each feature

00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:28,019
team its own test environment so they

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,940
can have a sound pet to do the front-end

00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,679
development okay which is fair enough

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,080
when they we've been able to do that for

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,869
years the distributor world now we can

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,100
give these guys their own mainframe so

00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:40,320
one of these docker containers will

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,929
support ten users okay so our typical

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,539
scrum team nine people so that's that so

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:47,369
everybody wants to log onto its their

00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:50,970
own mainframe they can have their own

00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:53,100
test data they can run it with no breaks

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,470
so we don't have dependencies on going

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,299
out to talk to security guys we don't

00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,970
have to talk to the DBAs we don't have

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,259
to talk to other systems programmers I

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,080
think probably Craig is learned more

00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,279
about being systems guy than ever before

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,960
getting these get these containers up

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,669
and running if the guys break it okay we

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,609
tear it down and we spin up to and

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:16,710
Happiness so there's no huge time lost

00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:19,900
you can burn through all your data throw

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:22,300
away spin up two and a half minutes

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,890
it gets us away from GDP art because we

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,540
can manufacture the test data in there

00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,280
and because that environment is it

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,890
completely enclosed and self-contained

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,540
we virtualized any of the dependencies

00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:36,970
around us we don't have to worry about

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,010
customer life customer data looking at

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,750
the test environment we don't have to go

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,890
to all the time and expense 2d

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,900
personalized things to give the

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,820
developers their own boxes because we've

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,970
got tooling that we've brought in which

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,160
will create us completely anonymous SD a

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,300
completely random test here and because

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,580
we've got everything in its own little

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,260
box it all joins up so one of the

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,840
problems would have had before where we

00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,270
had lots of systems running on real

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,860
platforms you had to talk to the guys

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,720
who looked after the customer database

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,800
to make sure that the card numbers on

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,660
the card database agreed with the

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,950
customers in the customer database know

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,730
we can just package the whole thing up

00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,680
and give the team's true independence as

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,350
an organization we have got to accept

00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,300
that these teams will slow down

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,520
periodically because we are going to

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,780
throw new challenges at them so a

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,150
feature team will be a long-standing

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,460
team it will be built for the work we

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,590
can see in front of us but as the year

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,730
goes on and because we are running in an

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,410
agile way

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,300
somebody might decide to trim the tail

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,890
on an initiative that the team are

00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,960
working on and it will just get flung in

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,610
a bin and they will then start working

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,830
on the next most important thing that

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,100
might bring in a technology that ta

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,690
haven't experienced yet so no we will

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,510
give the guys the chance to go in alone

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,870
ok and that will be baked into the

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,700
velocity so we're as part of the

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,530
everyday workload we kind of try and

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,360
maintain a 60/40 split between what the

00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,730
guys are working on so the guys will

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,060
work say 60% of their time on delivering

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:06,790
things in the sprint for the backlog 40%

00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,590
of the time will be other stuff so that

00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,670
could be the kind of mandatory training

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,500
that we have to do because we're a

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,850
regulatory organization and everybody

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,240
has to make sure we knew how to fight

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,480
fraud and such like all that time could

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
be

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,310
to conduct an experiment to go and try

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
something out to bring a new tool in to

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:27,160
bring in a new piece open-source

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:31,180
software have a play were there we are

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,559
moving to our to platform strategy so

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,749
system a record with

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,789
typically be the mainframe but the

00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:39,279
system of engagement could be anything

00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:41,980
right it could be some on trim kit it

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,779
could be the cloud okay so we have quite

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,710
publicly partnered with IBM and

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:50,139
Microsoft so we've got an IBM private

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,330
cloud offering we've got a Microsoft

00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:54,009
Azure public cloud offering so these

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,990
things can be spun up quite easily the

00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:57,249
guys have got access the dashboard so if

00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,870
they want to try something that they can

00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:02,200
spin up a machine have a little play

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:04,570
with it it's raw way again these were

00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,110
things that you couldn't do definitely

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,889
could do when I joined the organization

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:13,570
things that it couldn't have done a

00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:15,009
couple of years ago but Lloyds Banking

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,549
Group is a completely different beast

00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:23,259
from Lloyds Banking Group of maybe two

00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:27,369
three years ago what should you do a

00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:29,499
line is blurry so when we're looking at

00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:31,179
how we're going to build our team there

00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:32,409
are considerations it's not what

00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,360
suddenly we're going to do everything is

00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,649
feature teams we will have component

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,070
teams in the mix there will be

00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:41,110
applications which are mission critical

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,669
and we will still run those as component

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,720
teams because we want the gangs who

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:45,429
really really know how those

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,980
applications work to be the only people

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,389
touching that that code base because

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,950
these are the applications say for

00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:54,249
example the ones that offer eyes your

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,269
card transactions before we used to say

00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,490
that would get you in the Sunday papers

00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:58,960
no some people take to Twitter and about

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,049
five minutes after they've had the card

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,119
declined your 5,000 people complaining

00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:05,860
so mission-critical applications we

00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,940
can't allow them to fail so we some of

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,549
these things would see its component

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,200
teams how do we start with teams

00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:14,379
touching stepping on each of those tools

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,200
give them independence the whole virtual

00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:20,249
machine the whole simulating environment

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,330
giving each team its own capabilities

00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:24,519
we've tried not to get hung up on

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,499
forcing one model so we are kind of been

00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,470
all embracing so we are we within the

00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:30,759
comms team we are gonna have a hybrid so

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:33,429
2020 we've just finished our planning

00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:37,629
for next year we are reorganizing the

00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:39,070
lab into its new layer these teams will

00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,840
be long standing for the next year and

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,159
there will be some component teams but

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,159
we will be mostly feature teams

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,350
if anything we've learned anything over

00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,020
the last couple of years at school

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,750
location pays dividends so four we still

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,860
make a lot of use as an organization of

00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:00,290
the patrols the TCS ease of this world

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,210
the guys are going to be co-located in

00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,400
the same room with everybody so the

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,870
entire team sets together and just

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,220
improving the channels of communication

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:13,370
pays gigantic dividends in itself okay

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,910
so quick coding challenge I have my

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:21,470
colleagues developer a and developer see

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:23,440
we've got five guys to do this so we've

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,570
got a little coding challenge for them

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,130
so basically here's a story from the

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,270
backlog which is as a customer I'd like

00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:33,220
to be able to review my account

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,220
information and curve details together

00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:47,090
so with any luck would one of you guys

00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:50,270
want to show what the Oz's is oh sorry

00:29:47,090 --> 00:30:06,170
on do okay I guess yep let me drag it

00:29:50,270 --> 00:30:07,430
onto the screen using constellation

00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:11,660
which is an in-house

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:14,090
react component library and basically as

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,700
it stands at the moment the the

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:20,330
application only shows the customer

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,770
overview so the as a customer I want to

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,280
be able to view my account information

00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,500
and my card details together so

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,600
currently this is viewing REST API

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,940
that's directly exposed from the

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,090
mainframe and this is all the data that

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:38,090
are currently shows and what will happen

00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:42,320
now is on the fly Craig will changed the

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:45,470
API I will make some changes into react

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,820
code and you'll be able to see the chain

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,900
so to prove that is actually making a

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,429
change

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,429
this was skimmed as Bank of Scotland

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,459
which is using

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,459
[Music]

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,779
[Music]

00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:16,950
I mean this is just using the next

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:38,360
version of react it's a straight-up

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:38,360
create react using NPM special service

00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,730
know something we're all sold you get

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,730
the main people exposed rests on the

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,620
back end for this is good old cork XD we

00:33:31,010 --> 00:34:08,030
do which is the main drain butter what

00:33:33,620 --> 00:34:14,540
kicks will talk rest will talk saw with

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:16,240
the rest API is a public public so these

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,040
are these are exposed with unalloyed

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,380
solenoids we have a product called API

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,550
connect which helps any internal API

00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:28,640
discovery so we do have API switch are

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,750
exposed externally these aren't that's

00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,710
what open banking ones been the most

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:35,720
obvious ones and so we have btp data

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,720
power so we do talk rest to other

00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,340
organisations it tends to be part look

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,890
and banking ones but these are private

00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,649
at the moment but there's no reason why

00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,800
in the future the the API is that we we

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:51,880
have is open banking should move beyond

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,880
who's the customer and make a payment

00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:09,390
that is enterprise cobol that's all

00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:13,500
Sixpoint - no it's okay you've been able

00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:16,680
to do rest probably since Kobol four and

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,599
that's got easier so there are no

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,859
language features the core balls be an

00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,480
object-oriented sense thinking

00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,130
maintenance but if anybody wanted to be

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,640
that professor to write an

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,230
object-oriented cobol program but yeah

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,640
you've been able to do certainly soap

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:35,250
supports and what was invented okay so

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,630
we we started doing rest at will we had

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,240
to kind of cook your own parse off to be

00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:42,619
honest to get started for the JSON but

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,619
there's no language support for that

00:35:47,180 --> 00:36:28,559
things Craig's doing his change that's

00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,549
one of the biggest changes that happens

00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,470
next year so yeah traditionally up until

00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:36,510
this point we have been project funded

00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,040
so somebody in the business has a bright

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,210
idea

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,530
and the come-along will engage with us

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,780
in the usual way and we all kind of

00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,819
stick a finger in the air and we'll say

00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,599
it's this amount necessary

00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:53,520
and every drop until ya drop in the team

00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:58,559
now next year we get as an organization

00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:02,670
the share of our spend so our lab gets a

00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:04,950
budget which covers the run cost for all

00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,540
our applications of the one cost for the

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:10,859
team or one hundred seventy four point

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,750
five people an allowance for

00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,100
discretionary work that the

00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,590
business want to do and obviously our

00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,260
big allowance for the mandatory and

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,810
regulatory things we need to do so one

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,530
of the things so our last head of

00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,880
engineering John Webster had a saying

00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,590
that he had the entire organization

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,220
saying go run around which is more jam

00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:33,510
for tomorrow so the lab owns the budget

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,160
so we own the budget for everything to

00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:39,570
do with cards and if we have lots of

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,910
technical debt that were drowning in and

00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:45,300
we have loads of currency issues with

00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:47,070
applications and we're not embracing new

00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,650
ways of working and you to laying and

00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,020
bringing things in open source then then

00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,640
it's going to be really slow and the

00:37:52,020 --> 00:38:00,150
business will not have the money to do

00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:17,010
discretionary change yeah so the the mo

00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:19,080
claps than the one this is the

00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:37,110
deployment happening in real time so it

00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:48,210
takes about two minutes right now like

00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:49,530
say and the main thing here is but also

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,020
more than anything else

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,540
this event this evening is about

00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,120
building a community and to do that we

00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:03,720
need you to tell us what you want to see

00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:07,760
from their phones out let's give you one

00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,760
minute where everybody feels that

00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:27,500
yeah that's mileage totes ain't so yeah

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:29,050
that's my legs don't side not within the

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,550
container the container executables

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,930
source code so the moment we use a

00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,540
traditional mean free product called

00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:38,270
endeavour which has limited income

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,190
development capability one of the big

00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,530
engineering transformations we're going

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,240
to do next year as I would probably move

00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,630
a lot of our source and to get good so

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,300
of mainframe soft code running and get

00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,890
IBM have got technology called

00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,840
dependency driven build that we're going

00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,220
to have a little experiment with which

00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,020
means that when you when you clone a

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,820
repo you don't clone every single thing

00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:05,210
you only clone the bets that you're

00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:06,710
interested in real db2 as well yeah so

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,390
but well that's not so as an

00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,640
organization we've pretty got much got

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,110
every tech staff out there by within our

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:22,820
team we've got pretty much every tech

00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:42,980
stack over there okay MongoDB likes to

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:45,380
be where the codes been changed I've

00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:50,330
changed the styling and we now have the

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:52,480
account overview and details and you

00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,480
know

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,219
[Applause]

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:21,420
yeah it's really you know a central

00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:23,520
design space yes well the law is loyd

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,900
it's all picked of a wide specialization

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,900
or on react so

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,130
