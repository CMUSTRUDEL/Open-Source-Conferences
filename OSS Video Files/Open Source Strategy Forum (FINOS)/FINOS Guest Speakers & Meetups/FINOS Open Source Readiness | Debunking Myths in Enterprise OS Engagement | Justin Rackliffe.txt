[Music]

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,060
thank you to everyone for joining and

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,980
we're very excited to have Justin

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,289
Ratcliffe from fidelity investments

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,150
presenting today I've had the pleasure

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,510
of hearing

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,099
Justin speak last year at the Linux

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,370
Foundation open source Leadership Summit

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,180
and with his many years of experience

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,989
inside a highly regulated industry which

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,780
we all know are not it's not always in

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,700
their nature to collaborate you know

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,710
he's he's certainly been working on open

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,989
source with fidelity and across the

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,780
industry for some time and and will have

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:58,260
some very interesting and helpful

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:06,770
insights to share with us today so with

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:09,119
that we'll I'll take note of attendees

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,390
but the other me has been kicked out

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,110
apparently and then and we'll we'll go

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,939
ahead and get started hand over to Jason

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,960
about Justin oh my goodness did I just

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,960
call you Jason multiple times

00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,670
[Music]

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:57,869
presenter so kind of taking it from what

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:02,030
many of us have board unaccountable

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:06,119
parties that kind of tried to guide our

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:10,179
open-source practices and shifted it

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,269
over to some of these formal

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,430
Foundation Jana don't read too much into

00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:18,250
the life stuff is actually helps with

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,250
trademark killing whenever I whenever I

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,040
use our corporate presentation materials

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,230
I would get the trademark folks on me

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,500
so choose a Linux Foundation and still

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:34,420
be fine and what are they trying to to

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,319
get us on board they're try to formalize

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,019
program you can you can get timing so

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,150
again the aqua was found in late 2007

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:49,299
who knows what happened in early 2017

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,060
but that was what happened so then

00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,889
really working there and try to do some

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,299
cool stuff I've done a lot of stuff in

00:02:53,889 --> 00:03:02,109
the past and work with the OpenStack

00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:03,790
foundation and generally trying to do

00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:07,569
infrastructure kind of cool stuff and

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,819
now cloud tech school stuff and open

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:14,349
source type of cool stuff so out of the

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:18,159
meeting so this was a deck I given at

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:22,150
the OpenStack forum foundation event in

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,859
New York back in December I guess and it

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,260
really comes down to it's a little

00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:29,739
lesson learned best practices we all

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:33,220
know we can share best practices goal is

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,650
what's called 20% experts on 20 minutes

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,220
of expedition half an hour or whatever

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,909
we have left for actual conversation I

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,799
find that usually actually more helpful

00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,150
in think of this as it kind of will call

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,220
it day two

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,650
you've already decided that open source

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,470
is important your management decided

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,479
that open source is important and you

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,370
you mount that okay now I got a not so

00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,409
what comes next

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:04,509
and oftentimes that's complicated

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,669
because when you're dealing with is

00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:11,139
corporate culture you're dealing with a

00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:14,500
legacy or way of thinking and you become

00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,109
really really complex but they do it

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,930
honestly frustrating

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:22,800
and we'll disheartening at times to

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,620
break through some of that little but

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,060
one one keeping reasonable is this kind

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,849
of quote is that these myths and these

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,490
things that we're battling against as we

00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:37,669
try to change corporate culture are

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,939
there for a reason

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:44,759
oftentimes these practices or not they

00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,460
were put in place to prevent us from

00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,250
doing things that were put in place to

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,979
try to protect the brand and protect the

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:57,810
firm protecting all the associates who

00:04:52,979 --> 00:05:00,240
are trying to do their jobs and they may

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,219
have to change it between but we have to

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,310
do that with it with a healthy amount of

00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:08,789
respect for why they were there

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,219
too often I've seen and talked with

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,379
teams that they people just don't get it

00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:15,240
or they're dealing with backward

00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,069
thinking or anti-patterns whatever the

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,379
case may be whatever they want to brand

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:24,960
it a corporate context black you have a

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,589
conversation of why that's they're like

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,339
no they're just wrong and that doesn't

00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,990
get you very far

00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:34,770
honestly you're going to lose a lot of

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:39,000
credibility inside our organization if

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:43,680
you try to just say well the world has

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,020
changed you need to catch up and it's

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,189
gonna let lead to a level of rejection

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,379
on everything that you're trying to do

00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:56,460
so this session is really just about

00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:57,870
what I call miss and their ways of

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,349
thinking they're things that have come

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,870
up I think that I've dealt with over the

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:07,370
last couple years and try to distill

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,770
them essentially into Karev again

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,080
buckets but but generally just trying to

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,789
make people aware and go oh oh yeah I

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,710
heard about that or I feel that and

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:23,819
hopefully tell Evert right

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,340
I like lead off with with the myths of

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:32,010
myths from your OpCo

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:34,230
yourself and the first one is of kind of

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,639
the you can if you build it they will

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,690
come

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,400
mentality that's actually a picture of

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,419
Gilda dreams I did not try to pursue

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,979
actually getting getting kevin costner

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:49,320
design off i'm using his good like this

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:53,370
but some we have been feeling like once

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,220
we create this new program and we put

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,380
out a webpage on the corporate system if

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,660
you send out a couple of emails all of a

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,240
sudden the army of associates is going

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,000
to start showing up and trying to do

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,669
great things

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,120
sorry sorry this point just is probably

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,919
not going to work out that way the ausco

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,380
really have to get it from there because

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,060
again you're dealing with a systematic

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,300
level of thinking people who have been

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,990
working in one model in often using open

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,229
source

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,720
maybe you've contributed but often

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,220
consuming open source they wouldn't

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,229
think of doing anything else they're not

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,130
busting out a proprietary front-end

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:38,490
frameworks anymore but they think of it

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,229
in very much attractive mode and that's

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,750
not bad

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:44,789
but one of our roles in trying to build

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,789
an open community and a better

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,789
engagement externally and honestly why

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,070
we're all here and you know it is

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:56,070
foundation exists is the kind of

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:59,910
breakers ourselves out of this shell so

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,610
we really have to lean in what are our

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,520
goals here and it's going to be

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:09,690
marketing I know every eat loves

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,260
marketing just like I love public

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:17,370
speaking but you need to be able to

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,289
wrestle with that and figure out how do

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,660
people but from your corporate culture

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:25,560
what are the systems of record that they

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:28,169
go do because some may live purely on

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,810
email so you getting a Twitter handle

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:33,390
and starting to put stuff out there

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,050
let's just say here your key

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,440
communication policy is very liberal

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,000
that may not work

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,800
it may not stick for your associates

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,500
it's just not the way that things are

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,200
done so you really have to listen what

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,380
are ways that people are finding that

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:55,390
they can hear about new things but also

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:58,390
not not get buried in noise we all get

00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,810
way too much even all of it is so again

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:08,080
it's very much a listening say advocacy

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:11,740
so when we look at when I kind of dealt

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,810
with what my role is a lot of it comes

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,450
down to developers want to do things but

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,730
there's there's somebody else who is

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,250
skeptical and it can be your

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,410
responsibility to lean in with technical

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,170
details and subject-matter expertise on

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,930
why you actually can do something and

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,720
sometimes the developers their own

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:35,830
biggest critic I found some that are

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,630
like will say hey you should put all the

00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,330
governance for the project but there is

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,040
no governance just use the copyright

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,050
header in your source code box or your

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,540
patches or whatever you're doing they're

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,980
like well I don't know if the upstream

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,790
projects are going to allow for that

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:55,270
because we have to give them the

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:58,300
copyright I'm like no no you know and I

00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,710
hate that developer so those two just

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,800
off the fact that they can't do

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,910
contributions because of a copyright

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,190
notice and you'll get a little bit of an

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,290
opportunity to educate them around

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,710
what is copyright what does that matter

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,840
what you have to do what just happens

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:20,370
and it may make them feel more

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,830
comfortable in actually dealing with

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,440
with their management or their security

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:30,550
office or their auditor whomever that

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,710
they have to deal with you can you can

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,080
help me that bridge help them feel more

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,750
comfortable in an ecosystem which is

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:41,970
very risk-averse we've had a very tough

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,650
day or enough week in the market and

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,360
people are not necessarily looking to

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,819
voluntarily do something that's risky

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,289
and so

00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,899
you have to be able to build that

00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:55,509
comfort me coming up alongside them

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:59,049
being their advocate can be the thing

00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:04,379
that allows them to go and have those

00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:08,639
conversations references so oftentimes

00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:11,259
people just don't believe it happens so

00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,589
being able to point out and build those

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,199
those kind of relationships within your

00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:21,669
firm about hate with what they've worked

00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:24,939
well what they didn't and connecting

00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:28,089
lacan prospects because it's only a

00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:31,149
little business going here prospects

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,639
with those who have been successful and

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,919
those who your partners who may help you

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:41,259
improve your process or taking off rough

00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:43,689
edges and in that your networks you're

00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:46,959
going to know so many people across your

00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:48,669
firms because we're all siloed we all

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,089
work in different teams we all think

00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:55,959
that we're in some ways unique sorry

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:58,329
we're not you can be you can be those

00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,029
that bridge filter help people come

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:04,720
together give them places to have a

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:06,939
conversation grab coffee that they may

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,209
not have dealt with because of their

00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:12,359
line of business our retirement type

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,769
versus our retail brokerage side

00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:16,059
sometimes I have to kind of pull them

00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:22,179
together in a room you know they just

00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:26,369
don't normally cross paths so now we get

00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:28,509
into an fx that self raise is going to

00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:30,939
look for that plane to your own eye

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:34,389
before your your check-ins respect of

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:36,009
others one minute and then private most

00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:40,389
common one is going to be from your

00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:43,409
associates so again you'll find it

00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,669
especially if you're new you can't do it

00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:48,699
it's going to take forever the giant

00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:53,039
door and easy essentially you use how to

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:56,850
believe within the organization that

00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,800
doing open source it purely just kinda

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,959
consuming passively there's no way to

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,810
open a pass there's no way to correct a

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,000
bus you can't even open an issue because

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,040
it might be communications which is

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,550
heavily regulated and we just can't do

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,029
that how what you want to be able to do

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:17,970
is is get away from that there

00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,160
uncertainty in depth and again a lot of

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,740
times and heavily regulated turns that's

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,980
going to come through artifacts so

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,079
what's your quarter policy if you don't

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,630
have one don't blame your associate

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,290
certain for complaining or being

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,360
skeptical or being concerned you have to

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,519
put something in place it has to be

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,649
well-written you have to talk to your

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:44,459
legal folks and say okay I really want

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:47,430
to make this durable people need to know

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,509
that what they're doing is good and if

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,009
they have questions

00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:54,540
take it as feedback if they have

00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:57,180
concerns look for ways that you can I

00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,199
want to amend the policy but add

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,120
metadata around that policy scenarios

00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:05,220
that kind of stuff I know one that's

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,160
come up with me a couple times has been

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,709
something that I ruthlessly as private

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,889
hear from Jeff McCaffrey now it at

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,439
github but it's all the movement like

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:20,579
Microsoft's at the time can i you will

00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:24,000
sort off company hours what time to get

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:27,449
sticky if there's a little bit of

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,660
greater here there and it really comes

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:33,449
into motivation but I went and I talked

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,069
to my my ethics team is that okay we

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:38,759
don't people are volunteering in some

00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,040
communities we don't want to know about

00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,300
that we don't spend a whole lot of time

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,439
if they're working on computers and

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,970
teaching somebody for pay but Voki early

00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:49,860
in a volunteer kind of mode

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,660
they don't even to have that kind of

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,720
have you awareness allies rating

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,050
software any different and we try to

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,709
kind of build out scenarios where it's

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:04,620
clearly not window fidelity related or

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:06,059
it is clearly fidelity related and then

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,260
also stuff in the middle

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,320
where

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,640
you could kind of get to a gray area and

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,900
you don't want to create an appearance

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:19,920
of issues so who to have conversations

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,710
with is that occurs and really just help

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,230
the developers feel comfortable with

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,310
what they're doing and why didn't the

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:34,550
threat to their career in fact it may be

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:37,200
a leg up education again that same vein

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,570
taking them all of that that experience

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,190
and that subject matter expertise in

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:47,910
putting it in formats that are

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,860
appropriate for your organization it

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,190
hopefully allows for some level of

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,360
certification pass/fail on some level

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:59,970
and really focuses developer on that

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,460
those shared responsibilities because

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,590
again like any large organization you

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:08,340
can't scale you can't have a marquee

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:12,720
enhancement trying to please github it

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:15,300
just doesn't work so what you need is to

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,240
promote awareness develop throughout all

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,730
the developers that one or what are the

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,780
core screams how does light nursing work

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,600
what is security

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,430
what's our tooling what's our

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,340
development lifecycle tooling all that

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:33,090
kind of stuff how this all helps to do

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:39,570
open source well and promote an external

00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:42,000
surface but maybe leave away some of the

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:47,930
finer grain you don't need to go into

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,880
deep deep copyleft history or archeology

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,000
but need to be able to kind of indicate

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,820
people what things matter how to measure

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,090
it what are best practices what a digit

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,120
attribution look like give people some

00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:06,089
really general handles and they will do

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,470
the right thing and they will help you

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,990
if they see something that's wrong

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,120
they'll probably let you know because

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,670
you've been their advocate you've talked

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,230
to them and said hey I want to help you

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,060
out in doing this because you think

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:23,360
you're excited about it

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,360
the firm should be excited about it and

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,760
generally helping them the so make your

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,160
eyes and your next level of advocates

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,500
your ambassadors and each one of those

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,380
organizations that you're not the

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,830
corporate bureaucracy trying to stop

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:45,240
people from doing cool things and again

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:46,650
process it needs to be girlier people

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,260
need to be able to look at something go

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,780
yep I know how to do this I know what my

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,710
gates are I know what you talk to if

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:57,300
that's necessary hopefully reducing that

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,470
kind of manual broths thing as much as

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:05,100
possible but generally giving people a

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,600
clear set of instructions and what to do

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,130
and being open for them today is

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,560
something they make a whole lot of sense

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:15,150
to me because tools change processes

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,690
James waved with a fixed problem change

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:21,150
get up and didn't really exist a couple

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,120
years ago but now it is and all of a

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:27,240
sudden you have configuration defining

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,150
infrastructure in pull requests using

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,110
use for change tickets ok well that's

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,870
different

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,580
what does that mean and how do we make

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,920
sure that's reflected in all of our

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:42,690
prophecies give people a level of

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:48,000
toughness that what they're doing is the

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:53,910
stage and appropriate everybody's

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,830
favorite security again the

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,970
tongue-in-cheek on on making references

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,160
to early 2017 but these things are real

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,980
no one wants to show up on the front

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,560
page because of this type of work

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,050
because of security issues we're already

00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,930
having enough time with with a

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:17,820
transactional load we don't need to

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:20,880
stack on there so how can you work with

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,110
your security folks and you're inside

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,390
legal teams to be that partner and again

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:30,540
a lot of it is taking your expertise and

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,960
your knowledge in helping describe some

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,260
of the

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,880
loans that working in doing open-source

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:42,179
well in a sustainable way it helps the

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,919
result so what's the risk in a fork

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,409
could you here be able to say well can

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,549
we just get that code and take it away

00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:54,510
from get up and then just work on it and

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:57,149
yeah you could but get the right answer

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:00,120
and being able to describe to them what

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,760
that means long term sure it works day

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:07,200
one but what does a 20 look like or day

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:10,500
50 and be able to describe that in real

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,799
security level terms in compliance and

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:17,850
licensing terms what that means long

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,220
term and again when we look at the

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,020
viability of projects the more our our

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,760
firm that don't invest in these common

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,370
platforms in these tools with our

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,580
development hours really trying to do

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,649
the hygiene stuff not just consuming it

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,630
it may be not even just paying her a

00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:40,320
commercial distribution but really

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,210
investing our talent there it takes away

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,260
from that community the project is not

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,220
going to move forward

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:52,440
because they're big users are coming at

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,210
it through some sort of lens and we want

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,669
to be able to promote diversity within

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,630
those projects because that is what

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:04,289
allows them to evolve to better meet

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:06,149
everyone needs and no one no one wants

00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,940
to bet their business on a project

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:12,750
that's potentially going to sunset if it

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,610
gets stuck that's a risk and we need to

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,000
be able to provide some context to it

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:20,789
provide evidence to it and at least in

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
my experience that's made a lot of sense

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:27,539
to the security folks they see that they

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,940
recognize that that when projects go

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,309
abandoned or they go stale because

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:36,330
there's not a good vibrant community

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:38,399
around it they're going to have to find

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,240
an alternative that's expensive and it's

00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:43,900
risky so they get that and then enjoys

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,540
that somebody pulled out the actual

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:50,080
property he's the Kingdom granules other

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,960
stuff I always have to be the bearer of

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,360
bad news most of the open source is not

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,260
going to pass a novel test it's not

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,670
unique you are not special and I did not

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,880
get to pop that bubble bubble on a

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:06,820
regular basis and again it's not

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,500
something that doesn't negatively is

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,360
that you don't have to be concerned with

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,160
it I know who I need to talk to from our

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,280
intellectual property attorneys whether

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,710
it's programs or patents programs

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,860
trademark codes where it matters or

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:27,130
where we might have potentially

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,270
something that could be patentable but

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,340
generally it's going to help people

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,390
understand that that's just not it's not

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,720
something to deal with on a regular

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,750
basis and you shouldn't necessarily

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,850
allow it to be the specter that hangs

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:44,560
over your developers because again it's

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,140
going to prevent them from doing cool

00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,080
things or thinking about doing cool

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,820
things just just in just our interests

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,360
jumping in at that time because it's an

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,650
interesting point so just because as you

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,350
said that some of mine have an issue

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,360
even when they do that doesn't stop the

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,660
open sourcing so just to confirm and

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,150
make sure you agree you can patent an

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,640
idea and still open source it and drive

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,980
it very open source market but that does

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,300
give you more options if you have the

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:19,840
pattern in place yeah we don't what I

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:23,800
like to make sure it seems super unique

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,330
and super cool something that may in a

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,140
full powers world be able to be

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:31,540
patentable if that wasn't the case just

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,430
like I would tells me to go talk to the

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,800
ethics folks I've introduced into our IP

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,440
folks and we go through the discussion

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,850
and get it on the records that we don't

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,890
want to pursue patents around this

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,560
because what you don't want to do if

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,840
somebody does be cool it gets it it

00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,960
takes off like wildfire and then you

00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:54,120
have somebody from your your internal IP

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,330
team go did we get a patent on this

00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,900
this isn't comfortable for everybody so

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,790
it's a level of due diligence but again

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,190
it's probably going to be most likely a

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,960
rounding error on the number of

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,630
conversations that you're going to have

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,790
most people are you were think they're

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,559
well understood and the one you offer to

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,809
give me where I'll stay quorum for us is

00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,610
our theory of omission that we've now so

00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,440
that's reputation all with the toss

00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,840
beginner spin-off is all sorts of

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,120
financial opportunities but what's

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,830
interesting for us is it doesn't stop

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,470
your open sourcing at though it's still

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,660
a really really good method to go open

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,720
source drive that requirement get other

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,490
people involved but interests enough you

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,110
work in conjunction with your IP team

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:42,270
not you know not them trying to protect

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:44,670
everything again the communication is an

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,530
essential is kind of caught up on deck

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:51,300
foundational principle across all of

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,830
these news topics talk to people don't

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,140
make assumptions because the assumptions

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,120
will come back it doesn't you can't deal

00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,800
with them just becomes awkward and

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,559
that's going to be a disincentive eyes

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,170
or for others to follow suit because

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,360
they heard that somebody is they got the

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,929
twelfth degree because they didn't go

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,910
and check with IP first be that broker

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:14,670
help to kind of limp them that stuff for

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:18,660
your teams and look for those

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,550
opportunities but also be the Advocate

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,610
was a you know what we're going to open

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:26,820
source those things they're great patent

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:29,309
holding groups that allow folks to be

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,330
able to do cool things in build on

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:32,870
innovation

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,270
let's not try to take those innovations

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:41,100
put them behind the wall and then just

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:44,460
give you an implementation again it may

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,980
be reputational they become them awkward

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,160
and again that's not the future of open

00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,910
source that's not why we're all here is

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,580
to figure out how to necessarily drive

00:25:53,910 --> 00:26:00,500
heading up the revenue

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:02,630
through licensing or create a little bit

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,620
of friction there that it's not helpful

00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:08,360
probably for our core businesses again

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,210
it's something that is a concern and you

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,630
need to be able to respect because it is

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,550
part of corporate culture but it's

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,560
something that you want to be able to to

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,740
be that bridge to talk to you about all

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,010
the different movies and hopefully

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:28,090
getting some better results but yeah

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,170
great point that's always a fun one

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,990
especially with lifting more mature

00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:36,800
firms when it comes down to open source

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:39,950
and you have folks who are like we won't

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,960
do patents that's not good but that also

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:46,370
creates problems in versus we're going

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,110
to do happens and we're going to do in a

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:55,280
way that doesn't protect them and wet in

00:26:51,110 --> 00:27:01,040
in a manner that prevents collaboration

00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:03,380
or prevents engagement so one lapse

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:08,750
misses again this was called a 20 minute

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:14,510
deck management is always a fun one we

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:16,520
all love earpiece and people will make a

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,340
budget they'll make a giant future

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,780
budget to bring on associate they'll be

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,820
focused on actually hitting the self

00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,920
done and then for me that's hey I want

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,000
to make it had some open source projects

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,360
and they go well that's going to be any

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,720
cost for me I'm not going to get a

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,220
feature or I'm not going to get

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,250
something out of you

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:42,110
in you need to be able to step in there

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:44,210
and help understand if not just about

00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,730
talk about security but there's also the

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,950
costs the main the maintenance of those

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,290
downstream Forks or the maintenance of

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,720
the workarounds for above that you know

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:58,670
is there but you're unwilling to invest

00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,250
upstream it collects the technical debt

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,470
will cost you

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,440
and sometimes management team is unaware

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:08,769
of that because they're so used

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,529
something from some that are party that

00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:15,009
well they'll fix it for us

00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:18,720
and again make that through you don't

00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:22,210
drive their timeline in both cases and

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,360
it becomes complicated there's a lot

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,789
more efficient ways especially for even

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,769
commercial distribution type projects

00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:33,759
we've done some patches or things that

00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:37,269
we pay for data that allowed us to get

00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,889
value from that feature quicker and yeah

00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:41,379
we when we talk with that commercial

00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:42,909
team and said hey we got this full

00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:44,289
request is really super valuable for us

00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:48,370
but we want to see in the commercial

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:54,100
distribution how do we make that go

00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:57,159
faster and the partner was super well in

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,409
a habit of conversations and we all

00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,529
benefit the product is better they're

00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:06,070
better users it was more secure a whole

00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:10,240
lot of good stuff so this conversation

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:12,669
becomes super helpful and they become

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,340
something the g-men reference to other

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:19,000
teams as they approach these challenges

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:22,750
I don't I don't play the talent one

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,309
really really hard it is something I

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,429
think we ought to be aware of

00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:29,080
I wouldn't over rotate it especially

00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:31,620
when you start looking at things like

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,139
well give up your resume kind of thing

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:38,559
it can create diversity inclusion

00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:42,279
concerns accessibility concerns they can

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:47,009
be career challenges for those and can't

00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:50,590
publish all of their their internal work

00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:53,860
so what you want to be able to do is to

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:57,070
really talk to the ability for people to

00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:01,500
engage not only in source code but also

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:04,779
externally talking attending events

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,970
participating in events all of that kind

00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:09,149
of stuff needs to be part of those

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,889
conversations because it's those visible

00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:15,250
things that are going to get developers

00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:16,929
their keynotes are great but it's it's

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,250
that talk that really catches a

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:20,140
developer they go

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,059
that was awesome I want to know more

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,070
about that how can I be a part of that

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:27,480
and if they can be a part of that

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:30,760
publicly through some open source work

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,970
that's rate and they can go to your your

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,740
repo du jour your external position and

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,350
to get up get lapped over the length of

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,530
the matter and they can see what things

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:45,159
you're investing in there to be more

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:49,000
willing to when that opportunity shows

00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:52,720
up to throw their resume and you can

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,220
have the better conversations so the the

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,000
type of talent here you get is going to

00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:00,070
be the talent that's the most invested

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,200
in in the project and you're excited

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,120
about because they can be visible

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,100
they're not just potentially looking for

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:10,030
a paycheck we all are that kind of

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:12,960
Maslow's hierarchy of needs but they can

00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:16,870
now see what what's really cool there

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,850
and then switching cause again these

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,909
things they catch up with you they'll

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:25,000
take up with you fast it doesn't take

00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:26,740
too much too much pressure from the

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,890
National along with vulnerability

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:35,049
database or some sort of community level

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:40,000
challenge to create huge amount of

00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:42,460
disruption the supply chain so would you

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,710
need to be able to do is to promote a

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,770
level of flexibility and optionality

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:50,590
people have to make decisions they going

00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:53,380
to choose projects understanding those

00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:57,400
motivations and being invested in those

00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,470
projects actually allow them to reduce

00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,179
the switching colors because they know

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,179
why they chose something they know what

00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:07,990
features are using they may have patched

00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:11,500
features thinking they know how it needs

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,470
to work to get the job done

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,950
those those XS have a knowledge it's

00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:20,890
incredibly valuable because it allows

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,690
you if something is disruptive for you

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,540
to be able to switch off and find an

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:29,690
alternative in a much lower time much

00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:32,180
or tighter timeline then if it was just

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:38,000
in a black box that you were essentially

00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:46,190
consuming so there's some super value

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,940
there in the last one Blackman so this

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:52,370
is kind of an underlying one is that

00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:58,700
open sources an outcome it's something

00:32:52,370 --> 00:33:01,250
you do is a result it's a product it's

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:05,450
not a strategy and again it's a myth

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:10,730
that I find is very prevalent and it

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:15,470
really is an overall problem with teams

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:19,250
because when they approach the project

00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,410
they treat it like a commodity and they

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,570
just wanted to derive as much value from

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,870
it as they can without actually thinking

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:30,950
about viability and then move on and

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:34,190
that doesn't work so when you start

00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:37,310
thinking about open source and open

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:40,190
collaboration as a strategy how you're

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:44,060
going to approach the next big problem

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:48,580
that you have it really does change the

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:51,560
entire narrative on how you do business

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:55,370
because the willingness of working in

00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:58,010
sortsa to find foundations to invest in

00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,080
common answers that allow you to still

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,840
have your distinctive competencies I

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,030
don't think it's some magic everything's

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,720
not going to be available everyone's all

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:11,929
at the platform strategy but we don't

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,880
need so much friction between the

00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:18,919
platforms that it's so expensive and it

00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,710
makes getting that talent so much more

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,780
of a challenge because we have to build

00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,060
it up again and again and again and

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,050
again everybody does something just

00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:33,140
different enough we can find these

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:35,330
better answers again we're old friends

00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,940
easier we're all competing against each

00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,169
other for fights listening

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,639
or fighting for the same market position

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:44,319
but that shouldn't necessarily come at

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,069
the expense of finding some better

00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:51,700
answers to allow us the firm's to find

00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:54,069
what are we the best act what is really

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,819
undifferentiated that's the stuff we can

00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:59,710
we can handle at the consortium and then

00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,930
we can build upon it to reflect our

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:07,349
unique value what if people looked at

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:09,940
our brands to get done and it's not some

00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:13,569
advanced container security system for

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,040
kubernetes I know no one calls up that

00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,780
elleny instead its head and thinking

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,520
about open a broker's account tell me

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,980
about your container security strategy

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,270
that's not their first thing it is

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:28,630
really important but it's not the thing

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,760
that's going to drive in a business and

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,730
we need to be able to say okay cool

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,380
exactly drive business fantastic doesn't

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:37,089
mean it's not important we have to

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,980
invest in it let's let's try to find

00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,619
those common answers to make it less

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:46,660
expensive for all of us

00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:49,030
no consistency and that again generally

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,040
raves all ships so that we can better

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:55,560
meet that new account

00:35:51,040 --> 00:36:00,970
opener or whomever is coming to us for

00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:05,290
cool topic and that's it the open cycle

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:12,400
at the end but ignore that one that was

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:13,210
it folks find it helpful yeah that's

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,210
great thank you

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,670
um there must be some questions if not

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:21,880
I'll jump in with some but does does

00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,240
anyone on the line have questions for

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,240
Justin

00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:38,150
I'll dive in here is rich from Freddie

00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,710
Mac any suggestions on on a github

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:42,650
policy well you want things that we

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,170
struggle with is how accessible to make

00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,930
it you know security wants to lock the

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,910
whole thing and in fact has done that

00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:51,320
developers want to get access everything

00:36:48,910 --> 00:37:05,390
do you have a strategy on on how you

00:36:51,320 --> 00:37:07,490
manage that or any suggestions or how do

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,960
we know what people are using Nigel but

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:13,910
knows not gold less and they go oh

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:16,790
that's bad so it goes back to that kind

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,849
of process so what I would say is make

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:22,820
sure again really lean on policy what's

00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:26,180
the process you can do try to find those

00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,580
trade-offs again in some way find the

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,640
most interested parties get it in a room

00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,520
together has it have a subset a slice of

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,430
your developers talk to why they want to

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,359
do things have a security folks talk

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,270
about what things they're concerned

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,300
about and then see hey can we come with

00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:48,890
them some common answer that's basic a

00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:49,339
101 you can't eliminate risk it's just

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,190
not

00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:54,770
I don't Lee it's a healthy goal but

00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:57,050
there's ways that the teams if they talk

00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:00,020
together can one recognize that the

00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:04,760
other people's motivations are not about

00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,900
just locking everything down but also a

00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,700
buildup what are those shared

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,750
responsibilities what are the things the

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:14,240
developers have to do to promote the

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,089
needs of the firm and potentially the

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,580
auditor compliance of security folks and

00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:23,000
then reflect that back in the tool some

00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:27,980
tools doing better than others give up

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,320
hard because you're trying to balance an

00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:34,760
intranet and Internet and there's known

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,880
that gateway so but I think there's a

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,290
lot of stuff when it

00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:43,350
now teams as basic features about how

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,480
you change his ability on a repo in

00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:48,000
being able to talk to that control to

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,680
your security and say hey I'm I had the

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,070
organization owner the only one to make

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,680
this change this is how he will request

00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:58,050
it this is how we fulfill it this is

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,410
where the audit log is and this is what

00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:03,060
happens when it's done and the security

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,160
codes we'll be really happy that we have

00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:11,370
a public repo with source code in and

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,990
who's caring but you can do it and the

00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,160
developer won't you super happy about it

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,290
because they just want to be able to go

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,960
in and just change the setting to to

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:23,790
public org has never done private so

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,110
again it's it's finding that a level of

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:30,300
middle ground in that's the Oxbow role

00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:32,610
that's that kind of broker of subject

00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,450
matter expertise for risk compliance

00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:38,100
developer experience all nine yards to

00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:44,520
hopefully bring that people back to a

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:49,110
common common answer that helped yeah

00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:53,730
thank you very much what does the

00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:57,770
governance look like at fidelity and how

00:39:53,730 --> 00:40:00,900
do you avoid the accidental

00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:05,790
communication of information that should

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:11,970
be maintained as a proprietary piece of

00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:14,880
information so I mean I try to have

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:17,600
lightweight governance essentially I

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,880
like black this I don't like white list

00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:24,630
so people know what are rejected

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,750
licenses and the tools that we'll look

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:30,660
at what they're doing and tell them

00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:34,140
early on hey you're trying to use

00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:37,170
something that doesn't align with policy

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,090
find something else and they may still

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:43,770
call me up and say hey I'm getting this

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:47,760
I'm you know but really trying to be

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:49,260
very narrow with with policy and goriias

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,130
because you tried

00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,380
to poke holes eventually to allow

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:58,290
certain things through a screen door on

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,900
a submarine and you have the worst of

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,030
both of both sides of the equation it

00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:07,080
becomes really important to focus on

00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:10,820
what a material risk and what's cost of

00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:13,560
doing business put in contextual terms

00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,810
get some sign-off from appropriate

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,400
parties and say hey I can't eliminate

00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:23,030
risk here here's my risk reduction see

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,160
if they buy it out of the conversation

00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,110
if they if they go back I needs

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,540
refinement in this area at least you're

00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,130
working from something some specifics

00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:36,960
and you I need tighter controls around

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:40,290
the audit logging I can do that I can't

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,340
say hey how do we make sure that no one

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:47,280
can do anything

00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:49,530
instead and that can do that so really

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,150
being precise and again they're going to

00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,790
come at you with me beyond the boil the

00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,530
ocean problems how do I make sure that

00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:58,140
someone doesn't take some source code

00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:02,370
and put it in to get up into a private

00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:06,510
github repo well even if you were to

00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:09,570
blacklist the domain on your proxy it

00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,160
doesn't stop them creative people will

00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:16,110
work around that and that's a bunch of

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:17,790
creative ways to do that so I have a

00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:22,290
different presentation I've done a

00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:24,600
couple times around desired paths if

00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,500
people know what desired paths are it's

00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,630
kind of when you're looking at a

00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,490
sidewalk and you see what they've come

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:35,360
to the right angle and you'll see that

00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:37,920
kind of dirt trail between two areas and

00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,250
when you come down to developers there

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,700
they're looking for a police resistance

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:46,350
but if it doesn't cost them too much

00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,360
they're gonna walk on the sidewalk they

00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:52,830
don't want money shoes and you want to

00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,620
be able to look at that kind of desired

00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:58,950
path it see where they're showing up and

00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:01,050
then look to see okay can I can i guide

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,000
that one should I have a sidewalk

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,940
barrier or

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,900
- can I make using the sidewalk less

00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,810
costly for them and again a little

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,940
little nuance there but you want to look

00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,030
at the results having conversation with

00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,760
developers and again it's very very

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,100
clear that you can't prevent it outside

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,630
of doing like trenches where no one can

00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,920
go outside it and what that will cost no

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,930
one's going to want to work at a firm

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,660
that feels like you're just walking down

00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:39,510
a trench and you can't actually see all

00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:41,760
the things that are going on because you

00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,200
can't it can't shelter that because

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,530
again because I'm an innovation

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,820
perspective and a community perspective

00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:52,860
you're gonna die and nobody wants that

00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,440
so that's again part of the optimal role

00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:58,620
is to be able to communicate some of

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,630
that to the business saying hey you need

00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,240
to accept some risk here I'm saying it's

00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:05,820
not without risk but this is a reward

00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,740
this is what our goals are this is how

00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,770
we can measure it this is how we can

00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:14,760
secure it this is our control portfolio

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:17,070
this is our audit blocking and when

00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,490
something happens because something will

00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:23,040
happen you'd be able to respond to it

00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:25,430
and say yep I missed that I'm gonna do

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,300
better this is how I'm gonna do better

00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:33,450
it really just kind of hone it and not

00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:36,980
pity points fingers at somebody else and

00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:39,510
hopefully it's a minor thing hopefully

00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,720
but again it's really that

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,790
accountability on behalf of the firm

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,740
they're saying hey I'm gonna stand with

00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,690
the developers doing because I believe

00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,610
they're going to do the right thing they

00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,650
want to do the right thing

00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:55,110
how can I help them do the right thing

00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:58,580
and how can i within reason

00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:01,620
help them avoid doing the wrong things

00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:05,870
from from the perspective of a moderator

00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:11,370
of an open source project at a financial

00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:15,780
institution what guidance or is there

00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:20,340
guidance for helping Madhuri

00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:32,970
there's draw the line between openness

00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:35,820
and control so if you're going to have

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:38,430
three maintains of externally one of a

00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:41,400
good conduct set some ground rules in

00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,840
how people can respond if they see

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,590
something that's problematic because

00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,350
your brand is on the line there so you

00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,960
have kind of a two two level thing where

00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,610
first you gotta set some ground rules on

00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,030
what community management looks like

00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,470
your your organization use somebody

00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:04,320
else's code of conduct don't create your

00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:07,170
own or at least minor risks on it and I

00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:12,300
think there's a lot of good examples out

00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:14,730
there but on then that that's kind of a

00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:19,290
boilerplate that invite people in and

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:20,790
then as maintainer x' doing some form of

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,530
Education what's appropriate

00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:26,460
communication what stalking

00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:29,550
implementation for its de patterns being

00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,790
in mold so especially those early days

00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,560
with with a with a new maintainer keep

00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,330
watching the issues how are they

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,780
responding are they responding in a way

00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:42,000
that could be a little gray and then I

00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,290
don't have a sidebar and say hey I saw

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,860
you trying to help out come to you open

00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:51,510
an issue on the repo or we're doing a

00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:55,190
pull request yeah I think we need to

00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:57,920
work on that but be specific again

00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:02,000
active easy had to get there and say hey

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:09,450
if this doesn't it just continues one

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:12,780
reflecting Magli on the firm but also it

00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,880
has a threat to we're going to close

00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:18,390
this repo down archive whatever the case

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,920
may be because we don't have the

00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,790
appropriate maintainer ship and that

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,040
also comes down to the abandonment side

00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,340
one one thing amount of a big advocate

00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,190
for working upstream

00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:32,380
for our associates more than writing a

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:37,120
new thing and putting it on our public

00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:39,580
org we don't do that but I really

00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,590
challenge teams to look at invest in

00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,930
existing projects rather than creating

00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:47,410
new ones and I really just come down to

00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:50,260
calls the doing community may have been

00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,480
responding to issues as a team at the

00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,950
fidelity team it comes with a pretty

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:59,710
significant cost and a lot of complexity

00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:02,010
and I think there's often times we're

00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:04,270
not unique in the marketplace so

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,070
somebody else can do that and again and

00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,530
you can still potentially be a

00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,750
maintainer on that project on that

00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,750
external project but you're part of many

00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:20,380
if you're one of many and that really

00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:28,510
allows for better scalability been

00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:30,250
answered thank you thank you the joys of

00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:33,100
what things they can talk about what

00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:36,880
they can but when it comes down to best

00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:48,220
practices again being clear and concise

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:51,070
I think really helps people do this what

00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:56,800
happened a problem I asked the audience

00:48:51,070 --> 00:49:08,730
hold on do you see you're using myth

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:13,860
within your organization yes definitely

00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:16,770
good like no one's looking know

00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:19,090
everybody understand everything and

00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,960
again it's all there for a reason and

00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,960
it's all modern and good

00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,610
Justin in a big organization how what

00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,190
are some of the ways I come across

00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,420
sometimes you did you have an open

00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,100
source pause here or a large

00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,870
organization has an open source policy

00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,370
and maybe it's not perfect maybe it's on

00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,260
its second iteration and not yet its

00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:48,000
third and maybe all of the workflows

00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,010
aren't fully around it but there is a

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,380
policy how do you make sure that people

00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,360
know that given it as you mentioned

00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,930
organizations are often siloed and can

00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:03,990
have you know thousands of developers or

00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:06,810
software engineers is it internal

00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:08,550
marketing is it you know making sure

00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:13,260
that you're in internal newsletters on

00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:14,490
the intranet site going to team meetings

00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:26,400
what are some of the things that you

00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:28,590
think have worked best there's always

00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,230
the subcultures yeah some folks are like

00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,950
they just let everything out all the way

00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:37,500
down Jude did you put it on the teletype

00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:39,330
so you want to be able to have those

00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,270
conversations so one of the most

00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:44,880
valuable things I found when it comes

00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:48,590
down to communication has been being in

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,700
those team meetings being a stand-up and

00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,650
talking about it usually is because

00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:55,050
somebody said hey wouldn't it be cool

00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:58,560
with open sources or we got a thing an

00:50:55,050 --> 00:51:01,290
open up sort of upstream project and

00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,950
then being the best partner who is that

00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:05,070
person

00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:07,890
because they will be here scalability so

00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:10,920
when somebody else in another team says

00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:15,210
hey I ended up trading oh we talked to

00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:18,600
Justin maybe he can help you out and you

00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:20,940
get the kind of invites policy is

00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:24,770
important giving people a place to go is

00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:27,060
really helpful our intranet are large

00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:30,300
and on character running at Google

00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,860
appliance indexes don't buy you very

00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,090
much because people usually won't go

00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,590
look for them you know they have a

00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:38,490
problem we do have mandatory education

00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,380
so

00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:43,560
I'm sure everybody does for for

00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,900
different topics so this is a topic that

00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:50,880
I try to assign you to those who deal

00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:53,760
with software so it's basic open source

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,859
literacy although I am trying to work

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,440
with other folks so to make it a let's

00:51:55,859 --> 00:52:01,070
call it an industry-wide standard rather

00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,310
than just our bespoke opinion

00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:07,220
so what's basic open source literacy

00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:10,920
what if we're our apologies we're

00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,119
processing documented because again

00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,099
those things are gonna change and image

00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:17,339
change quickly so having to redo your

00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:19,859
education portfolio or compensate your

00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:22,230
policy documents on a frequent basis

00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:25,650
that's not going to work if you want to

00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:28,260
give people pointers no don't send my

00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,720
value but actually keep people a place

00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,660
to go to find out what is the freshest

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,940
and then capable voice so from that

00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,540
social knowledge perspective what things

00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,530
are working

00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:42,780
what are opportunities they become

00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:48,060
invested in the process getting better

00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,980
so one it reduces alone on your also but

00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,080
also they're invested in making the

00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:57,839
process meet their needs

00:52:52,080 --> 00:53:03,240
and then your job is less my way of the

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:06,150
highway but really in just establishing

00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,490
those relationships and distilling those

00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:12,830
multiple opinions into one process that

00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:12,830
hopefully works the best for everybody

00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:24,740
cool I'm gonna kick out of the room in

00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:28,109
about a minute if folks need to find me

00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:30,140
I'm sure my email gap comprising of my

00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:34,410
email and pushing us out of my email

00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:35,849
track me down I tend to go to a lot of

00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:39,119
ends especially the foundation ones

00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:41,609
that's one of my responsibilities but

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:45,630
you have any questions if people have

00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:48,700
ideas I'd love to try to figure out

00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:50,950
more common answers I don't think we're

00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:54,910
special and special actually it's pretty

00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:58,090
expensive so I mean honestly the to do

00:53:54,910 --> 00:54:00,430
group I think is a good forum to do that

00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:04,690
is just breaking into whether they is

00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:07,450
more control centric apartment players

00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:11,710
but it does provide a little bit of a

00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:17,740
neutral play playing ground to put some

00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:18,700
of these ideas out there that's great

00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,060
thank you so much

00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:24,400

00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:27,300
great presentation and I'm sure we'll
