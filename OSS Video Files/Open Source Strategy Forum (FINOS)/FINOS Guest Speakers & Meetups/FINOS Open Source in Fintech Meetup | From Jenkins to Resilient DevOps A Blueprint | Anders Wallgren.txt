a little bit with our with our customers

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
especially with

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,079
with a focus on on the the finance area

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
um

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,119
where where cloud b started was was with

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,759
jenkins

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,319
um you know we we are the company that

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
um

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,400
offers the you know the commercial

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,040
version of jenkins if you will as as one

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
of our

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,680
uh several product offerings and uh and

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
that's where we we started and

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
and i think to this day we we you know

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,920
maintain the highest

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,879
amount of commits to the to the jenkins

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
project

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,480
out there because obviously a lot of

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,239
folks who work on the project uh work

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
for uh workflow for cloudbees in

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
addition to the

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,959
the vast parts of the community that

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
also uh contribute uh to

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,680
to that to that project but you know

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
very early on we've we've worked with

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
uh companies in in the financial

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
services area and

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,440
and also at my my former company which

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
which uh joined uh cloudbees about 18

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
months ago we've we've worked for many

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
years

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
with with the financial uh industry kind

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
of solving problems and

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
i'm not going to read these quotes to

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,959
you because i always feel awkward

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
reading other people's quotes but

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
you know people say nice things about us

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920
i guess is what i'll say um

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,920
you know and and we like to work with

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,360
this industry because it it brings a lot

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
of rigor and thought and

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
and uh uh and and and those kinds of

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
interesting things uh to to the problem

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
and

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,319
and that's kind of fun to to work with

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
and it's been a you know it's been a

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,560
kind of a wild journey for

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
for jenkins and and for cloud bees um

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,959
you know the

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
the graph on the left is sort of the

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,920
definition of up and to the right

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
uh if you will um you know the the

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,680
number of

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,360
um uh jenkins servers out there in the

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,360
world and these are just the ones that

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,239
you know kind of are not sitting behind

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
firewalls and and we don't know about um

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
or

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
yeah are are it's huge and and the

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
analysts

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
um you know speak to uh to the

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
performance and and the strategy that

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,280
that

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
we bring to that problem now

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
financial industry you know has an

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
interesting set of dynamics you know

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
there are many industries out there that

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
that are kind of unique and

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,599
and interesting and finances is

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,720
definitely one of them and there are

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,560
several lenses through which uh

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,319
financial companies look at their

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
digital transformation and you know sort

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,080
of life in general but

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,640
speaking specifically to to the idea of

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,799
digital transformations

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
one of the unique aspects is governance

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,959
right i mean the the

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,919
the governance is always top of mind in

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
in finance

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,720
and um you know how do we assure

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
separation of duties which is kind of

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
the phrase we use in

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
in the us although i don't believe that

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,560
actually appears in any of the laws

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
um but but the notion of you know keep

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
keep the developers out of production

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,560
and keep the ops people out of the code

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
um you know that that that sort of thing

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,280
um how do we enforce

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
controls um how do we make sure that

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
only the right people

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
are committing only the right people are

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
pushing into production

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
um how do we make sure that all the

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,960
right things happen

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,520
before we push into production

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,720
how do we you know how do we ensure that

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
that we have the right governance in

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
place the right controls in place all of

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,440
those things

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
most companies would would say that they

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
those are always important if even if

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
you're not a bank even if you're not a

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
large financial institution or a small

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,840
financial institution but the truth is

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,520
for for for

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,039
for uh for finance it's different you

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
know because people go to jail

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
ultimately if they don't do these things

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
right uh and and if they're not done

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
right they can also be

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
quite quite quite an existential problem

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
for

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,199
for companies uh so that's definitely

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
one of the one of the lenses that the

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
industry looks at at digital

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,000
transformations

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,479
second thing is adaptability finance has

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
historically you know obviously

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,400
financial industry has been around

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
for you know hundreds of years uh this

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
is something that's just been a basic

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,600
part of human life for for a long time

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
but it's also been um an early adopter

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
of

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,759
technologies um you know moving from uh

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
pen and paper

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,240
ledgers uh to computers uh happened you

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,639
know fairly early and

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
um the the the financial industries

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,120
trading companies in particular

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,440
historically were large voracious

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,240
consumers of of technology and

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
and quite innovative uh in technology as

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
as well

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
but as you you know as we all go along

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
and as

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
technologies change and evolve that does

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,639
leave

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,160
a financial industry with an interesting

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
you know kind of conundrum that you know

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
to some extent we all have which is

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
technologies change very fast what do we

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,560
do with the old technologies

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
um you know the the the mainframes are

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,479
still in use the

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,120
the 1980s technology is still in use the

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,160
client server 1990s technology is

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
is still in use web 1.0 still in use you

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
know

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,240
all of these things are still out there

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
we don't retire products just because

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
the technology we built them on

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
is not the technology we would use to

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,319
rebuild it if we were rebuilding it

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
today

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,960
and of course we don't go rebuild

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
everything every time there's a new

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,880
technology switch that would be

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,960
a little bit like you know raising all

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,400
the buildings and rebuilding them every

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
time there's a change in the building

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
code

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,800
we obviously don't do that we retrofit

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
when we're needed and necessary but

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,840
you know we don't go rebuild every

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,280
building every time there's a there's a

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
new type of concrete or

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,199
a new way of building a joist or or or

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
something like that

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,240
so so but we have to adapt to new

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
technologies and we have to

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,639
we have to make them work uh with the

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,280
existing technologies that we have and

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,080
that that's definitely a challenge uh

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
that that

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,160
that most people in most industries will

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
have with digital transformations but i

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,039
think in finance

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
given the focus on technology over the

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,080
years it's it's especially uh

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,960
especially apt um scalability is is

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
is absolutely you know uh top of mind as

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
well

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
in terms of working across geographies

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,280
working across

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,120
teams hundreds if not thousands of

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
applications and environments that need

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
to be managed

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
and how do we how do we do that and

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
still get the velocity

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
uh that the business requires in terms

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
of our software delivery

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,599
and of course the reliability that we're

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
all expecting uh

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,199
because you know i know when i walk up

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
to the atm i would very much like it to

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,479
work and give me the money

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,879
that i need or when i'm paying for my

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,199
groceries uh at the checkout lane i

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
very much want everything to work so

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,440
reliability is is

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,879
obviously a a very big deal not again

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,160
not that it's not a big deal in other

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
industries but uh

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
but uh it tends to get noticed a lot

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
more quickly

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,639
and a lot more seriously when you when

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
you can't access your money people take

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,759
that personally

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
and then last on on this slide

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,320
manageability um

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,039
how can i keep all my teams happy how

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,120
can i speed up our releases

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,880
how can i what sort of analytics do i

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,360
want to look at what sort of metrics do

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,839
i want to use uh in order to kind of

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
identify issues or maybe you know work

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
and work with improve

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
compliance uh with all my governance

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
those sorts of things so

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,720
these are the lenses that that in our

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
experience

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
the finance industry kind of looks at

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,279
software looks at

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,360
the digital transformations uh through

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
and and there are challenges i mean you

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
know some of these are unique to the

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
industry and

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,480
and some of them aren't um you know

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
disruption

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
uh mergers pivots um you know the

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,360
financial sector is certainly no

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,760
stranger to disruption um and and

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,880
that obviously isn't going to change um

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,320
there's there's a slide

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,240
that i haven't included in the deck

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
today but it was uh it was made by

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
venture capital for a minute it shows

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
the homepage of a big u.s bank

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,800
and then around it are raid 90

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,800
startups that are trying to

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,880
basically eat away at various parts of

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
this large bank's

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,640
business and basically the logos of

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
these 90 uh uh

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
companies all have a little arrow

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
pointing to the part on the home page of

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,720
the large bank

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,839
of the part of that bank's business that

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,880
it's you know trying to trying to

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,920
disrupt

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
so uh you know even even 100 200 300

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,200
year old

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,320
uh institutions are are you know being

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,560
challenged by

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,000
by upstarts um and mergers and

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
acquisitions are a fact of life of

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
course the finance industry is the

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
driver of that

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,279
in other industries and of course sort

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
of the subject of of that itself

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,200
as as as we see and and those are

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,959
complicated things you know when when

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
you merge large companies

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,360
that have large infrastructure um that

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,959
is a complicated thing and

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
again not unique to finance you look at

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,640
the airline industry for example

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,640
um united airlines and continental

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,360
airlines when when they merged it was

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
probably half a decade uh before the the

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
technical

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,519
systems aspects of those mergers were of

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,320
that merger was all ironed out

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
um it takes a long time to do these

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
things

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
um and you know patience is is required

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
and

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,760
resilience is required and innovation is

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,440
required to

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,200
to do that um the the

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,360
you know and in some places in in the

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
world entire technology generations are

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,079
being skipped

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,839
um you know large parts of the world

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,120
just skipped copper infrastructure

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
directly and and

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
and went to went to mobile uh and mobile

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
payment systems are

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,880
are dominant uh where where banking

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,160
isn't necessarily very dominant or

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
retail banking isn't

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,000
necessarily very very dominant for doing

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,920
you know micropayments and

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,440
and those sorts of things and and of

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,720
course you know new platforms new

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,040
back-end systems

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,560
new tools you know kubernetes serverless

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,959
microservices

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,640
all of these things are are are coming

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,240
coming on and of course

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
you know regulations are are

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,600
ever-present ever-changing

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,600
ever-evolving ever unclear um or

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
or or too specific or not specific

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
enough you know all of these kinds of

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
challenges that we face

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
and then around all of this is process

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
and and and of course financial

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
institutions

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
have to be great at process by

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
definition you know you

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,920
you will not survive very long as a

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,800
financial institution if you don't pay

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,880
attention to

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,079
to your processes and and it's really

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
the you know the

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
the the business you know is the

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,279
lifeblood of the of the world's economy

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
it just has to work it has to be

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,320
accurate

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
it has to be secure it has to be well

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
understood

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
to be all of those things and um you

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
know what's happened

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,480
over the last 40 years since kind of the

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,040
beginning of the information technology

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
uh era um you know all of the layers of

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,519
processes have been built on top of each

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,240
other

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
you know bank a buys bank b they both do

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
things differently

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
um you know we can't retire one bank's

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,880
systems because

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,880
you know you just can't do that um so we

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,639
have to continue to work with both

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
systems and maybe over time try to

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,760
figure out how to how to merge them

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
together or how to retire one or the

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
other but but those are very difficult

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,279
things to do those aren't it isn't

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
it isn't clear that the right answer is

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,839
to just get rid of you know bank a's

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,839
systems and

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,320
and switch them over to bank b that may

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,079
not be practical or the timelines may be

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
very long for for being able

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,680
able to do that um these things are not

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,760
always very well documented you know

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,160
it's it's not like you can walk in

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,360
and and sort of know a priori all of the

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,120
systems that you have to deal with

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
before these things happen so so that's

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
definitely a a

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,920
challenge and then siloing and sprawl um

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
you know

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,720
we we we tend to we collect teams we

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
collect tools we collect locations

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
endpoints

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,519
you know vendors um you know the list

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
kind of goes on and on and on in terms

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,160
of the the

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
the amount of things that we have to

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
manage and and keep track of

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,839
and then you know we have to prove

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,920
compliance right we need evidence

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,079
uh of of compliance and evidence that

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
we're we're following the the governance

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,200
that that we're supposed to

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,440
and you know it's kind of hard enough to

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
do that by itself but as technology

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
evolves

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
and technology always leads law and

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
regulation

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,839
you have to sort of figure out well how

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,320
do we work this new technology

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,959
using old regulations and how do we work

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,959
with

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,560
regulatory bodies to evolve the

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,839
regulations in a way that makes sense

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,839
you know again that doesn't get too

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,360
specific and doesn't get too general

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,279
you know kind of goldilocks you know

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
just just right these are these are very

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
challenging

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,519
uh things to to work through and and and

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
then you know if

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,680
if that weren't enough and and you know

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,600
lately this is one of my favorite quotes

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,440
and this one i will read um there are

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,839
decades where nothing happens

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,720
and there are weeks where decades happen

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,560
um and

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,160
and that is a you know is a pretty apt

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
description of of what's been happening

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,800
for

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
for the last uh for the last nine months

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,560
to the world

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,760
with with the with the covus covid virus

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,519
and you know we've all had to adapt um

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,040
and and this has been this has been one

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
of those sort of watershed moments i

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,120
mean obviously this is a this is a once

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,360
in a hundred years kind of thing

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,880
uh happening you know quite literally if

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,760
we go back to 1918

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,399
and and the pandemic flew back then and

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,720
and it's been

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,839
incredibly disruptive it's disruptive

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,160
for families

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,079
it's disruptive for companies um all of

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,920
a sudden everybody's working from home

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
um so what is what is big you know what

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,440
has been a very familiar

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
literally and unstructured space now all

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
of a sudden becomes a very structured

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,720
space mom is working in

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
in one bedroom dad is working in the

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,839
kitchen um

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,360
child one is is trying to do school work

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,720
in the living room child two well there

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
isn't a room for childhood to do

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
anything so

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,519
you know this becomes very challenging

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,959
and and you know we all have to adapt

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
and this has been a stress

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,519
not just you know kind of

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
psychologically and personally for

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
everyone clearly

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
but but also for companies and

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,279
especially for companies that were

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
kind of 100 office based that all of a

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,639
sudden

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,800
almost literally overnight had to switch

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,800
and turn around to now be remote

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
you know we're all remote workers now uh

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
by and large uh

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,760
and and you know in in the case of

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
cloudbees i'll i'll sort of explain you

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,000
know we're a remote company to begin

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
with so

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
so to be frank that hasn't been

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,360
incredibly disruptive

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,120
uh for us because the vast majority of

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,240
our employees work from home

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,399
uh some worked in in in uh

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,320
in sharing spaces and and those sorts of

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,079
things but but by and large the the the

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
culture and the layout

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,360
of cloudbees as a company is we're

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,240
spread across i think it's 22

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,839
23 countries um so we're all remote and

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,759
kind of used to that so so that part

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
hasn't been very strange for us but

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,959
clearly it's been very new and strange

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
and stressful for

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,800
for for the vast majority of of

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
companies out there uh and it's you know

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
no

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,959
no discussion on this topic can't

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
acknowledge that and

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,839
and the role that it that it has played

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,519
recently in in what we're doing

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,040
so pivoting a little bit to sort of you

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,680
know talking about software software

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,399
delivery

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,040
um getting software out the door has

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,680
always been

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,320
a tricky thing um and and doing it at

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,639
scale

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,639
uh with governance in in complicated

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,120
industries with lots of different teams

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
is it's a complex problem you know the

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,519
there

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
we can talk about trying to simplify it

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,759
but uh you know it's never gonna get

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
that simple um that that that's just

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,680
that's just a fact of life at least not

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,360
in

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
not in my lifetime and probably not in

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,639
the lifetime of anybody

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,560
who's listening to me uh talk about this

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
right now um you know we we have a

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,399
multitude of teams

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,560
we have a multitude of applications uh

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
we have a multitude of processes that we

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,079
use to

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
you know to go from idea to production

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,560
to where our customers can can

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
can realize the value of of the software

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
that that we're creating

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,279
um and and and that's that's just

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
complicated right um

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,480
it's it's complicated to do um and then

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
you know

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
scaling this process and and dealing

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,079
with its complexity

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,480
all the different teams tools processes

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,880
and managing the risk around that

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
you know is it's just difficult like as

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
as things scale up

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,679
you start to lose visibility you start

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
to lose control

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
um you start to worry about governance

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,559
and and you know traditionally

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
uh the way to to kind of attempt to gain

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,439
back

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
visibility attempt to gain back control

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,160
and attempt to gain back

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,160
uh governance is to slow down uh is to

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
is to kill the pace right is this to put

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
lots

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,039
of structure in place to make sure that

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,360
you know we dot every eye

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,720
and cross every t every single time and

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,440
every step of the way

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,320
but that also kills productivity um um

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,160
ultimately

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,720
and and you know what what what

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,280
companies struggle with in in general

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
is you know how do we move fast and not

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,080
break things

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
um or at least not break things in

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,840
production right

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,640
um it's it's one thing for you know for

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,799
for uh for a social app uh to be down or

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
to have some problems you know boohoo

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,799
uh but you know again if i can't get to

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,120
my money uh i'm gonna be a little upset

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,720
uh so it's it's it's a different world

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,280
uh world that we live in

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
in finance and and you know this is just

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,240
a fact of of

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
modern software delivery in modern

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
enterprises

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
you know multiple teams multiple

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
processes multiple tools and

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,280
and and stacks and you know the the

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,160
the the technologies that that we bring

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
to bear on this

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,840
not just you know cloud b's technologies

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
but the industry in general in open

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,799
source

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,080
as well is is you know continuous

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,480
integration

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
building early building often providing

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
rapid feedback to developers that that

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,440
the changes that they've committed

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
are not you know are not are not

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
breaking things obviously

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
uh and then we also work with with

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,840
continuous delivery um kind of

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
downstream

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,200
from the continuous integration making

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,000
sure that we do follow on

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,360
tests for that you know the the the we

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
want to make sure that we have a

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,960
you know a straight path in into

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,960
production now you know that sounds

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
scary to a regulator that sounds scary

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,400
to a lot of people but but

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,640
you know truthfully the the more

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,120
automated we make things the easier we

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,039
make it to govern it quite frankly

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,480
we have to put the right gates in place

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,840
we have to make sure that we do all the

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,039
right things

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,000
but but generally when when you automate

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,840
things

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
you tend to take away the variability

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,760
and sort of the

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
the fallibility of humans and and and

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,200
you know we put computers to work doing

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,320
the repetitive tasks that need to be

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
done the same way

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,160
every time every day day in day out

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,160
uh and and and save you know save humans

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,200
for the more creative judgment

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,720
related processes um so and continuous

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,280
delivery is a core part of that you know

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
kind of

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,480
what what are all the things that we

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,880
need to do in order to

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,799
once we've built our software test it

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
qualify it you know get it out the door

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,520
and get it out the door part is

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,760
is release orchestration now if i'm

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,200
if i'm five people working in a garage

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
in a startup you know my release

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
orchestration

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,280
you know consists of somebody saying all

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,440
right i'm releasing um

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,960
obviously in in financial institutions

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,600
it's quite a bit more complicated than

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
that and

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,280
in most large enterprises it's it's it's

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,600
quite a bit more complicated than that

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
um there are coordination activities

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,360
that have to happen there are

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,640
you know we we we got to make sure that

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,720
you know compliance

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,240
is is being met when we do this release

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
do we have all the right disclaimers in

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,480
place do we have the right documentation

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,039
in place

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,640
have we done the right training um if if

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,320
we're changing our retail systems you

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,400
know are we rolling things out

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
uh and and are customers aware that it's

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,080
coming are our

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
employees aware that it's coming you

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,159
know you you can't just sort of

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,760
drop new things in on the world uh

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,360
unannounced and

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,880
you know that tends to be uh

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,159
historically part of part of release

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,159
orchestration

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
a new thing that that's happening which

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,880
is very exciting and and you know

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,280
something that that we have

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
products around is feature management um

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,760
one of the things that i

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,000
that i talk about in in the last year or

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,679
so is how we've we've gone

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,559
in in the last you know 15 years or so

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,960
from from uh you know if you go back you

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,559
know

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
say 20 years most software companies

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,640
were working on

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,480
12 18-month 24-month product cycles

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
you know you'd go a year or more between

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
releases that was the way things were

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,720
done back then

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,039
and that's too big um you know

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
a an 18-month release cycle is just

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
that's just too big that's a very large

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
batch size

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,520
it's fairly well known in the software

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
industry you know small batch sizes work

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,159
better agile works better you know these

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,720
kinds of things

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,240
but we we made a pivot you know 15 years

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
or so when we started doing continuous

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,400
integration

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,120
and at that point a lot of what we did

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
became about

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,360
the build um the build to build the

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,200
build is the build working is it running

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,400
are we doing the right things and and

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
the problem with that though is the

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
build is too small

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,960
um because a build is just that it's

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,960
just you know a set of changes that we

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
made to the code we've now built them

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,480
um that doesn't mean that we're done

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
that doesn't mean that what we built is

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
releasable

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,039
uh that doesn't mean that we sort of

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
have critical mass and in that bill to

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,360
tell the world hey we've got some new

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,600
stuff

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,520
um so so there's obviously something in

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,919
between that we have to worry about and

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,240
so

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,440
the goldilocks situation that that that

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,919
were that were in

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,679
in in the last few years is is these

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,320
18-month releases we used to do were too

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,640
big

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
and the builds that that we obsess over

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,200
correctly

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,760
are too small and and what we really

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,400
want to do and and kind of the the right

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,880
size of thing to worry about is features

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
um

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,480
and and and that's because that's the

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
that's the unit of value that we deliver

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,679
to our customers is features

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,159
you know and especially if you if you

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,919
take a a broad definition of the word

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
feature as you know fixing a bug is a

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,320
feature fixing a vulnerability as a

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
feature

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
adding new functionality is a feature

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
right

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,880
and and what we really care about is am

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,960
i ready to release this feature

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
am i ready to get this feature out out

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
the door not

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,919
is this build ready to go out the door

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,000
and not is this 18 months worth of

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,760
accumulated work uh ready to go out the

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,120
door so what we're seeing increasingly

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,880
in in the industry is

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,200
are our products around things like

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,200
feature flags being able to control the

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
runtime behavior of products

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,480
without redeploying so being able to

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,720
turn on turn off

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,320
functionality in in the software at

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,320
runtime in production

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,720
you know either for everyone or for

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,600
individual customers or for individual

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,400
regions

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,280
or to turn on an experiment and and

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,360
maybe run it

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,120
for a few people and and and you know

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,320
get results based on that and then maybe

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
continue the experiment maybe

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,080
discontinue the experiment

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,679
uh so so feature flagging is is

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
something that's becoming more prominent

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,080
and

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,240
and you know my opinion is we'll start

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,320
to focus more on features

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,840
as the thing that we want to manage

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,039
around not builds

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,559
not releases um in in in general what we

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,159
care about are are the features because

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,120
the second the feature is ready you want

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
to get it out the door

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,080
right you don't want to be beholden to

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,799
the other 12 features that are unrelated

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,840
uh to to to wait before you you uh you

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,120
you go out the door

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,720
and around this we have things like

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,200
value stream management which which is

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
really

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
you know mapping out and understanding

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,480
uh in detail

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,240
all of the things that you do to get

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,679
stuff out the door uh and

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,919
and that's a very important thing to

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,640
know how to do especially in a regulated

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,080
uh industry like lex offer so so how

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,679
does this relate and how does this bring

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,440
us then sort of in

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,919
you know nearing the conclusion here in

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,520
terms of of resilient devops right what

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,679
is resilient devops

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,039
um you know resilient devops is when

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,360
your organization can

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,240
confidently release new applications and

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,559
safely adapt

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
to change right and and you know you can

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,919
sort of substitute

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,760
features or bug releases or

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,279
vulnerability fixes for for releasing

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,200
new applications right can i

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,720
can i confidently push features

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,440
functionality out the door

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
can i adopt new technologies can i can i

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,799
make them work with existing

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,840
technologies can i do this at the speed

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,159
and scale

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,919
demanded by the business do i have the

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
analytics and the insight

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,159
to measure and improve my results on on

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,120
my software delivery process

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,039
am i able to prove compliance to to

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,679
governance regulations as part of doing

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,760
this

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
uh and can i you know instantly and

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
gracefully uh hopefully uh

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,840
respond to problems as they arise

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,679
whether they're um technical problems

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,360
vulnerabilities bug fixes or whether

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,159
they're business problems competitive

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,080
pressure

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,200
uh those sorts of things or or

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,679
existential

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
world issues like pandemics or financial

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,279
crises and

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,799
and and those sorts of things so so that

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,559
really is you know that that's the

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,000
the structure around which you know we

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,559
we we think around

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,559
our resilient devops and and how we how

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,960
we build products for that

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,919
so so uh you know when it kind of comes

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,840
down to it

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,000
um you know kind of what's the blueprint

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,880
for for resiliency well well model and

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,360
automate everything right because

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
if you if you automate something that

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,640
means you have understood it

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,240
uh that means you have looked at what it

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,440
is that you're doing and you have

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,520
codified it

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,360
right you you you have you have put that

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,440
into some form of code and

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,799
and and now it can be run repeatedly

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
over and over and over

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,080
and you don't have to worry about

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
somebody being you know sleep deprived

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,039
and skipping a step

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,320
accidentally or or you know rebooting

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,000
the wrong system or

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
or those sorts of things so automation

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
across the stack

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,000
is is is very important and and you know

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,600
one of the things i talk about in in

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,320
in front of you know anybody who listen

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,240
is is automation is auditing

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,080
um there's it's more subtle than that

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,679
but automation is a huge part of what's

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,320
what's what's what's involved in

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,200
auditing

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,400
if you think about auditing as document

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
what you do

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,279
and then prove that you do what you

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,360
documented and automation is

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,960
the definition of an automation is the

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,360
documentation

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,400
of of what you do and the runtime record

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,799
of an automation is

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,720
proof that you did what you documented

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,799
so so automation plays

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,400
a key role for for especially in the

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,200
financial industry

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
around uh governance and and regulations

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
and

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,360
and and those sorts of things another

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,400
important part of this resiliency is

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,400
is is self-service um providing

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
audit-ready pipelines and automation as

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
a service

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,120
um when you're when you're in a large

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,760
organization a large enterprise

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,360
you know if you have every single

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,039
organization every single team

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,640
doing things their own way well that's

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,640
chaos that's the wild west

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,919
now at the same time you don't want to

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,679
sort of clamp down and say

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,039
everybody has to do everything exactly

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,679
the same way because that's not

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,159
appropriate

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,720
either so so systems that provide things

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,240
like

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,240
self-service i have a new product or a

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,919
new service or a new microservice or a

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
new component that i'm building

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,760
and it's this kind of technology stack

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,880
and i need to set up a software delivery

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,960
pipeline for that

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
i need to do the ci aspect of it i need

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,039
to do the continuous delivery aspect of

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
it

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,480
i need to do the release automation and

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,640
the governance and and audit

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,000
and compliance aspects of it and and so

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,799
providing those things as

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
a self-service to your team members to

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,200
your

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,240
to your uh to to your uh to the people

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,880
building the software

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,919
is is key so kind of a self-service

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,159
catalog

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
of of things that you can do is

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,120
something that we found

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,320
very very powerful in in our products

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
and and very

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,760
you know highly adopted by our customers

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,840
in order to

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,760
to provide these kinds of things as

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,640
services to their own employees doing

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,120
this so that

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
the right way the governed way the

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,000
secure way is the easy way the default

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,120
way

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
uh very very very important and and you

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,919
know

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,600
being able to adopt new technologies

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,120
while still embracing what you have

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,720
right because again

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,799
you know new technologies come around

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,399
the corner just about every hour

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,080
right i mean there's a new shiny thing

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,159
every single day um

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,520
and and you know some of them are are

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,880
going to shine brightly for a week and

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,240
then go away and some of them are going

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,880
to be you know are going to be

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,480
uh changing the the landscape in which

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,080
in which we operate you know they some

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,960
of them become the water in which we

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,200
swim

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,399
to to some extent but at the same time

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
as i said earlier

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
you know we don't go out and throw out

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
all the old applications that we built

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,159
on you know traditional client service

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
systems or

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,520
traditional you know sort of older

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,399
mainframe technologies and those sorts

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,200
of things because

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,960
you just don't have the resources to go

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
rebuild the world

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
every time there's a new technology that

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,240
comes along so these things all have to

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,960
interoperate these things all have to

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,760
not be left behind um that's very

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,640
important and

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,240
and it's it's it's lovely it's lovely to

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,760
work in a world where everything is a

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,720
green field and everything is a blank

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,399
sheet of paper

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,559
and i get to use the new technologies

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,240
for everything but the reality is once

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,960
you have something once you have a

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,200
product

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,200
you now have to support it and and going

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,880
forward and in the case of of

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,320
you know many industries that means for

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,159
years for decades

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,320
very important to do that so you know

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,440
embrace don't replace

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,360
because you're not going to be able to

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,000
replace it's it's it's not

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
you know in in it's not practical uh to

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
go replace all the technologies all the

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,720
products that you have every time

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,399
something new comes along

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,360
you want to monitor and track releases

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,440
you know you want 360 degree visibility

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,320
as much as possible into everything

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,799
all your builds all your relief statuses

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
and

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,880
and especially you know what what is the

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,559
status of this feature where are we with

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,600
this feature are we ready to release

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,679
have we tested it

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,640
have we exposed customers to it have we

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,120
documented it

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
have we checked compliance you know all

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,399
of these kinds of things have to happen

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,159
you know where are the bottlenecks

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,720
where are we getting stuck you know in

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,360
in a if we do a value stream mapping of

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,880
of how things make it out the door where

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,120
are the bottlenecks you know where where

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,360
are we losing time where are we

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,159
delaying time to market uh just because

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,720
we have

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,640
you know a process bottleneck or a

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
tooling bottleneck or a culture

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
bottleneck

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,279
all of those kinds of things are very

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,640
important to to go after

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,480
uh and and do and and you know build in

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,679
security and compliance easy to say

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
difficult to do um but but you know this

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,159
is not something that's optional

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,520
um you know the the the you know

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,399
devsecops is is

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,760
is a very uh popular topic these days uh

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,760
you know some people like to say that's

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,519
really just devops always because the s

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,080
is silent in devsecops

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
um is is is the joke but but you know

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,000
reusable

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,039
kind of security first compliance first

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,120
pipelines

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,720
that are designed to to work across

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,200
teams across environments

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,480
across geographic locations are a very

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,519
key aspect and

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
you know kind of going back to

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,840
self-service if if

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,159
part of your your process involves hey

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,919
we if you're using containers

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,840
then all of your containers must be

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,159
scanned by this and that tool

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,919
uh before you go into this staging

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,039
environment or or this production

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
environment those sorts of things well

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,919
how do you make sure every

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
team is doing that well one of the ways

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,960
that you can make sure that every team

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
is doing that is self-service pipelines

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
where by definition

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,000
the pipelines that they use that they

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,760
create come from

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,159
you know essentially a predefined a

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,399
preset a pre-approved if you will

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,080
set of pipelines that you can use now

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,880
you may have a team that that that comes

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,559
and says look

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,159
i've looked at the menu and nothing

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,000
that's on the menu fits what i'm doing

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,880
and that will happen and at that point

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,399
you know you you it's a judgment call do

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,760
you talk to that team and inspect them a

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,120
little bit closer and say yeah you think

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,159
you're different but you're not and let

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,760
me tell you why

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,200
or hey maybe we've discovered a new

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
thing that we got to put on the menu

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,240
just like when you well when we used to

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,919
go to restaurants

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,519
um you know you sometimes you order off

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,880
the menu but it takes longer it's a

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
little bit more difficult would you like

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
what

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
what you want as a restaurant is for

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,559
everybody to order off the menu so you

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
can

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,679
you can have the efficiency and the

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,039
known process of of going but

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,039
you know every once in a while new stuff

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,640
shows up you want to be able to

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,480
integrate and orchestrate all of the

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,720
testing all of the security

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,919
into that deliver delivery process the

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,159
development process

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,440
and have all the right you know approval

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,360
gates and checks

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,720
ideally automatic so we don't have to

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,799
all get in a room and

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,320
read offlines on a spreadsheet which a

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,840
computer is you know equally good at

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,000
doing and making sure that

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,240
if if the if if our if our governance

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,480
process says we will have x amount of

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,080
code coverage for example then you know

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,600
you you don't need a human to look at

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,519
the code coverage to decide whether it's

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,600
above a threshold or below a threshold

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,039
you can easily fail a pipeline

00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,919
automatically without having to get

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,720
humans in a room

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,000
uh to do that um again let the humans do

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,519
the creative judgment

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,519
aspects and let the computers do the

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,799
things that are that are easy wrote and

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,640
automatic and then you know you kind of

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,960
want to model and prepare for failure

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,039
um lots and lots of organizations kind

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,240
of set up their pipelines assuming that

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,000
everything will just succeed

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,679
well that's just not the real world you

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,399
know you have to model failure what

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,640
happens

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,559
if we fail at this stage where do we go

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,519
back to where do we kind of restart

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,039
things if

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,799
if we get into staging and we have a

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,640
problem do we go back to development

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,480
do we go back to qa do we re-roll the

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
build i mean these are all things that

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,480
we have to think about

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,440
and uh and and worry about to build

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,760
resilient

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,559
uh resilient devops resilient software

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,559
delivery

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,960
um you know what we want the outcomes

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,600
that we desire are we want agility

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
and control right we want portability

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,960
and

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,200
consistency um we we always and and

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,039
forever will want higher efficiency and

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,640
higher effectiveness

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,799
and of course we want to be secure and

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,760
compliant in the in the development

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,080
delivery and

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,000
and production of of our software and

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,039
you know club ease we we work with a

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,200
with a ton of

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,720
of uh of organizations in the financial

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,320
industry and and we love them as

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,119
customers because they bring us hard

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,800
problems

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,320
and we like to work on hard problems and

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,960
we like to solve them

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,399
um so i will i will uh i'll stop

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,079
bragging there

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,280
and stop and maybe we can do a little

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,359
bit of qa here so james back to you

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,399
hi anders um thank you very much for

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,879
your presentation

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,240
uh it was extremely engaging um before

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,639
we actually go

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,879
into the q a i'd like to announce the

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,240
winners of the finnos t-shirts

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:44,240
um so allow me to congratulate um dan

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,119
genovak um from cibc and carolyn

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,720
king from stream native um you've both

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,320
won a finnos t-shirt they will get

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,359
shipped to you

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,520
so we have time for one question um and

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,240
that question is actually from richard

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,280
um from kate think um and richard asks

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,119
asks

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
what are the greatest challenges you

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,000
face in your role related to open source

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,200
people processes resources or something

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,800
else

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,359
um all of the above quite frankly i mean

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,079
you know the industry the software

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,320
industry

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,119
you know stands on the shoulders of open

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,520
source

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,960
um you know we we you know cloud base is

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,079
is at heart a commercial software

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,240
company right we're

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,760
we're not a we're not a charity we're

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,720
you know we're in this to make money

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,720
but but we're also a huge supporter and

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,240
and we benefit massively

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,400
uh from from open source you know

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,280
jenkins being you know the the large

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,560
example there

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,480
uh uh clearly um but but

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,839
that involves a certain amount of you

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,640
know you have to you have to relinquish

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,119
control

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,040
um you know and and and you know the the

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,760
well-run open source projects in the

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,320
world

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,520
uh are are you know kind of owned in in

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
a legal

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,760
uh entitlement sense by by foundations

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,960
you know the linux foundation the

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
the c you know cdf the cncf you know all

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,560
of all of these various organizations

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,480
and so you have to be willing to work

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,680
and and kind of relinquish that part of

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,920
it uh

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,440
in order to be uh you know a good faith

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,480
uh corporate citizen

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,720
of of of the uh of the open source uh

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,480
community um so so i think the challenge

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,839
you know that that is a challenge uh not

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,640
specifically i would say for us because

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,000
i think we've been

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,599
you know we we work that angle i i think

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,680
with with all the various foundations

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,520
which we participate in and support and

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,280
and do those sorts of things but but you

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,800
know then then you don't you don't

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,680
control so if you know if we decided

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,440
tomorrow that

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,119
uh where if i decided tomorrow that oh i

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,320
want chance to do x y and z well i can't

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,079
just go do that

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,000
um you know i did we got to get

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,200
community buy-in for that so so

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,440
one of the challenges and this is

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,760
something that every kind of

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,480
mixed commercial and open source company

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,079
out there

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,760
you know faces uh you know someday is

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,520
the thing that we're building today is

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,119
it is it for the open source part of the

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,839
world or is it for the commercial part

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,760
of the world and

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,440
and you know that that that's part of

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,839
the nut that you have to crack and do

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
from a from a process perspective from a

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,119
cultural perspective

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,400
uh from a from a technical perspective

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,480
and and you know i

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,599
i think we do that you know every day

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,720
fairly well but you know there's

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,400
obviously days when those

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,480
those kinds of decisions are are

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,440
trickier um you know perhaps even

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,520
controversial

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,880
uh uh you know in terms of oh is this

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,000
something that that we contribute back

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,119
to open source or

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,680
or is this something that you know we

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
keep for ourselves uh uh

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,720
if you will so i think that's that's

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,560
part of the challenge of of

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,560
kind of working in in that in that

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,680
boundary between uh between commercial

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,680
and uh and open source

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,920
so that's great so we're at the end of

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,800
our time

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,480
on anders so i'd like to say thank you

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,960
very much to anders walgren

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,160
uh vp of technology strategy at

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,240
cloudbees

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,599
um for everybody who's asked a question

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,760
in the chat we'll make sure that

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,520
we get you on some answers and we'll get

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,520
those answers back to you

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,119
um and with that i'd like to say thank

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,640
you to everybody who's been on the call

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,960
today it's been phenomenal

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,839
thank you very much anders my pleasure
