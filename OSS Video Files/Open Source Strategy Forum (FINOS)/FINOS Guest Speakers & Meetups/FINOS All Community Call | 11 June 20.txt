periodic update and really a venue

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160

our contributors who are leading some of

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,000
the

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,559
most interesting projects that we have

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,960

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,680

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,840
the year

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,600
um there's a huge opportunity we think

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
with open sourcing financial services

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,360
this year and so i want to outline

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,280
where we are putting our focus

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
talking about focus as you might

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,200
remember earlier in the year we

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,360
introduced the concept of focus projects

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,720
which allows us you know out of the over

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,960
100 projects that we have in the

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,680
foundation to really hone in

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,320
on five or six projects every quarter

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
and help

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,799
as much as possible progress to deliver

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
value really produce valuable releases

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
out there

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,159
and finally a little bit of a roundup

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
around

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
some of the community and governance

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,799
initiatives

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,399
between me and james who would provide a

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
quick update and hopefully

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
keep the questions at the end but i you

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
know i would encourage you

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,280
if there's a really important question

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
to just jump in or put it in the chat

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,440
and we'll be able to go through it at

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,800
the end

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,920
great so um before we

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,480
jump in um you know

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,160
i wanted to acknowledge uh the very

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,000
particular situation that we're

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,000
living out there i think

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
you know especially here in the us we

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,200
went through

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,160
we are going through i think

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,879
very much the changes i wanted to remind

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
everyone

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,519
that finos is a welcoming

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,159
environment for everyone i i personally

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,400
think open source can provide

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
you know a level playing field in ways

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,519
that

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,640
very few

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
modes of collaboration can so please

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
make sure

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,239
that you help us uh you know keeping

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
a welcoming environment for everyone if

and you know moving forward as you know

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,319

our goals for diversity in our programs

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,599

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,440
um we will uh

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,040

we we achieve those goals and would love

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,760
space for everyone

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,920
moving on um

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,720
so much happened in in 2020 already um

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
despite as

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,040
as as i imagine many of you are at

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,519
home uh the the flow of time is a little

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,760
bit

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,400
bent by this quarantine but

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,920
when we look back so much already

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,199
happened this year

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,120
we welcomed three new members itau

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,960
adaptive and genesis and you know

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
we have a really strong pipeline for the

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
rest of the year

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
we announced the merger with the linux

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
foundation i'll give you a quick update

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
on that

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,800
in the next slide um of course we

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,919
transitioned

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,639
a lot of our you know

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,639
engagement opportunities to online

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,680
vehicles so we have now weekly meetups

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,040
we have this

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,360
quarterly call ongoing we have weekly

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,720
stream of blogs and newsletters in fact

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
make sure

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
in the first page i have collected some

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,759
call to action

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
for you folks make sure that you are

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,960
subscribed uh to our

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,039
lists and to our publications

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,840
uh as otherwise you might miss very

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,160
important information

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,759
but i think the most important angle and

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,759
what we're going to focus on today

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,840
is that we are seeing now a constant

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
organic stream of projects being

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,639
contributed to venus and increasingly

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
projects

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,039
that solve potential uh

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
you know pan industry issues um i think

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,520
i'm pretty proud

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,960
uh that we're seeing actually financial

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,400
institutions

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,080
uh increasingly uh uh taking the lead in

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,400
contributing this is a you know i think

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,199
a stark change for what we've seen

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
in the early days of the foundations and

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
i think one that

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
will ensure you know really longevity uh

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,520
to all our

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,600
initiatives so i want to send a shout

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,000
out to deutsche bank for doing the

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
second

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,880
main contribution walls will hear

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,680
from david the project lead today um

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,080
big shout out to citi uh as they have

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,039
completed their first major contribution

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,080
synthetic synthetic data data hub

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,680
project

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,319
and of course even though it's not a

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,080
bank a shout out to charter q

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,759
who contributed the secure electron

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,600
adapter earlier in the year

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
in addition to that we have the alloy

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,639
project which you know

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,479
has been announced last year and is now

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,600
now running several pilots you hear

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,639
about more

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,880
about that a little more from maitana

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,360
in terms of the plans and and what's

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,400
going to happen with that project

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
and our projects continue through sort

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,319
of maturing like

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,240
ftc 3 releases new standard we have a

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,360
reference implementation out there

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,280
an agent as well as

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,560
perspective became active so again we

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,319
uh might be a part but open source

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,960
continues to

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
deliver and actually i would say my hope

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,800
is that we

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,919
see an acceleration this summer so

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:13,039
that brings us to 34 members

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
almost 40 projects between incubating

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,560
and

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,680
active i think again

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,039
we will see these numbers continue to go

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,319
up throughout the year

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,120
uh and so i want to thank all of you for

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,840
believing in in venus and the power of

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
open source collaboration in this

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,680
industry

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,560
so one thing i want to

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,360
share with you and hopefully we're going

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,840
to do this every quarter and see this

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,520
continue growing but this is our

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,080
overall contribution snapshot

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,919
at this point in time in the community

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,560
if you're not familiar with it we have a

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,360
community dashboard on

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,759
metrics.tennos.org where you can go and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,199
have a look

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,360
my goal is to really

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,160
uh continue to see this line

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,599
growing and i think if you look at the

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
trends

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,400
you know we are right now experiencing

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,919
uh sort of coming back from christmas

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,879
uh still the the the the sort of

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,120
post christmas dip uh it's been a little

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,560
bit harder to recover from given

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,479
i think everyone uh attention being

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
heavily focused on kobe over the last

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
few months

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,320
um but that's where over summer that's

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,959
where we see the biggest spikes

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,880
so my hope is each one of you hopefully

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,080
will pick a project this summer to

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,440
contribute to

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
and we can see again our contributions

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,600
go up

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,680
uh above and beyond what we reached last

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,839
summer

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,000
um a quick update on the linux

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,680
foundation i'm already two minutes over

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,480
my time and we are working really

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,320
hard to complete the transition and make

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,720
sure that this is not

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,200
having any impact on the day-by-day

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,519
operation of the community

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
the goal is to close the transaction at

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,399
the end of this month

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,120
we are consolidating re-papering all the

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,040
members

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,640
into the new entity that we live under

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
the linux foundation

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,720
and the target is to have our first

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,000
governing board meeting

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,360
of the new finos directed fund under the

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,399
linux foundation

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,360
meet in july so

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,800
that's really when we can start i

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,120
wouldn't say start by

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
beginning the operational phase of the

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
migration we've done

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,720
a lot of preparation a lot of

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,160
investigation on how to best

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,080
merge our infrastructures and again

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,279
adding value to the community as you'll

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,959
hear in the next slides

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,560
but really it's going to be throughout

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,880
h2 that

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
you'll see many more of both

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,360
infrastructure

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,959
and again existing services

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,920
that the linux foundation offers surface

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
to the community

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
finally i've shown this slide in our

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,519
previous call

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,800
this is really a plug to say that a

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,160
we are working on updated

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
landscape over projects

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,839
you'll hear more about that as we have

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
these banded programs

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,000
soon we would love to get your feedback

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,519
and your help once we have a v1 will be

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,720
circulated with you folks

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,360
but the second point is have a look at

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
other linux foundation projects because

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
there's a lot of opportunity for

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,839
collaboration we are seeing

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
potential for upstream downstream

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,000
collaboration with hyperledger

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,920
with electron of course um so in case

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
you know there's any type of

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
collaboration with these other

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,040
foundations or projects

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,720
please don't hesitate to reach out we'll

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,600
be happy to make introductions and

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
explore

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,920
how we can best work together with other

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
established open source projects

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
i'm going to close on that just to give

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,240
you a

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
snapshot of the initiative that the team

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
is working on

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,839
above and beyond uh what you see

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,000
surfacing in projects um this is really

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,720
what we use

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
with the board to present our progress

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,519
uh it's in terms of the strategic

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
initiatives

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,160
um once you see in green are completed

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,320
we have recently rolled out

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,079
a new member benefits guide which you

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,240
can find online and really distinguish

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,440
value for the different tiers of our

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
membership

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,560
the same way we roll out the project

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
support guidelines

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,680
uh in this framework of focus projects

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,720
that allow us

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,360
as a team to really hone in on

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,279
you know how do we spend our time uh uh

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,920
on a day-by-day basis in supporting our

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,120
projects and providing a fair framework

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,440
uh uh for everyone and of course we had

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,040
to respond to kobit 19 that's been

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,959
a big part of at least the first

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,600
and initial part of the second quarter

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,959
from an ongoing standpoint of course the

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
the lf merger

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,240
is going to take some time for us

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,639
throughout the year

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,880
you'll hear it later today how we are

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,399
cleaning up our government's

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
post-program deprecation um

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
we are working on a training and

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
certification strategy

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,760
rob underwood is taking the lead from

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,560
our side there and see how we can

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,320
leverage dlf infrastructure to provide

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,240
training and certification capabilities

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,079
for our projects

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,920
so if you have interest on that please

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,519
reach out to rob

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,000
whether it is in producing training

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,920
delivering

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,519
training or taking training and finally

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
uh i think this is going to be a big one

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,079
moving forward we have started

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
initiative on open source financial

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,680
regulation

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
um it's very early days we've done a

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,600
webinar

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,959
we've launched the landing page we think

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
there is a huge potential for

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,279
collaboration

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,440
in the regulatory space where you know

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
there are typically non-competitive

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
there's simply non-competitive ip common

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
requirements so we really would love

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
your input

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,360
and and if you come across opportunities

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,399
where you think open source can help

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,480
implementation interpretation and really

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,000
enforcement

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,040
please let us know and with that

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,160
oops oops

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,279
this wasn't supposed to be a build sorry

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
about that

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
um i'm gonna move to the focus projects

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,880
which is i think the most important part

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,959
of today's presentation

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,000
as i mentioned throughout the year at

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,040
the beginning of the year we have

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
identified

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,199
with the board a framework to focus

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,240
on specific projects on a quarterly

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,480
basis

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,360
the board has deemed for q2

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
there are three focus projects alloy

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
morpher

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
and the initiative and devops

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,079
mutualization two incubating

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,160
focus projects and cloud service

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,000
certification and walls project

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,760
and then one active focus project so

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
again this will be changing on a

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
quarterly basis and we plan to provide

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,360
you updates without progress on a

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,680
quarterly basis on this project

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,399
and so without further ado i would like

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,440
to ask

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,199
aitana to provide us with an update on

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,880
the first focus projects the

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,959
alloy platform sure thanks cap

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,800
so as you all probably know the alloy

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,160
pilot started in december with a

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,040
preparatory phase phase

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,040
zero we are currently in phase one the

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,959
pilot phase that kicked off in january

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,959
and we're planning to start phase two in

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,560
the late summer which will mark the

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,000
commencement of the proper

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,920
fully open source project within finance

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
we've had very active participation of

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,560
course from goldman is

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,440
and gitlab so we're very thankful for

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,839
for their continuous work on the project

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,920
and

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
other pilot participants include finance

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,600
members deutsche bank

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,240
itau rbc morgan stanley

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,880
scott logic wells fargo and city and i

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,639
hope i didn't leave anyone out

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
and today i'm covering for rob who leads

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
this project this project

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
on the final side and i'll give an

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,959
update on the progress the alloy working

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
groups have made

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,920
and then i'll talk about how we'll get

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,920
from here to the actual open sourcing

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
so pilot participants are collaborating

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,079
on two working groups

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
the first one is focusing on fx options

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,399
and they've used alloy studio to model

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,560
various barrier related features and

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,920
submitted two changes to the fx options

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
cdm model

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,560
which was one of the milestones at the

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,720
first stage of this working groups plan

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,040
they're currently exploring life cycles

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,600
and relevant events associated with

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,440
vanilla options scenarios and a third

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
stage we'll be diving into more

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,240
exotic use cases and features which is

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,000
what they'll be working on from now

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,720
until mid-august the the group recently

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
had some

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,240
separate discussions with the securities

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,800
reference data project regarding

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,399
standardization of currency data

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
and exploring the creation of a

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,399
reference database solution for currency

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,680
data so stay tuned for

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,440
any forthcoming news on that

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,199
collaboration

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,040
and now on to the other working group

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,759
the commodity reference data working

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
group

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,800
is looking at two different angles one

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,360
is to establish commodities reference

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,839
data

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
model in alloy and the second angle is

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
to create a commodities payout within

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
the

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,759
vista architecture the initial work was

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,680
to review a vanilla use case of a single

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,040
period fixed float swap scenario which

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,480
is now being

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,160
extended to multiple periods and there's

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,800
also been discussions around qualifier

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,440
functions

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
in the cdm and again what's fantastic

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
here is that

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,160
this working group is also providing a

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,880
very good test of the overall

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,120
key goal of the pilot phase which is to

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,640
establish that not only can we use alloy

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,880
to collaborate among different

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,120
institutions but also that we

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,679
can take what's developed in alloy and

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,720
submit it back into a standards body in

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
this case

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,079
it's the cdm there has also been a

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,039
proposal spearheaded by wells fargo and

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,120
itau

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,400
to set up a third working group around

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,160
sustainability

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
and together with a set of other member

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
banks the group started exploring

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
business use cases and desired goals of

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,039
member organizations around

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
sustainability

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,440
um they also discussed carbon credits

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
carbon accounting and it is still to be

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,039
defined whether this group is going to

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
end up being a project

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,559
by itself or if they're going to use

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
alloy but please reach out if you'd like

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,160
to

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,919
join this conversation and finally

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
looking at next steps we've made good

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,559
progress on defining the roadmap for

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,799
alloy

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,120
we're working with goldman and we've now

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,880
got a high level work plan that we will

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,640
be publishing soon

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
on the alloy documentation side you can

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
see some of the screenshots here

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
and again we're now in phase one the

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,520
pilot phase and phase two the open

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,760
sourcing phase

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,440
is premised on the code uplift so

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,400
getting all of the alloy code into

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,000
github

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
and the next step would be the releasing

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
of the code so goldman is currently

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,960
working on getting the code ready then

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
we'll get it up to github probably in a

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,120
private repo for a bit

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,720
then stage it and and then convert it to

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,520
a public repo and that's when the code

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
release will happen

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,559
sorry in this first open sourcing wave

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,240
what's going to be released is the sclc

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,400
and then later in early 2021 we'd be

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
releasing the second wave of code which

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
would include

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,000
cube graph and services and as you can

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,520
see on the screenshots we're

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
linking the different deliverables and

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
milestones of the roadmap to the

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,720
corresponding issues in

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,480
github so you can all see how it's

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,240
working and moving forward

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,799
and the idea behind this is also to

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,720
start creating the structure

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,840
of alloy operating as an open source

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,919
project now

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,360
so that once we open source it we

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,440
already have some momentum

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
and are doing this kind of stuff in the

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,120
open source way

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,480
so that's it for lloyd today we're

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
really excited about the

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
great progress and please feel free to

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
reach out to rob or myself if you'd like

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
to get involved or if you have any

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,240
questions

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,679
hey tonic can i add just one thing sure

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
i just wanted to on the community

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,880
calling knowledge that itana is no

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,760
longer an intern

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,280
and now a full-time employee of finnos

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,679
has our

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,400
strategic initiatives she has been a

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,039
phenomenal ad to our foundation

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
and i just wanted to acknowledge that

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,240
and

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,679
please be nice to aitana because someday

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,320
not too long from now we'll all be

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
working for her

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:56,400
thanks rob thank you for chiming in and

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,240
thank you i i want to eco rob's world

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,679
you're doing a fantastic job and thank

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,320
you for the update

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,679
um on the alloy stuff i want to just say

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,799
i'm really excited

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,880
because um i think the potential here

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,400
not only for collaboration on the code

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
once it's going to be open source but

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,520
the very fact that we're hosting a

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,760
platform already where we're seeing

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,960
several working groups really spinning

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,000
on

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,880
spinning spinning up and addressing

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,640
real business problems it does really

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,679
bring together the connection of the

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
technology value

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,880
and the business value that if we think

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,360
open source can deliver

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,039
and that is very i think even more

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,520
fundamental for us as a vertical

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,640
financial services focus foundation so

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,080
so again kudos to the goldman team and

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799
you know thanks everyone who's

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,760
participating to the working groups

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,880
we see this being a very successful

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,080
ecosystem moving forward

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,960
thank you moving on

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,120
the next project is next focus project

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,280
information that we are exploring

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,840
is more fear so stephen you wanna

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,640
give us an update stephen goldman from

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
modern stanley

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,840
we have stephen on the line it is muted

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,480
hello am i unmuted yes we can hit you

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,760
how are you

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,039
okay i'm all right how are you good

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,039
great so uh more for morpher is a set of

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
tools for application modeling

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,960
and for modeling and working with

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,760
business logic

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
we found that it has good applicability

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,919
across our industry

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,600
and thought that this would be a great

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,480
open source

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,000
contribution as as mentioned we're in

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
the pre-formation stage

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,520
which means that we've done a series of

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
demos

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,360
we're happy to do more demos or discuss

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
this any further if anybody's interested

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
in talking to

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,600
us and uh

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,480
very excited in embracing the uh the

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,159
open source

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:12,000
model and the finnois model for this

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,799
so we're uh welcome to contributions the

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
link is on the

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,919
on the page here uh so anybody who's

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,559
interested

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,520
please go check that out and uh drop us

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,520
a line and let us know

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
that was thank you so much stephen i

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,480
really appreciate that

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,919
and um again it's great to see

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
as i was saying before financial

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,240
institutions uh uh

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
starting to lead the charge in terms of

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,200
of contribution and again

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,480
morpher is already an open source

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,320
project if you have the deck with you

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,280
you can click here on the link it's on

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,960
github the goal of course is

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
as we know it it's different to have a

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,760
project on github versus

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,440
bringing it under a foundation where

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,000
you know we create a level playing field

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,360
for all of our community

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,880
so hopefully uh

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,360
there is enough interest to bring this

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,559
project in and please if you have

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,480
uh interest out

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,240
we'd love to hear more from you uh we

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,000
think there is also potential

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,840
uh here for the open source finra

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,640
uh initiative that we are bringing

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,840
forward so thank you so much stephen

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
for the update

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,520
next on um devops mutualization

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,840
um this is uh an initiative that was

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,320
again actually brought up uh for

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,960
uh morgan staley board member dov katz

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,080
an actual

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,120
vice chair um so james director of

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,159
community do you wanna

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,440
take it away yeah um

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,880
absolutely so firstly it's really great

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
to see so many people on the call this

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,279
afternoon thank you

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,520
um everyone for being here so if you're

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,919
somebody like me who's been involved in

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,200
digital transformation within banking

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,320
um or has um a devops team you know that

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,799
actually works within

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,559
your engineering teams then um devops

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,600
mutualization will be a project that

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,400
you'll be

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,919
interested in knowing about um now if

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,039
you've worked within that space you'll

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,000
know the

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,039
efficiency quality and cost savings is

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,120
something that

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,120
every cto is actually trying to drive

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,520
out of their individual teams

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,279
um and what we found within finance is

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,799
that um devops is actually

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:34,000
um sometimes uh underrepresented

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,960
when it comes to what financial services

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,799
companies actually

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,919
need in order to drive more efficiency

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,720
out of those types of tools so

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,120
devops mutualization that i'm working

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
with

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,320
you know finnos team plus also dave and

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
other

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,919
famous members who have been invited to

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
the initial group

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,159
um is a way to solve common engineering

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
problems by

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,080
providing a continuous compliance and

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,559
assurance approach to devops that

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,679
mutually benefits banking

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,360
auditors regulators whilst also

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
accelerating devops adoption in

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,159
engineering and fintech i.t

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,320
departments so basically what we're

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,799
trying to do is make every engineer

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,799
more efficient by bringing those devops

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,360
tools devops skills and the way that you

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
either

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,080
report using common standards or

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,039
integrate using a common framework

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
um into the initial formation of the

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
project

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
so we can actually get um devops really

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,720
motivated

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,760
and motoring within um finance

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,320
um and so some of the um problems that

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
we're

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
suggesting or you know we've asked

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,159
people to suggest include

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,159
removing duplication of effort across

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,960
financial services engineering

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
um standardizing automated um audit

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,840
reports and

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,440
you know the reports that go to uh

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,440
regulators and you know

00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,120
internal auditors and auditing teams

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,880
um also um supplying financial services

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,200
integration requirements

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,679
into the people who actually engineer um

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,320
devops tools and so

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,960
devops mutualization is like a united

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,400
voice

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,440
um for fintech and banking um

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
now because we're forming this um with

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,559
um

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,000
finos members initially um we have

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,760
actually opened

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,279
a github issue that you can see at the

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,080
bottom of this slide

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,000
um which is within the community project

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,520
within the finos organization

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,679
um and it's issue 44 and so even though

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,640
this initial formation of this project

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
is being done

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,919
with you know members um within the

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
group

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,240
anyone can actually put their ideas and

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,559
thoughts into issue 44

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,000
and so feel free to go in there and put

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,480
down your thoughts about how we can make

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,159
devops more efficient in finance

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,919
and then i'll bring it into the group

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,679
and we'll discuss it and then we'll be

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,720
prioritizing our top two or three

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,880
initiatives

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,720
um or you can email me at jamesoncloud

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
finnos.org

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,400
so yeah i hope that um i hope that

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,640
explained devops mutualization

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
thank you james uh yeah it definitely

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
does and i

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,240
just want to add um

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,679
at this point we're really seeking for

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,600
you know initially you know an initial

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,720
charter for this group and really how

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,039
would

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,480
continue to exist within finos whether

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,640
it's a project or

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,880
an ongoing working groups but i think

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,919
the goal is

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,720
we we this is potentially very huge

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,120
a very big area of collaboration we

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,000
think

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:47,520
having every firm is going through uh

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the the devops journey and encountering

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
similar

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,760
challenges that are specific to

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,159
regulated industries so

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,200
you know we'd love to hear your feedback

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,919
whether you are

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,360
a software vendor whether you are a

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,679
financial institution

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,679
primarily on what the challenges are so

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,000
please

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,679
don't hesitate to put your comments on

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,679
that issue reaching out to james

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,600
next on it's

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,840
one project that we think has a huge

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,799
potential especially as we

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,080
have joined the linux foundation and of

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,960
course we have a much closer

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,240
relationship

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,080
with you know sister foundations like

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,720
cncf the cloud native computing

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,720
foundation

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,880
this is the cloud service certification

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,320
project which is an incubating

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,320
project focus for this quarter and

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,000
i'm pretty excited to see that the

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,799
project has made a lot of progress this

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,919
quarter

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,120
so i want to ask jason nelson

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,640
from jpmorgan and peter thomas from

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,960
deutsche bank to give us an update

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,960
folks

00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,440
thank you very much um i'll go quickly

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,720
uh

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,120
basically this started off as a project

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,159
because of a common problem between many

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,320
types of banks and other companies where

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,679
we all want to move to cloud we all need

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,880
to

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,360
make a move in a you know compliant and

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,559
uh

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,799
you know meeting our regulatory

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,480
obligations and

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,640
uh this approach for what we're trying

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,039
to do is

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,399
just allowing us to work together uh

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,360
because this is kind of a

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,279
non-competitive issue as far as moving

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,640
to cloud and using cloud

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,679
and working together we can actually

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,159
share the work a little bit and also

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,279
push back to the cloud service providers

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,880
to actually

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,480
do a little bit of this work for us we

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,000
shouldn't have to work so hard just to

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,279
pay for their services and still have to

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,520
configure them this much so

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,440
the progress in this project has evolved

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,960
where we have multiple participants

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,799
from different banks and uh different

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,480
types of banks around the world

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,960
and we're starting to get um our first

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,000
several pull requests which is great and

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,520
this is about where all i'm going to

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,600
hand off to uh peter

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,919
and he's going to kind of talk about

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,559
where we're going

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,600
yeah hi it's um peter thomas here from

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,880
deutsche bank yeah we

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,039
we uh deutsche bank have been

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,679
participating in this for

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,240
a few months we've been going through

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,760
our

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,679
internal processes um to to

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,120
um allow ourselves to contribute but we

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,919
we've we've cleared

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,279
those hurdles now and so we're just

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,960
starting to be able to contribute

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,039
what's interesting coming into this as a

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,640
as the sort of second contributor is you

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,440
can sort of see the overlap

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
but also the differences between um the

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,840
original work that

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,440
jason's done and the um

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,039
and the structure and things that we

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,799
have that are our

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,120
uh content so we've been working quite

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,360
closely together to to reformat

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,880
and agree the template structures are

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,840
the things that we're doing

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
but yeah my my we have a we have a view

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
our

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,120
focus more on azure um uh jason's uh

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,559
primarily focused

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,159
on uh on aws so we see that these two

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,279
things are sort of complementary

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,159
in building up the uh the uh

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,480
assets sort of side by side but we we're

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,240
coming across and sort of our reason for

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,279
wanting to get involved in this is that

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,480
the there are the set of useful things

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,799
that that uh that

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,880
that other concerns uh identity and

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,399
access network security

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,799
data localization gdpr these sorts of

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
things

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,679
they're just they're standard things

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,640
that everybody just seems to have to

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,159
sort out and

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
the solution to them is generally the

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,799
same um within within a cloud platform

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,880
so the ability to pull

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,080
uh to pull the thinking to pull that

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
knowledge and to

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,279
sort of share from each other is is

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,279
really valuable

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,200
so yeah so we've been actively engaged

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,799
in here for a month or two

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,760
um and and i think um you know our focus

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,880
now is on

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,679
starting to build out the azure uh

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,240
the azure content on here alongside the

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,440
uh

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,519
the aws one um on on the screen you can

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,960
see that there's a couple of our

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:16,240
our current issues so around

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,320
event bridging aws um how what sort of

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,039
common services in azure that we would

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,360
want to document um and then some

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
specific services like uh blob storage

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,880
and postgres within azure that are

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,880
initial focus

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,360
if there's anybody else on the call

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,640
today who's interested in participating

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,279
um please let james know

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,039
and we can we can coordinate it that way

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,039
um but that would be great

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,840
uh i think that's it jason anything else

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,840
you wanted to add

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,919
uh no that that was great i mean yes

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,640
please check out the

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,120
uh github and see the type of issues

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,200
that we're

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,559
requesting help on and if there's

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
anything else there's a third leg as

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,840
well for

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,679
uh google so if anybody wants to join in

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,559
on any of those three platforms uh we

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,559
definitely appreciate the help

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,480
jason and thank you peter uh again this

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,679
is

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:16,080
this is amazing to see i think

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:20,240
just just opening up uh to the community

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,960
this is a project but i think that is uh

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,640
room for really any

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,559
whether you work for a financial

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,480
institution whether you work for a

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,799
cloud provider whether you work for a

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,200
system integrator who

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,840
probably get to solve these problems

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
over and over again other different

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,720
customers

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,559
this project has a huge potential for

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,240
everyone so

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,399
and we think more broadly for the

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,039
industry so if you

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,720
have you know if you happen to have

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,480
expertise in these areas

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,840
if you are working on this type of

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,159
projects please

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,919
check out the the github repository the

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,320
the issues that are open

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,679
as well as the mailing list you can

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,880
reach out to the to the

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,240
whole group here so great to see two

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,679
banks collaborating

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,919
and hopefully we'll see more over the

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,000
next months

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:19,119
thank you again peter and jason

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,919
next on uh david

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,040
watkins for waltz very excited this is a

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,919
new contribution

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,839
to the foundation uh uh for the last

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,320
couple of months a very mature project

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,280
so david you want to take it away

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,119
oh yeah thanks uh yeah so uh as

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,560
mentioned waltz has recently been uh

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,200
sort of contributed to the finos

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,520
foundation

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,960
and has become a focused project so

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,399
we're trying to move from

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,800
um incubating to activation so as part

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,839
of that

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,079
i've been working quite extensively with

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,599
james uh

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
and going through the activation

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,679
criteria which is the issues of uh

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,000
tracked on github

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,200
for all to see a large part of that is

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,680
actually just mapping

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,440
some of the existing practices and

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,280
approaches that we're using within waltz

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,440
as well as a fairly mature

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,200
open source project and making sure

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,800
those align correctly

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,520
with the finnos practices and approaches

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
um we're continuing with our steady

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,920
stream of releases

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:23,520
um a couple of days ago

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,800
um 1.25 i think that happened

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,960
yesterday on the day before actually on

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,839
holiday at the moment so my team

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,440
in deutsche bank sorted that one out

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,359
we've been recently doing a bit more in

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,160
terms of reaching out to the community

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,760
so we did a brown bag session with a

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,280
giant brown bag session with finos and

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,400
some members of our team

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,800
uh talking to nat west about how uh how

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
better they can use uh tools like waltz

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,560
they're already a user

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,079
but we've shared some of our sort of uh

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,760
approaches to how we're using it within

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,599
deutsche bank

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,960
um james has been setting up as well a

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,960
bit of a cross-bank

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,640
communications to help us to facilitate

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,400
that sort of joint development uh as uh

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,680
banks like matt west get increasingly

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,680
involved we're seeing quite a few pull

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,800
requests coming from them

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,079
um the documentation we got

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
mentioned there i mean that's just

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,480
basically housekeeping

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,680
uh looking to the future um again

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,760
working with matt west

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,119
uh they're keen on getting a docker

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,400
image uh

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,320
up and running and that's something that

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,200
we're very we've been looking at quite a

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,960
lot in the last few weeks and months

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,240
is looking at how we can really smooth

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,960
the onboarding

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,480
experience waltz is actually quite a

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,079
fairly big beast

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,079
has quite a lot of dependencies quite a

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,160
lot of things that you need to

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,760
have installed so we're really looking

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,000
at some of those requirements

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
and making sure it's as easy as possible

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,640
a for adoption and trying out the

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,880
project

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,320
and b for new developers who would want

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,599
to perhaps contribute

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,960
code and features to the project uh

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,960
further to that uh is uh busy

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,119
continuing with the sort of community

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,680
outreach so we're looking to set up some

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,280
virtual meetups and doing some podcasts

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,599
perhaps with the wider team within

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,560
deutsche bank uh to show that it's not

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,800
just

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,119
uh myself but in the project you know

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,359
there is a team backing this thing up

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,359
um yeah that's pretty much it

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,880
thank you david and um two things i want

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,200
to call out here one is

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,079
this is a very mature you called it the

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,240
big beast

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,480
i would let a a very mature project

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,359
um so we're really proud that she made

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,680
the decision to to bring it under finos

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,280
and i think there's wide applicability

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,240
as you said there are already other

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,240
firms

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,280
using it which again just for the

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,480
community we

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,400
as venus team really look at that as a

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,680
sign of

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,680
really delivering value and

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,760
mutualization when you know the

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,119
the final goal for us is when a piece of

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
code is actually

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,920
shared across multiple institutions in

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
production so

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,200
please check out waltz uh i'm really

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
pleased to hear

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,960
as you know with my with my open source

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,160
developer halathan that you're looking

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,880
to make the

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,720
you know out of the box experience for

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
for developers contributing to the

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,480
project and using the project

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,520
easier i think that's going to go a long

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,200
way

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,200
and i look forward to see this project

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:27,119
active

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,960
thank you and last but not least

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,480
probably doesn't need introduction i

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,760
think all of you

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,520
should be familiar with our dc3 project

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,720
is an active project has been continuing

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,920
uh producing valuable releases

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,040
um so i would like to ask nick colba

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,000
one of our more sort of longest standing

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,480
contributors

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,760
and and one of our board directors as

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,560
well as the

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,400
uh lead for the fdc3 projects to give us

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,880
an update

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,240
hey thanks god can you hear me okay of

terrific hey um so

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,680
hello everyone uh i'm just gonna talk a

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,040
little bit about

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,160
what's been happening in fdc3 land

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,680
uh this quarter as god mentioned we

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,680
are been a project in finnos

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,480
since finnos began um so we're fairly

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,480
mature

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,960
and uh we've um

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,560
had actually a lot going on this quarter

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,839
uh being a focus

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,359
group which has been uh terrific uh

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,119
at the beginning of the quarter we

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,160
released ftc three

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,280
one one uh so a lot of the

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,119
um focused projects

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,400
kind of activity has been around

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,599
promoting

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,560
one one and and we're

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,119
really the goals for that is to really

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,800
drive

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,760
momentum around adoption uh as well as

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,079
driving

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,200
momentum around contrib contribution as

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,480
we uh

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,560
work towards uh beginning the one

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,839
two process um

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,880
so with one one we saw

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,480
over ten con ten firms contributing

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,280
to that standard i wanna just

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,000
give a special shout-outs to openfin

west who really made large

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,599
contributions into that effort

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,800
both uh in terms of contributing uh

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,760
uh to the actual standards themselves as

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,000
well as just

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,800
support with logistics documentation and

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,839
just getting

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,240
things out the door

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,200
we also saw the contribution of the

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,119
first open source

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,240
ftc iii implementation from the

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,040
community

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,359
uh into finos this quarter that was the

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,400
ftc3 chrome extension

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,400
um and you can find that on the

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,520
finnos github it would be great to uh

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,880
get some

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,000
uh more eyeballs and activity around

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,359
that

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,480
um so and then

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,400
finally as we wound down the 1-1 release

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,920
at the beginning of this quarter and

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,480
we've started the one-two

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,920
uh standards process um so a big goal

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,160
and a lot of activity around the group

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,319
has been to streamline the organization

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,480
to make it more accessible and even

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,200
easier for our community to get involved

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,440
and to contribute some of the things

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,640
that we've done working with the finnos

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,680
team this past quarter have been

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,480
to uh move fdc3 onto

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,480
a project structure so with the

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,920
deprecation of programs we

00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,319
we kind of re-jig some of fdc3's

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,560
governance to

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,119
be much simpler and project based um

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,000
we also moved all of the ftc3 materials

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,000
to github

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
which again just gets everything in in

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,880
one place and keeps things a lot simpler

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,760
makes it easier for us to track

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,720
um and we also combined all of our

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,920
working groups

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,880
into a single standards focus group

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,000
and this is great because it means fewer

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,839
meetings

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,760
fewer mailing lists fewer distractions

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,079
and just a greater level of

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,440
accessibility for people coming in

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,200
to fdc3 so

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,040
throughout the rest of the year we're

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,160
going to be focused on

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,800
getting the one two standards set

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,359
as well as continuing to improve and

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,240
support the tooling

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,200
that we make available for fdc3 and for

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,200
the whole community

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,640
and there's going to be exciting things

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,040
like

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,920
more work around the chrome extension as

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,920
well as

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,000
demo apps and

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,680
greater levels of documentation and

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,359
example code that we want to put out

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,800
there

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:18,319
so and just to wrap up

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,319
i want to um uh just

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,520
give a little call out to the community

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,839
to say that

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,319
uh so first of all it's been an

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,119
incredible journey so far and we know

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,200
that there's

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,440
an enormous number of organizations out

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,040
there using ftc3

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,599
and even more that are looking at it so

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,280
uh one of the things that we really want

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,720
to ask everybody to do

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,560
is if you're using ftc3 please let us

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,920
know

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,359
if you can get listed as a

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,240
implementer of ftc3 on our website

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,160
even better on top of that if you're

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,040
feeling very enthusiastic

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,359
would be to work with finnos to produce

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,240
a case study so that we can really get

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,440
the business value of ftc 3 out there

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,400
and documented

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,240
which will just encourage more

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,520
organizations to adopt the standard

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,560
which of course will just

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:19,040
make this standard stronger and

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,359
more valuable and then finally

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,680
we're really again we can never get

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,000
enough contribution so if you

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,480
have some bandwidth contribute and this

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,160
can be as simple as operational support

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,240
things like code examples things like

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,599
documentation it doesn't mean that you

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,040
have to

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,000
contribute a new standard to the group

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,960
so with that i want to uh thank everyone

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,640
and

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:47,440
uh give it back to gab thank you nick

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,800
we are we're really proud of hosting

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,319
fbc3 and the progress

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,440
that you as a team have made and

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,960
you know will continue helping um

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,440
i think it's really important the call

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,119
out you did to

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,720
implementers to let themselves known

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,599
um i i completely agree that that really

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,240
helps

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,839
um you know raising raising the profile

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,440
of the standard and raising

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,440
the amount of adoption so thank you

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,760
and with that we're done with the focus

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,720
projects but we have a couple of more

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,040
updates

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,160
on our community

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,560
things that you might want to be on the

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
lookout for actually nick sort of hinted

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,280
to

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,800
to the continuous work that we do to

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,160
simplify

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,880
our tooling and

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,359
our governance so james you want to give

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,119
a quick

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,680
update on the first three sections here

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,800
yeah absolutely so this is actually

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,079
tiffany's hat to

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,000
um the to odp um

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,839
where both mao and the team have been

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
working hard to really improve the

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,960
efficiency of our

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,520
um project teams so the first three

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,640
things

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,319
are um areas where there have been

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,400
enhancements to the way that we work in

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:10,160
the way that we actually keep everything

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,800
um either more efficient or more united

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,640
and the first is the quality and

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,000
compliance improvements that we're

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,400
actually going to start rolling out

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,640
across

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,800
all teams um and what this is um

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,400
within uh each project team there are

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,720
certain ways that we would like

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,000
um project teams to be setting up their

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,960
repos and you know

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,560
kind of adding um badges to you know

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,359
readme's etc

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,640
that normally you can only maintain by

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,200
doing a review which is a manual step

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,000
but as part of odp and our ongoing

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,760
initiative to

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,040
you know keep everything automated and

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,119
fast um

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,079
we've automated a quality and compliance

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,440
report

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,839
um that actually um will post a github

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,200
issue

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,760
into project um github

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,599
issues um so you can then prioritize it

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,440
on your backlog and the project team can

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,440
then go through and resolve

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,119
all of the inconsistencies of on their

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,040
own and so keep an eye out for

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,280
any issues that get raised on project

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,760
team backlogs

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,640
um in order to get engineers coding

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,760
quickly

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,520
for every um person who's been given

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,880
um or has signed uh finos um cla

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,960
whether that's a ccla or an icla um

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,240
we're actually automating the next step

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,440
of inviting

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,720
those participants into finos um into

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,760
the fitness github

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,559
organization so rather than sign the

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,319
ccla

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,400
and then wait to be invited into the

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:42,000
github organization

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,559
we've got a automated process that will

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,839
actually

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:49,760
fire off that notification to you and so

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:52,240
um if you are signing a ccla

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,920
you should receive a notification into

00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,760
your email from github

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,839
that actually invites you into a github

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,319
team within the

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,680
github um within the finnos organization

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,920
on github

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,920
um and then finally in order to

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,920
remove all of the context switching that

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,200
we have between github

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,720
our project and confluence we now have

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,520
the ability to

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,280
manage all of our meetings agendas

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,359
minutes and actions

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,640
from within github issues rather than

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,920
from within

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,760
the finos wiki which is confluence um

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,599
and what this actually includes is a way

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,880
for us to

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,720
register people within meetings using

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,559
people's github profiles and if you've

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,520
been on cloud service certification or

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,319
odp

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,680
um or fdc3 you would have noticed that

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,280
people are actually saying hello in

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,319
comments and this is so

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,079
um number one we we can actually educate

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,640
people how to get involved in open

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,640
source

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,480
you know through this type of action and

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,000
then we can actually start recording the

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,720
people who are on the call using

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,040
automation

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,079
rather than having to you know scan

00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,200
pages

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:04,160
um and so if anybody wants to

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,520
um have this enabled on their projects

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,079
just um email help

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,760
finance.org where myself and mao will be

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,599
able to enable it for you and actually

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,079
show you the project team how to

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,680
utilize it and make use of it and so

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,280
they're the three things that um we've

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,839
been working on in odp that we would

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,480
like to

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,599
roll out to the rest of the teams that's

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,839
ecab

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,680
thank you james um i wanna plug one more

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,079
thing before i give a quick update on

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,680
the

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:34,319
on the governance um

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,240
in the spirit again of removing friction

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,559
as we know

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,000
even though we think this quarantine has

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,119
accelerated the

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,800
the rate of you know accessibility of

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,680
some of our remote tooling

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,559
we certainly want to reduce the the

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,920
surface

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:55,520
of complexity here and so in the spirit

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,520
of again the simplification

00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,280
more and more of our collaboration out

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,720
of the wiki into github

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,480
for those of you who are familiar with

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,079
the phenols pmc

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,079
repo we have just rebranded it into our

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,280
community repository

00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:16,319
in it we're gonna see up here uh

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,960
a lot of our governance uh uh that's

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,119
where we manage rfc for you folks

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,119
uh uh again this is gonna become the

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,000
place where more and more we ask for

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,000
your input

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,200
and we manage anything that is not

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,280
project specific

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,319
there is foundation related that is

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:36,640
community related is governance related

00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:40,640
on this note just a quick plug

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,880
we'd love your input on how we name

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,079
the open sourcing financial regulation

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,119
initiative we are

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,839
really going back and forth on our names

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,720
um i have plugged this issue in the

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,440
first

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,240
slide of the deck we'd love to get your

00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,960
input

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,000
on how we name one of our strategic

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,000
initiatives

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,079
more and more please keep an eye on this

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,200
repo you might want to start it

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,920
or watch it to get updates because we

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,119
really want your input moving forward so

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,800
i wanted to just plug

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:16,079
one and then spend maybe

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,040
one minute or two on the governance

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,040
and see if you folks have questions so i

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,720
do have one more announcement actually

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,119
gabby was the very last bullet

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,400
on that deck about plexus and it's more

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,760
of an announcement

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,960
um so just to let people know

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,880
the um the plexus interop um project has

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,880
actually moved into the finos github

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,040
organization now just in the same way as

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,480
fdc3 did

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,520
so for anybody who knows um the plexus

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,160
interop

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,440
repository within the plexus interop

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,760
organization

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,040
you will now find that within the github

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,680
organization

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:57,160
the phenols github organization and the

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:59,680
microsite url has also changed to

00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,680
plexus.finos.org

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,160
thank you gab sorry about that no

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,680
worries thank you james um

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,800
so just quickly as an update um

00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,040
you all know or should know i hope that

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,440
we earlier in the year in order to

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,280
simplify our governance we have

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,480
worked with the board to deprecate the

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,040
the

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,119
concept of programs as a governance

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,599
structure in our community

00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,160
um that was approved by the board in

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,720
april

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,520
and then i personally worked with all

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,559
the programs

00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,359
throughout may you know this was a

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,160
deprecation

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,079
so they didn't have to disband they

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,240
could have continued operating but all

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,640
of the programs decided to continue as

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,839
individual projects in recognition that

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,240
again a simplification of our governance

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:50,000
was

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,720
due and would help new contributors come

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,160
on board

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,800
more easily so in april with the board

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,920
approval

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,760
the finance team had also the uh

00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,520
was authorized by the board to make the

00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,720
necessary changes to the governance

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,359
we're trying to keep

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,440
changes to the minimum but to provide a

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,359
very concise

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,839
and really flexible version of our

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:16,079
governance the u.s project teams can

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:17,760
evolve independently of course

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,280
always according to the open source and

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,880
transparency principles

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:26,000
that govern our community so

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,960
just to give you a visual

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,400
for those of you who prefer that this

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,920
was our governance

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,480
you know program based until last year

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,359
as we remove programs of course there is

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,119
a pretty big

00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,960
void that we needed to fill and so

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,000
that's what we're doing

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,200
right now we are in the stage where the

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,319
inos team uh approves and nurtures

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,040
projects

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,760
uh um as well as then report up to the

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,839
board

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,880
we will use the focus project framework

00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,839
that we

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,359
use today to really focus the feedback

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,240
that we bring up to the board but the

00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,960
expectation is that

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,160
every project will continue reporting to

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,640
the board on a quarterly basis

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,400
i've mentioned the idea of introducing a

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,760
technical advisory council and this is

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,800
something that we're gonna explore with

00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,240
the governing board

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,800
as we form it uh next month um

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,800
i've had thanks to all of you raise your

00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,880
hand to participate in the attack

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,240
i think for me the next step that is

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,319
really understanding whether there is

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,119
commitment from financial institutions

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,440
who would

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,720
again really lead from a requirements

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,480
standpoint

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,480
um so for now we are in this stage

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,079
and we'll be exploring the creation of

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,880
attack so

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,680
more specifically what you can expect is

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,280
something

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,280
right now our governance is really

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,160
spread out through

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,319
policies in the website uh a whole lot

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,240
of pages on the wiki

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,799
we are actually dumping that down to

00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,119
really

00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,680
a single project governance template

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,640
which should fit a contributing.md file

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,000
and we live

00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,599
in every project again

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,359
you shouldn't expect many changes from

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,200
however in the community right now it's

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,480
really just simplifying it and putting

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,160
in a single place

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,040
and the goal will be for every project

00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:21,599
to be able to change that

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:23,119
if they want by majority votes

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,520
in the new community repo we are

00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,880
consolidating we're really moving our

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,799
governance and the hub

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,319
and the entry point for our governance

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:33,680
in our community repo

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:38,559
so expect some updates there

00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:40,559
and as i mentioned before of course um

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,559
let's not conflate governance structures

00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,559
with community building structure and

00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,319
taxonomies so we're actually building a

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,079
new taxonomy what we call a project

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,240
landscape

00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,000
if you're familiar with the cloud native

00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,760
computing foundation landscape we're

00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,480
using the same framework

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,559
and we will of course ask you this will

00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,920
be all done in github we will of course

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,200
ask you to help us

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,559
not only adding projects uh to the to

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,720
the landscape but really how we

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,400
categorize and present and message

00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,839
this will be the central point that we

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,760
can all use

00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,280
to message around the projects in

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,920
finland

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,720
uh we have a few additional open items

00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,920
um

00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,760
which we'll be discussing with the

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,559
membership and governance committee over

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,960
the next month

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,960
i'm not going to go in the details there

00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,359
but just one thing you can expect this

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,119
month

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:31,280
is as as james hinted to

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,000
a project reporting process we want to

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,400
make sure that it's largely automated

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,760
and you guys don't have to spend much

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,880
time on it

00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,680
but we want the first governing board to

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,799
really have

00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:48,480
all reports for all projects out there

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,880
and with that i have actually

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,920
completed the presentation and but we

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,359
have eaten

00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,119
the time for questions i might have time

00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:01,200
for one i don't know if there are

00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:04,160
questions in the chat

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,680
don't see the chat right now i'll is

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:13,839
there any question

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:13,839
that came up in chat

00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,079
okay

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,720
nothing that is actually specific to

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:29,359
very to the group now

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,319
yeah anyone has any final questions

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,319
before we wrap them

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,480
so the only thing that i'd like to add

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,160
is if um anybody on the call is

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,680
interested in joining any of the

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,839
projects that you've seen today

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,280
then please feel free to email me at
