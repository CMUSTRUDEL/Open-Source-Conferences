Description: 
	JAMES MCLEOD // DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY // FINOS
The Open Developer Platform is an OSS delivery pipeline offered to all FINOS members and is composed of DevOps tools and mechanisms that keep engineers safe whilst contributing to Fintech Open Source. During his talk, James focuses on Docusaurus, a ReactJS platform used by FINOS and the ODP project for building collaborative wikis, and explains how contributing to documentation in repos helps grow healthy and safe open source communities.

The London Open Source Fintech Meetup is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).

right so um welcome everyone i'm james

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,290
mccloud i'm the director of community of

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,990
the FinTech open source foundation thank

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,029
you for that great introduction Colin I

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,730
really appreciate it and like Colin was

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,710
saying Scott logic Karachi really valued

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,029
member of um finish and it's really

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,720
great to be able to collaborate with a

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:28,009
fellow member on an event like this so

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,380
what I'd like to actually talk about is

00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:33,680
what we're doing within finis not only

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,370
to progress banking and FinTech but also

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,260
to educate and show people how to

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,080
collaborate as an open source community

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,080
as well so for the people who actually

00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,510
came to react meetup a couple of days

00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,460
ago this will seem quite familiar for

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,920
other people who have never collaborated

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,340
with in github before this might be

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,350
something new for you to try out

00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,239
so within finis we actually have a

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,880
project called the open developer

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,440
platform and if you're an engineer

00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,049
you'll know that continuous integration

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,340
and continuous development is kind of

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,060
part of DevOps

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,950
philosophy for getting things done fast

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,900
but within open source and specifically

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,760
within a regulated environment of open

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,790
source you need to make sure that you're

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,220
able to do that safely and so for us the

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,500
open developer platform is a way that we

00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,170
can take code from github and get it

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,450
into the cloud whilst also automating

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,070
security checks license checks and

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,049
anything else that could be a

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,549
vulnerability that you would need to

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:39,710
know about as a financial organization

00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,020
so what we're actually doing as part of

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,600
finis is kind of really accelerating the

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,010
pace of engineering like a lot of the

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,200
the bigger banks are actually doing

00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,510
within their digital transformations

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,330
right now and all of that is represented

00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,950
within circles hence you know this is

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,689
actually showing you the delivery of

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,430
code to your customers and getting you

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:05,210
know nice tight short feedback loops so

00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:07,549
in order to help engineers move fast

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,739
and in order to also help people

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,930
understand how you can collaborate in

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,359
open-source what we're working on right

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,430
now is a way their engineers and other

00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:17,959
people because I'm like on

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,719
st. open-source isn't just for

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,209
developers is for people outside of

00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,280
development as well but in order to

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,519
educate how you can actually make

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,670
commits into github which is almost like

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,889
a social platform for engineering we're

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,530
taking all of our documentation away

00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:38,180
from Ana Atlassian product called

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,030
confluence and we're actually bringing

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,799
it into github itself which is actually

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,829
really cool so all of our documentation

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:48,290
sits right next to our code and anyone

00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:51,290
can collaborate around it so what we're

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:55,159
seeing here is the thinnest organization

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,109
on github in the top left the way that

00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,739
we're actually working in github as

00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:03,169
feature teams using Kanban and then also

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,480
I believe that's the open developer

00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:07,879
platform repository which is where all

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,680
of our materials if you're an engineer

00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,810
or even if you're a product owner or or

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,739
if you are a business analyst will

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,620
actually end up now within that style

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,840
what you can actually be just like if

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,639
you're using WordPress as a CMS or

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,699
HubSpot or something that takes your

00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,530
content that gets delivered to your

00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:32,540
website you can actually deliver all of

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,419
that content into a repository which

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,299
means that everybody on the team can

00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:40,099
edit your website okay which might seem

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,930
a bit odd because normally it's

00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,400
marketing he does that or it's somebody

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,470
else in a different role somewhere else

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,590
who does that but within the context of

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,199
open source anyone can edit

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,519
documentation and then a member of the

00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,620
team will actually read it and make sure

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,620
that it's um you know something that you

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,470
want to accept and in order to do that

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,389
we actually use a tool it's actually a

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,040
react app funny enough and this is the

00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:07,459
reason why I spoke about it two days ago

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,379
called Dhaka Soros which is actually a

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,599
front-end application written in react

00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,120
and the great thing about it is that you

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,669
don't necessarily need to be a coder in

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,630
order to write documentation that this

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,630
renders and I'm going to show you how

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,630
hopefully

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,240
so while I'm actually showing you right

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,660
now is a real life repository for a

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,580
project of ours called FDC 3 so I know a

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,810
few people would have heard of FDC 3 so

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,110
this have a show of hands who's heard of

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,890
FDC 3 right great FDC 3 right so the

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,040
great thing about FDC 3 is that they

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:51,160
actually have all of their documentation

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,840
as markdown files which is almost like a

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,330
word doc you know it's a way that you

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,760
can actually edit your content of your

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,920
website but it's in the repository so

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,860
it's it's actually sitting with within

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,680
the FDC 3 API repository and as you can

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,660
see it looks like a rendered Word

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,690
document but the great thing about it is

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,480
that you can actually edit it as part of

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:17,620
the code itself as part of the project

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,150
and so what I'm going to do which is

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,180
quite risky here because I've not

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,990
actually tested the local Wi-Fi which I

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,660
should have is actually clone this so

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:35,530
just to prove so there's nothing in the

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:37,330
folder I'm going to get clone the FDC 3

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,620
repository so we'll see that coming down

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,350
so what I'm actually doing is bringing

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,670
the FDC 3 API repository to my local

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,620
machine and that's what we call our

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,350
computers so if I could say local

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,240
machine I mean my computer and then if I

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,550
then take a look inside you'll see that

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,610
there's a folder around here called FDC

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,990
3 right so that is big enough so if I

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,970
then go into FDC 3 you'll see it looks a

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,120
little bit of techie but basically this

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,970
structure here is exactly the same as

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,490
the structure that's listed in github so

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,940
it's all down on my computer now and so

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:17,320
if I then open a code editor called

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:20,080
Visual Studio code you'll notice that

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,930
this here has just come down onto my

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,320
local computer and that reflects exactly

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,060
what is showing in github right now

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,980
which is where we store everything so

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,500
shout out if this is too small so I can

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,880
actually zoom all of this in right so

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,370
what I want to do is get a little bit

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,630
more into the weeds of Technology not

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:43,330
too far bare little bit

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:45,160
and I want to within the project go into

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,590
the website directory because this

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,070
website directory is where doki Soros

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,260
actually is so this is where it's um

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,270
built and this is where it runs and I

00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,180
want to run a command called yarn and

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,920
what yarn does within open-source is it

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,660
takes loads of different libraries from

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,550
open source so we run things called um

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,530
repositories in open source and all of

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,080
this stuff this happening on the desktop

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,200
now is actually bringing all of those

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,210
open source libraries down and it's

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,540
actually built it so I've actually got a

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:26,410
compiled version of doc you source local

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:29,920
and then if I hit or type yarn start so

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:34,720
more magic happens right so we get a

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,860
live reload and on my local host which

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,440
is my local computer

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,960
I now have the FDC 3 microsite running

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,140
which is great and that's good but the

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,870
the real gem of this is within this

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:52,930
structure of the website I can now go

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:57,790
into the pages so if I go into the index

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,350
for instance which within like web

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,570
development the index is kind of like

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:05,250
your landing page so it's basically this

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:10,150
one if I look up API which is this

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:15,670
heading here and I do a search for it

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:17,200
you can see it here so if I then just

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,690
write james test i should have written

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,060
hello world then you'll notice that this

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,490
is changed and so the real kind of power

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,580
of this is that it puts the micro site

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:31,030
into the hands of your developers so for

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,719
any documentation that represents FDC 3

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:38,590
which is actually in the docs here so

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:43,960
the introduction which is called up here

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:48,460
FDC 3 entry i can then find this within

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,920
my version docs you'll notice is called

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,639
FDC 3 entry

00:08:50,920 --> 00:09:01,300
and then using a little bit of markdown

00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:05,620
I can say James have a world

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:08,829
like say come back and then it's

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,540
rendered right in your micro site now at

00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:11,050
the moment this is actually on my local

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,570
machine

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,850
I'm not going to fast forward to getting

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,160
this onto github but basically the next

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:23,040
step will be committing this into your

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,510
repository so if I do a git status

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,730
you'll notice that I've made a kekkai

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:31,570
change I can then commit that locally I

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,820
can then push it to the repository on

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,279
github raise a pull request and then

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,470
instantly your micro site which is live

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,510
is actually there ready for people

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,029
outside of your project team to read and

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,730
so that's a way that we are actually

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,399
educating people who aren't used to this

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:52,230
life cycle how to become open-source

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,230
contributors thank you

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,460
