[Music]

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,640
everyone thank you for joining today um

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
this week's edition of the finnos open

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
source readiness working group

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
uh today we have with us kathleen liu

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
kathleen

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,800
is an ip attorney who uh

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,560
who works on open data issues among many

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,680
other things at mapbox

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
mapbox is a company that provides a

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,800
platform and apis for

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,480
web and mobile developers to access

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
mapping data

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,120
turn-by-turn directions etc etc they

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
make a really cool product

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
and among other things the mapping space

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,960
is one area where open data

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,920
is uh particularly uh

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
relevant and widely used um basically

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
due to

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
the um now i'm going to forget the name

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,239
of the project kathleen you want to step

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
in here

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,880
openstreetmap yes openstreetmaps project

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
which is licensed under the open

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
database license

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,840
as i understand it so i asked kathleen

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
to come in

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,119
and talk to us today because i think

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,479
that open data is going to be something

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
that's increasingly interesting and

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,759
relevant to those of us in the financial

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
services space

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
so i asked her to share her experience

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
with open data licensing

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
and how it's different from open source

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
licensing and and what to do and what

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,400
not to do

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,479
when you're getting into open data uh so

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
kathleen uh feel free to add to my

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,159
introduction

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
and take it away um thanks sarah i know

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,960
that was that was great

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,159
um so uh i

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,360
will just do like a overview

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,759
of um the open data licensing landscape

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,840
um and uh if you have questions you know

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,759
feel free

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,159
to uh type them into chat and then

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,119
aaron will like stop me at the end of a

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
slide

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
um and ask me the questions uh so feel

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,520
free to put your questions

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
in during the presentation they don't

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,840
have to all

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
wait for the end

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,560
okay so um just so you know where we're

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
headed these are

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,120
the topics that i am going to cover

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
so we're going to talk about um open

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
data as a

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
as a concept uh especially compared to

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,879
open source

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,840
we're going to talk about the laws um

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,720
that are relevant in this space uh we're

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
going to talk about

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
some of the different licenses that are

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,400
available

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,400
and then we're going to talk about to

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,959
practical considerations

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,800
when you're entering this space the

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,080
disclaimer is of course i am a lawyer

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,080
but i am not your lawyer

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,000
um so why why would you want to

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,760
enter the open data space um so this

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,879
is a definition of open from the open

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,319
knowledge foundation

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,519
um you're probably familiar with it um

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,560
you know from open source space right

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,400
conceptually uh open

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,959
data is very similar to open source

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
you know the the idea that open means

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
anyone can freely access

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,800
use modify and share for any purpose uh

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,560
subject at most

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
requirements that preserve provenance

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,200
and openness

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,440
so open data have an open source have

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,879
very

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,239
similar uh what i was called frameworks

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,440
and goals

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,560
um as we saw in the previous slide the

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,920
goal of openness is basically

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,000
you know we want this out there we want

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,200
it to be used we want it to be

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,959
freely shared um

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,159
and you know with within

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,799
limitations so the

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,159
the general framework of open data

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,360
licenses

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,159
is similar to the general framework of

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
open source licenses um you see a lot of

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,879
attribution clauses

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,400
um you see attempts to

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,840
have essentially a share-like format

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,960
um similar to what you might see in gpl

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,120
or a gpl um

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
i assume you are all very very familiar

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
with the open source landscape so i'm

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,759
not going to go

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,840
into detail on those things but

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
please you know stop me and ask me to

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,680
explain further

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,680
if i'm going in too deep

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,639
what's different about open data is

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
a lot of it comes from the legal

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,759
landscape that surrounds

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,759
data versus code

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,800
and i'm going to talk about this more in

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,600
detail

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,479
but the laws that govern open data are

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
simply different

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,479
than the laws that govern open source

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,520
and that tends to affect

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,720
um what you can do on the licensing

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,039
front

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,919
even if it doesn't affect the intent um

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,880
another thing about uh open data that

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,080
tends to be different

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
is where the data the open data tends to

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
come from

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,320
um with open source you

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,680
you know you see all kinds right you see

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,560
individuals

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,080
who write some code um and put it up in

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
a github repo

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,240
and you know turns out

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
apparently you know 20 000 companies use

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,560
that tiny little

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,680
snippet um that tiny little npm

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,840
module that one person

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,440
wrote you know five years ago um

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,160
with open data you can have individuals

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,800
put up

00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:00,319
data but it tends to be larger entities

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,520
just because they tend to be

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,120
the people who already have the data

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,000
a lot of government will put out open

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
data

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,039
which is pretty different from open

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
source you don't see a lot of open

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,400
source

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,919
coming from government entities you see

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,800
it more and more now

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,319
than you used to but governments i think

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,479
have been

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
really late comers on the open source

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,199
side

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,160
where as governments have really been

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,199
leaders on the open data side

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,120
a lot of governments have found that

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,800
they can better serve their constituents

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,680
by making large swaths of

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,880
their data available and in the united

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
states in particular

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,280
there's a culture of this where

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,400
you know federal data especially um

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,840
has long been very available to

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,360
everyone and there are

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,800
many states that have foia laws um

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,840
creative information act or similar laws

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,319
that make state data also widely

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
available

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
the the user pool

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,960
differs somewhat um

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:30,000
i i would say that you know there are

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:33,919
definitely people who um

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,160
who uh are hobbyists

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,440
um who are using open data

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,800
um but there are also

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,800
a lot of companies who are using open

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,479
data

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,759
and there are

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,639
a lot of governments who are essentially

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,160
trying to

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:02,000
pull their data so that

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,360
they can you know get more insight

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,440
um there are a lot more researchers i

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,120
think who use open data

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,800
than their uh they than open source

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,000
um i think the academic community is

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,520
very heavily dependent on open data

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,879
um and uh uses it quite a bit

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:30,240
um for research purposes

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,240
far more so than than open source

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,240
so uh this is a question mostly from the

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
perspective of if you

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,880
have data and you

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,080
want to put that data out there somehow

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,560
you want to license it somehow should

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,120
you

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,600
apply an open data license to that data

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,519
and i think you'll recognize that these

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,720
pros and cons are very similar

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:07,200
to the pros and cons

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,000
considered in open source on the pros

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
you have collaboration you have people

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,519
who

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,440
might help clean up your data

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
same you know as if they were fixing

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
bugs in your code

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,760
or add to it

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
it does enable transparency um

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
especially this is again

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,279
especially important to um academics and

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,040
to academic research

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,160
um but of course you know if you open

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,320
if you open license something right

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,360
then literally anybody can use it

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
um and there is a

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,519
loss of control in that respect and very

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
similar to open source

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,279
um once you put something out there you

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,320
know if it's

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,399
in a github repo or on a web page

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,519
there are certain expectations from the

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,959
public at large

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,560
especially if your source gets popular

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,040
um people might expect you to

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,079
fairly or unfairly expect you to keep it

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,440
up to date

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,440
um and uh people

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,399
you know may uh download your data a lot

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
um and you may just you know have server

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,360
issues

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,640
um hosting that much data uh if it gets

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,000
really popular

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,160
um and of course people might

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,440
you you know this is both a pro and a

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,920
con right

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,880
people will use that open data for

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,320
things

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,079
that you never imagined um

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,959
and sometimes that's going to be amazing

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,320
um and sometimes you're going to be

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
dismayed

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,720
and that is of course just the nature of

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
open um

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,440
so uh i'm gonna talk about the legal

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,839
landscape next um do we have any

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
questions so far

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:11,839
no not yet no okay

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,200
um so what's very interesting about data

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,240
i'm going to start with the u.s first

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
is that

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:25,600
data in large part is not copyrightable

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,720
in the united states facts

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,279
are not copyrightable the selection

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,240
of arrangement of facts can be

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,279
copyrightable

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,560
if it's original selection

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,000
but the courts have said that

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,800
basic arrangements like alphabetical um

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,640
in numerical order chronological order

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,200
these are not original

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,680
and so you can imagine that some of the

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,720
most

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,839
useful ways to organize data

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
are not copyrightable and oftentimes the

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,079
data

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,519
itself is not copyrighted so for example

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,040
um if you have a list of all of the

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,320
addresses

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,440
in a town right the the fact that

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,279
those are the addresses for buildings

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
and those buildings are in that town

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,079
that's not copyrightable

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,800
if you put them in organized by

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,839
say street name and then by street

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,279
number

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,279
that's not an original organization

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,760
and of course with modern databases

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,760
since databases can be

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,279
reordered very very easily

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,279
just by choosing to index on a different

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,320
field i it's very very easy to

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:53,279
copy what is essentially the database

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:57,360
without copying the arrangement

00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:01,279
um what's so this this case

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,279
feist versus world telephone service

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,720
um is uh it is

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,160
sort of the source of um this

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,279
concept uh that facts are not

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,320
copyrightable

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
um and in that case involved a telephone

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,360
book

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,639
um so this was a list of names

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,399
phone numbers and addresses for

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,680
the people who lived in this county

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,040
uh the publisher actually included

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,560
some fake um names

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,600
like uh in there and the whole thing was

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,199
copied

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,720
but the supreme court found that

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,720
there was no copyright infringement

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
um and then another thing that's

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,800
suitable is

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,399
if you simply digitize something

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,680
that is not copyrightable

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,600
you know in the public domain or

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,800
something um

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,800
you know putting it into your own format

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:10,880
that's not creative that's not creative

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:17,839
um so that like by itself is not going

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,839
to add originality

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,480
um so the

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,839
this is a little different um

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
internationally

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,040
um where you know um

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,560
as you probably know copyright law is

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,839
jurisdictional so

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,040
it is different in every country

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,320
um there is a older theory

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,399
of uh sweat of the brow which is

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,480
the idea that copyright protection

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
should apply

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,560
when somebody has put forward a great

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,079
deal of effort

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,199
into something um and under that theory

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:01,040
uh which was you know what the court

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,079
considered and discarded in feist

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,800
um yeah because uh somebody

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
puts a great deal of effort into putting

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,720
together

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,040
a database um that database should have

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,839
copyright protection

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,839
a lot of countries have a creativity

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,480
creativity threshold

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,399
that is higher than the one in the us

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
the us only requires a modicum of

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,040
creativity

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,079
um but uh as we

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,959
saw and faced um facts

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
are insufficient

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,160
so um one thing of note

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,040
is that um in europe

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,199
uh europe has adopted suigenous uh

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,959
protection for databases so they have a

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,399
special database

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,160
protection law which uh provides 15

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,360
years of protection

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,360
also a lot shorter than copyright um

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,160
the us has at times you know

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,800
considered uh going the european route

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
and

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,959
and uh congress has not

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,399
not done it um

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,399
but and there are like a few other

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,320
countries that have also considered this

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:22,320
but eu is really the big jurisdiction

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:26,560
um where this is a consideration

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,480
um we're not entirely sure what's going

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,920
to happen with the uk

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,519
uh since brexit

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,519
um it's still unclear i think how they

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,560
are going to sort out all of the ip

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,440
issues

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,639
um everything pre-existing will continue

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,920
to have

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:50,000
the protection for the term um

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,040
but they're going to have to sort out um

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,160
whether they are going to

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,360
adopt those protections uh going forward

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,839
or not um

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,439
so basically what europe has done has

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,880
is they've decided we're going to

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,760
protect that effort

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
um we think it's valuable we don't think

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,000
it's

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,679
the same as copyright we don't think

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,880
it's the same as

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,880
you know a novel or a movie

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
but we think that putting together a

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,839
database

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,280
is something that we want to financially

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,480
incentivize

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,039
and offer a shorter

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,880
duration of protection um and the

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,440
protection the rights that it protects

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,960
is very

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,280
very similar to copyright um

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,039
you know protecting against unauthorized

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:50,480
access and unauthorized duplication

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,160
um so another aerial law

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,400
that's relevant to uh open licensing

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
then to licensing in general is contract

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,559
law

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,679
right contracts are an agreement

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,000
between you and

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,799
whoever you know whoever you enter into

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,160
the contract

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,000
with whoever is a recipient of

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,679
the license so in this respect

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,320
uh it is very very similar uh to open

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,760
source

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,799
where there is the potential

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,080
of a contractual claim if somebody

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,000
violates an open source license

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:35,120
where this is different than open source

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,440
is often under open source

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
if they don't abide the light by the

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,480
license

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,320
then the claim is well

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,760
you don't have a license therefore

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,280
you your use is unauthorized

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:57,440
and infringing and i'll sue you

00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,559
for copyright infringement with

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,480
open data it's quite possible

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,760
that contract law is the only thing

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,720
holding it together where

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,120
you might be able to say you know you

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
you

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,720
agreed to a license when you got this

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,760
data

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,120
you're in breach of that license um and

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,240
then your claim might be

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
for contractual damages but there might

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,760
not be anything

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,760
underlying that

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,600
underlying that where you can't also say

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
well

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,280
you have to agree that you accepted this

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
license

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,080
because otherwise your use would be

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
infringing

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,559
okay so that's the legal landscape

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,840
um any questions there before i go into

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,840
the next section

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,039
i don't see any in the chat

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
it's too low too early in the morning

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,760
okay um so i'm just gonna go over

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,960
um a few

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,679
types of uh open licenses um

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
not trying to be comprehensive and list

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,080
every single one

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
there are not nearly as many open data

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,480
licenses as

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,679
there are open source licenses but there

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,960
are still a lot of them um

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,960
so at the most

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,880
um permissive level you have uh cc0

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
you have the public knowing dedication

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,159
license um

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,280
you these are licenses possibly um you

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
seen in the open source space uh they

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,240
just

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,320
you know the point is to disclaim all

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,400
rights as completely as

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,720
possible um worldwide

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
and of course that means you know the

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,840
data could end up anywhere

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,919
and oftentimes with data um

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:12,799
it's not obvious uh where it came from

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,440
um if there is not like metadata or

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,200
other attribution that's attached and

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,000
that stays attached

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,039
um things like you know a list of

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,360
addresses

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:28,559
uh can end up in in whatever place and

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,559
you probably wouldn't be able to tell

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,840
um the second grouping would be

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,600
attribution licenses

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,880
um so in the open source space right

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,320
this is like your mit your

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,240
bsd your isc

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:52,240
um in the data space uh you see

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,280
a lot of cc by usage

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,320
um you uh also

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,000
see um a lot of governments uh

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,919
use something called the open government

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,919
license um

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,440
there are different variations the uk

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,400
has one canada has one

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,679
um i've seen a number of other countries

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,919
have them

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,720
they tend to have uh

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,840
clauses specific to the country um in

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,520
those

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,559
uh so i wouldn't recommend anybody

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,000
use them for their own data but

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,720
um they are useful to look at when

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,919
you're

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,280
learning about the space to see you know

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,600
commonalities

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:41,600
um and to see what uh what

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,039
other large entities are doing um

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,400
there is the open data commons um

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,360
attribution license uh i mentioned that

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,880
because that's sort of like the

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,440
the attribution only version of the

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
open database license which i'll talk

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,000
about in detail later

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,559
in relation to openstreetmap

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,159
a relatively new license is the

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,039
community data license

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,919
agreement the permissive version there's

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,919
two versions

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,600
permissive and sharing uh this license

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,720
came out uh i want to say a year ago

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,960
um and i think one of the

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,840
probably the major criticism i had about

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
it was

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,559
we really don't need another like data

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,760
license um another open data license

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,240
i think in some ways

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,039
open data learned some lessons from open

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,520
source

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,039
about license proliferation and in some

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,600
ways they didn't

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,000
um because there are not nearly as many

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,640
open data licenses as there are open

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,480
source

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,120
where at the beginning of um

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,480
when people started using open source

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
everybody was writing their

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,799
own license right like the reason it's

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,919
called mit is because

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,039
mit put that out there

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,320
and bsd you know like

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,799
right everybody had their own um

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,760
and that happened hasn't happened nearly

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,720
as much

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,159
with open data uh because the popularity

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,919
of open data

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:23,679
um came about later um and by that time

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:27,679
you did see things um like cc bye

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:30,960
um that were out there in this space

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,760
trying to um imperfectly

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
but trying to cover this area but they

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
did

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,000
put out a couple of new licenses this

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,840
was the linux foundation that did this

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,200
um and i wouldn't you know i don't think

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,320
there's anything particularly

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,960
wrong with uh cdla

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,919
um i think it might be a tad too permiss

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,120
too

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,279
prescriptive on um

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,240
and detailed on like metadata and

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,159
attribution

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,960
um and those formats but

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,240
i really just think that you know too

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,400
many licenses

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:12,159
um in general is not helpful

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,159
uh to the community at large

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:20,000
um some other limitations that you might

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:23,039
see um in the open data space

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,360
generally um some of these

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,480
i think would not fall under the

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,840
definition

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,720
of open um that the open knowledge

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,480
foundation

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,120
uh would use um but it's common to see

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,720
these

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,559
so you see a lot of researchers would

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,520
put out their

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,039
research data sets um for other

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,840
researchers to use

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,520
um but only uh other academic

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,880
researchers

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,559
um you'll see some data sets

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,600
as uh cc by non-commercial

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,039
you'll also see some data sets as cc by

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,559
no derivatives

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,679
that one i think is rather odd to use

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,960
with databases

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,799
given how

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,919
normal it is to um update databases

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,960
uh and to combine data but

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,720
um some people do make that choice

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,919
um uh you see uh

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,240
a lot in um of data out there a lot of

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,360
what

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,080
i call public data from counties and

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,200
cities

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,960
um that's labeled personal use only

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,320
um a lot of counties

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,600
sell data

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,679
to companies for commercial use

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,600
but they also for foia reasons or for

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,120
other reasons

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,159
make it available to people who

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,640
you know to locals um to use

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,440
sort of for their own interests to you

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
know kind of

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,760
see what their government is up to um

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,679
and you'll see a lot of limitations

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,679
you know this is for your personal

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,760
non-commercial use

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,000
um there are some governments where

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,880
um you might you tend to see this a

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,720
little more

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,399
in the developmental space

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,960
where there are some data sets that are

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,000
out there

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,039
for governments and ngos

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,559
um and it's put out uh for certain

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,960
purposes

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,720
um and they make it publicly available

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,159
um essentially as a matter of

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,760
convenience

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:47,039
um but it's

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,240
you know not inten it's not intended for

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:53,840
um for companies um

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,120
or even for your like average everyday

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,240
user

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,080
but just because they don't you know

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,520
they don't put technical controls on it

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,600
they just like

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,679
throw it up on a website but then label

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,679
it for governments and ngos

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:17,760
um so i mentioned

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:21,120
uh the open database uh

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,360
the open database license uh earlier um

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
so opendatabase license is what you

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,880
might call a weak

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,240
sharealike license uh similar to lgpl

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,440
there's also uh creator commons to share

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,640
alike

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,840
um and then the new one which is

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,360
cdla sharing and the

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,200
concept of these licenses

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,640
is very similar to gpl or agpl

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,600
in open source world which is

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,960
if you use this data if you mix it with

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,080
other data

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,799
uh then that other data also

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,919
needs to be contributed back right and

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,360
needs to be

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,080
put out there under uh this

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,120
under sharealike license so that it is

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,799
also open

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,080
and free for everyone to use

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:20,240
um i will note that until

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,279
4.0 the 4.0 version of creative commons

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,039
licenses

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,799
previous commons licenses were not

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,039
designed for data

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:32,640
they were really designed uh for

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,520
work said creative works that everybody

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,279
uh you know thinks of when they think of

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,480
creative commons

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,080
and one of the big issues

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,240
um in putting out the 4.0 licenses

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,000
was whether they were going to try to

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,440
deal with data rights

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,360
on at all and so

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,679
in many ways the creative commons

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,799
suite of licenses tries to

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:08,320
disclaim uh database rights

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:11,360
instead of really embracing them

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,720
um so you know

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,960
similarly to i think

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,159
um the

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,200
similarly to like gpl and such in open

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,480
source

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,240
um you

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,440
don't see um these licenses

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,399
used as much because they really

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:42,399
do really strong limitations

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,559
um on usage um a lot of times

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,240
uh you know these for example like these

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
licenses are not compatible with each

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,039
other

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,960
so you can't take

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:58,240
you know you can't make cc by sa

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,519
data and slap um

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,039
a cdla sharing license on it

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:09,679
um or an odbl license on it so

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:12,880
even if those even if that data is under

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,000
like similarly principled licenses

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,000
you couldn't use it together

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,559
um any questions there

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
before we talk about practical

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,679
considerations

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,399
i have a question um which is

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,159
what does it mean um it you know and i'm

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,760
sure it's different license by license

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,159
but what does it mean to use

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,000
data together in a way that requires

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,080
permission under a license so i know

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,159
you know obviously in open source

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,919
licenses there is a specific right under

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,080
copyright law which is the right to make

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,039
derivative works or collective works and

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,840
so we know

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,559
you know why that limitation exists and

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,120
sort of

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,200
sort of what the shape of it is but um

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,519
you know if we have two databases that

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
are

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,000
differently licensed and you know we

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,760
load them into separate systems but you

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
know there are lookups from both of them

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
by the same application

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,320
as that combining the data etc so that

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,360
is a very good question

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,399
um i will go into detail on that um

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,840
in a few slides on odbl

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,720
on the creative commons right is written

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,760
for you know the standard copyright

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,039
world

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,159
so it just says it's a derivative work

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,200
what a derivative work is in

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,720
when you're looking at databases i

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,000
honestly have no idea it's not something

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,760
that's been well litigated um you know

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,679
you really you really are guessing there

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,200
because especially in the u.s

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,880
right because like the rights that are

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
listing creative commons

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,640
uh licenses they really did start off

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,600
with the list of

00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,480
us 106 rights and so

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,200
you know what people know what a

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,880
different

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,960
mostly know what it will work in the

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,480
concept of when you're talking about a

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,760
book or something like that

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,919
um but with data if

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,039
what's protected is the arrangement of

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,799
selection

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,159
then usually when you're creating a

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,279
degree of work

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,519
the arrangement selection is gone

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,720
right what you if you make a derivative

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,080
of a database

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,399
or by mixing it with something else

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,200
by um adding elements or removing

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,880
elements

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,799
usually the arrangement selection is

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,399
gone so then

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,320
you know what that would that was

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,519
copyrightable um

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,480
still exists i don't know and it's not

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,640
something that's been well tested

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,519
okay great thank you um so

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,480
from from a practical perspective right

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,279
um

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,360
you're you're going to take different

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,200
pieces of data you might be

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,799
kind of like peeing them side by side

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,000
you might just

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,720
be combining them um for faster search

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
you know because

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,079
it's probably faster um you

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,320
might be letting somebody query your

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,440
database right and then

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,839
uh somebody might get a result of like

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,040
10 things out of your database um

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,040
there you there are a lot of

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,119
considerations

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,119
about the limits of

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,679
what clauses on

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:37,440
open data can do that

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,480
have not been

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,240
completely figured out

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,720
um and these are the limitations that i

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,000
think

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,359
cause the most consternation

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,960
so um attribution is one i think the

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,520
open source world has

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,320
actually sorted out attribution fairly

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,240
well

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,480
um everyone knows you know you have your

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,320
license file

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,720
you have your list of licenses that

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,320
accompanies um

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,920
delivery of software i and

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,800
you know if you are if you have an app

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,160
or something you know you go to the menu

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,680
go to legal you go to licenses and then

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,079
you know there's your long list of all

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
of the open source that the app uses

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,800
right

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,680
um i don't think that open data has

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,040
really figured this out uh you see a lot

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,320
of different formats

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,160
um academics have

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,000
used like their you know academic

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,800
citation format

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,520
and other people some people throw their

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,440
open data

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,960
attribution in with their open source

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,880
attribution

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:51,280
um and then other people do

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,280
a lot of different things um

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,480
and as i was saying earlier

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,599
compatibility with

00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,560
other uh licenses is just

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
uh it is not solved and you know this is

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,440
something

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,520
that is an issue in open source too

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,000
where you know the question of what is

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,599
gpl compatible with

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
um you know and like hgpl is like

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,119
compatible

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,160
with like nothing it's you know

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,359
um but

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,800
imagine if you had you know

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:29,359
gpl and then you had another

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,960
uh cheryl type license

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:36,880
where you know there was a lot of code

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,480
in that format and you couldn't use

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,480
those to code under those two licenses

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,480
in the same program right

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,119
so

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,640
um i want to use the open database

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,000
license

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,680
as an example so

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,200
the open database license try to

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,680
solve this problem by

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,320
having two concept one a derivative

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,200
database

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,640
and one a collective database so the

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,839
idea was

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:18,960
a collective database is

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:22,160
if you have data on x and then data on y

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,520
and you use those databases

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,000
alongside each other that was

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,960
a collective database and you did not

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
have share

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:36,160
like obligations um

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,119
but if you mixed those

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,040
uh data type if you mix two data bases

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,480
together if you used

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,079
um if you improved a database

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,800
um use you know you then you were

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:55,520
obligated to share back

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,520
those improvements under odbl

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,079
so openstreetmap

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:08,079
right has which is the the project that

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:12,400
i'm probably involved in um

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,200
has a copyright page it has an faq

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
to explain attribution to explain what

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,839
you can do with the data

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,320
um it has now seven

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,160
sets of community guidelines trying to

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,760
explain the difference between a

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,119
database and a collective database um

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,960
and you know what is

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:38,640
too trivial to require um disclosure

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,320
you know if you uh

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,800
for you know one of these examples right

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,480
if if you

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,800
take um uh

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,880
if you take a map of germany from the

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,440
open from openstreetmap

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:59,040
and then you uh take a map of france

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,079
from some other source and you use that

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,880
for your map

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,920
that's considered a collective database

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,359
there is nothing

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,800
in odbl that

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,839
really says any of that um

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
that is sort of like practical

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,440
considerations

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,640
that the community decided

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,119
thinking okay like it's not you know we

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,640
want

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,160
we want people to use openstreetmap

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,839
um and we don't want to prevent them

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,480
from using openstreetmap just because

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,280
they want to use openstreetmap for one

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,520
country

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,720
but don't want to use openstreetmap for

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,839
another country

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,160
so they decided to make the division at

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,160
the

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,480
country level why the country level

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,560
why not the state level again there's

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,040
like nothing in the license that really

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,040
explains this this was just like a

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,320
practical decision

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,320
that the community made

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,839
the community also made the decision

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,040
that

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,480
um you can if you

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:13,200
use uh the road network

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,319
of map um but you decide to get

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,480
your polygons

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:23,200
of force and parks

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,480
uh from a different source uh that's

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,280
okay

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,640
that's a collective database you're not

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,640
obligated to share back

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,359
your your source of parks

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,000
if you want to layer across your bird

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,440
migration

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,880
patterns on an open street map map

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,000
that's okay that data type you know

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,359
or migration pattern is not

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,839
one that's in openstreetmap so it can be

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,920
considered a separate layer um and

00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,319
therefore a derived database

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,760
whereas if you

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:08,160
uh are using an openstreetmap map

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:11,599
uh and then you decide to

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,319
go in um and add a bunch of roads from

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,119
a new housing development that was just

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,119
built

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:22,160
um then those roads um

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,640
need to be shared back you created your

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,319
database

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:32,880
so you know par so basically

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:37,119
um as far as

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,560
you know where is the line um

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,280
as best i can tell openstreetmap is the

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,319
project

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,319
that has the most detail on this

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:52,000
and they have produced that detail

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,599
out of necessity um because

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,640
the it's not

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:02,480
obvious from just reading

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,200
the text of the license um

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,000
and i don't know that it can ever be

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,000
obvious

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,240
from just reading the text license

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,640
um and and you know to some extent this

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,240
is true open source as well i think

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,760
there were just years and years of

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,839
debates of

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,040
you know what you know what does lgbl

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,480
mean right um

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:32,319
and the people sort of

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,440
ended up with a bunch of conventions

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,319
of how you were supposed to use open

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
source

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,760
and under what circumstances um

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,800
licenses were compatible um

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,119
uh openstreetmap has put out some you

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,760
know

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,720
quote-unquote rulings about what

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,040
licenses

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:59,920
are uh compatible with odbl

00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:03,440
um outbound odl is compatible with

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,480
basically nothing but inbound um

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,640
you know obviously things like

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,839
public domain and such are inbound

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,200
compatible

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,160
by even cc buy isn't deemed inbound

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,280
compatible you

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,319
there's like a weight waiver um

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,839
that you are supposed to get um

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,960
for the drm provision of

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:31,200
ccbi actually

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,000
um so it is a really really complicated

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,680
question

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,280
um and i think it is a bit of a

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,720
cautionary tale

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,560
of if you decide to go into

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,680
the open data space really think about

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,040
all the potential uses um of

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,079
what of the data and

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,760
what limitations you really want

00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,079
um want to have and

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,000
you know what sort of complexity that

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,160
may bring about

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,240
and one thing i will note that uh

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,040
openstreetmap actually started off as a

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,240
cc by

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,720
cc by sa project and

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,480
after a few years they had to change the

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,520
license

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,920
and they had this massive project to try

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,720
to

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,760
chase down literally everybody who had

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,960
edited

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,599
the map um and get them to agree

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,280
to the license change and there were a

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
bunch of people that they never found

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,440
and so they just like deleted all of

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,079
their edits

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,200
and this is very similar to open source

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,720
projects

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,960
that undergo license changes

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,440
and now there is a contributor agreement

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,560
that says that the project can change

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,240
the terms

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:56,720
based on uh a vote

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,720
of uh contributors

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,599
um so a couple other clauses um

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,560
to pay attention to uh that i've seen

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,760
that are

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,319
a little bit odd uh but if you know a

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,839
lawyer

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,839
looks at the license and sees these

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,599
things it definitely

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,119
you know puts a pause on usage um

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
there are some you see this with

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,400
government sometimes where they say

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,920
okay here is the data from x date and if

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,319
you're going to use this data you have

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,599
to

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,359
use the most recent version of it there

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,319
are some governments

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,119
uh especially that'll put out data that

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,720
say

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:44,400
it can only be used in the country

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,240
um that that it originated from

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,200
uh and then there are some license that

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,440
say

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,200
um either that the license can be

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,119
revoked at any time

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,200
or that the license is only good for a

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,640
year or something like that

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,599
um you see a lot of indemnity clauses

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,599
in um

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,760
especially in in government licenses

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,200
uh where a lot of times they're

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
concerned about

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,240
what they're concerned about is if the

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,680
data is inaccurate and

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:21,119
for any reason and then it gets used

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,599
for um

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,160
you know like like somebody uses as the

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,480
basis

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,560
was like a survey or something like that

00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,480
land survey or something like that

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,480
um they you know they don't want to

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,760
get sued and so they're like if you use

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,560
it

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,319
and we get sued then you indemnify us um

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,160
i think

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,359
most companies can get comfortable with

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,240
this um

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,119
just a matter of risk but it is

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,839
something to

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,839
to know about

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:58,000
um another other considerations

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,480
um this is uh depends on the type of

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,280
data

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,119
that you might put out as open data but

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,000
you do really have to be careful

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,920
um about whether there's any uh

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,520
information about individuals

00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,640
in your data um you know names

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:19,119
uh email addresses uh right

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:22,400
um that sort of information uh

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:26,240
and you know uh i think

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,240
for researchers they tend to worry about

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,680
a lot about

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,680
medical data for example

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:40,000
there is sometimes copyright associated

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,040
with individual pieces of a database

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,559
so for example if you have a database of

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,640
photographs

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
there will be copyright for each

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,280
individual photograph

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,400
even if the copyright on

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,440
the grouping

00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,119
is very limited

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:05,040
uh and trademark is uh you know

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,359
similar issues right uh as when you're

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,559
talking about um any information that's

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,240
going out there

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,960
you know who who where is this

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:20,880
originating from who is it responsible

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:23,920
um that sort of thing

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,280
so i you know practical considerations

00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,319
for if you are putting

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,680
data out there um

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,559
i making sure that you have information

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,079
that's clear

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:40,240
um and obvious to the viewer

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:43,839
and to anybody who might download

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:48,160
the data this is just very similar

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:51,839
to open source best practices um

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:54,960
but uh i think you know with

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,319
uh with data and metadata can be very

00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,040
important

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,400
um and also you tend to see a lot of

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,079
academics

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,440
um so academic uh citations

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,680
tends to be a question that comes up a

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,680
lot

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,079
um so when you're using open data

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,280
your considerations are a lot of the

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,280
same

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:24,000
um but i

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,599
your a lot of the concern is about

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,240
finding the information

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,160
on data and this is not always obvious

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,240
sometimes you'll just see

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,839
you know data sitting out there

00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,440
especially if it's coming from a

00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,680
government entity

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:43,040
um a lot of times uh

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,119
these entities don't aren't

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,400
familiar with the concept of open data

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,160
like some

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,520
uh entities like the city of san

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,240
francisco have like a

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,640
you know open data portal it's very easy

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,400
um

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,119
and other entities uh have

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,079
um have like a term sheet or something

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,800
like that

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,440
um and it can really take some digging

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,920
to

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,680
find out this sort of information

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,079
um to figure out uh what the limitations

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,800
are

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,520
um and just because there are so many

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,640
because people

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,520
use open data to mean so many different

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,400
things like

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,520
you know all we just reviewed all these

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,480
different licenses

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,440
right um just because somebody says open

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,800
data doesn't

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,760
necessarily mean it's suitable for

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,760
your use case

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,960
um as i said you know you really want to

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:50,960
um find out what the terms are

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:55,200
and ask you know who produced something

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:58,559
um and and specific restrictions

00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,119
um if you you know one question that i

00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,400
see sometimes um with openstreetmap is

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,000
people will ask

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,079
you know is this uh is the license for

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,839
this data compatible with odbl

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,640
and most of the time the people being

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,920
asked have no idea what odbl is

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,319
so it just ends up not being a useful

00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,319
question

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,119
and of course right this is just best

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,319
practices um

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,839
very similar to open source

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,720
um and making sure that when you're

00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,839
using

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,960
open data you have a good record

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,920
of where you got the data um what

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,920
license it's under

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,359
um and questions

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,839
i have another question if nobody else

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,839
wants to go first

00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:00,559
okay my question is um

00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:03,359
a hard one but to what extent do you see

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,319
share like or copy left data licenses

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,040
being

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,559
effective for their sort of original

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,680
purpose in other words

00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,760
where they they do a better job of

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,960
bringing new contributions into the

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,160
project than they do

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,839
of scaring potential users and

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,839
contributors away from the project

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:29,680
um i think that

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,800
for the most part um

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,760
if you have a license that's

00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,880
too restrictive that will keep people

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,119
away

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:45,440
um i think what you see for example is

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:49,200
you don't is agpl is not

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:52,880
nearly as conducive to

00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:56,079
a large-scale very popular project

00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,359
um as a

00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,760
permissive license right and gpl

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,440
um you know you you have like the huge

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:08,400
example

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:12,839
but you don't have a lot of examples

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:16,079
um and openstreetmap you know struggled

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:20,319
with whether the license

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:24,000
is too restrictive or not

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,200
um there are definitely circumstances

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,319
where

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,960
you know open street map data

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,000
might be used for something but it's not

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,640
used

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,280
uh because it's not compatible with

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,280
other data

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,720
that that's available

00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,839
but for but it does

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,720
it does force um people

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,280
uh you know especially companies to to

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,599
make this

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,319
choice right of like either you're kind

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,720
of all in

00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,720
or you're not um because if you're

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,240
if you want to use the data then you're

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,520
gonna need to contribute

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,079
resources to improving that data um

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,280
because you know you you want a better

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,359
map

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:16,480
um and you then you have to give back

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:19,680
um those improvements uh

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,760
but like i said openstreetmap found

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,040
basically that cc by sa was too

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,240
restrictive

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,520
and that's why it moved to odbl

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,599
um and at the time that it moved to odbl

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,960
there were people who were saying you

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,880
know this should be

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,920
like ccpi um

00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:43,280
and so you know my view is the most

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,640
restrictive uh data license

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,839
really just aren't usable um

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,640
and the an odbl is

00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,000
only usable for certain types of

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,359
projects

00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,359
um you know

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,200
openstreetmap has a lot of individual

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,640
contributors it also has

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,640
a lot of companies that are

00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:10,880
coordinating um

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:14,720
i wouldn't recommend it for a project

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,280
that is um a lot of different company

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,960
like just

00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,640
just like a few companies working

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,480
together primarily

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:25,440
i think those companies could just um

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,160
write like a data sharing agreement

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,160
between them

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,000
and i think for in general for for like

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,559
a project where

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,920
um you know you just are putting some

00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,960
data out there and you want people to

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,000
use it

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,480
um i think you're better off using the

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,599
more permissive

00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,680
licenses great thank you

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,280
uh we do have a question now from a

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,799
participant um

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,200
kevin do you want to go ahead and ask

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,200
yourself

00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:03,040
sure hi kathleen um so one

00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,520
one question that's kind of a tangent i

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,920
guess

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,240
to to how you're describing the success

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,599
of these open data projects

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,280
have you seen any examples where as

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,640
instead of providing just access to the

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,480
raw data under whatever license

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,880
you provide access to the data via

00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,559
specific access patterns you know apis

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,680
and that sort of thing

00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,599
um and by this

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,359
by the same token you know if you ask

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,200
for contributions back to your data

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:37,040
you provide specific access patterns um

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:39,520
to do that i'm sure

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,240
yeah so those things are not mutually

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,440
exclusive

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,559
right um you can access openstreetmap

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,280
via

00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,799
api um you can also just download the

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,319
entire planet file that

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:55,200
takes a while but

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,119
you know sometimes what you do see

00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,799
especially with government

00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,760
for example is they will have their data

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,280
viewable

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:08,319
um through like their own viewer uh

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,960
on their website um and such i i don't

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,000
consider

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,319
that to be open data if it's sort of

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,880
like

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,520
subject to the terms and services you

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,920
know

00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,640
terms of service of the website or

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,799
whatever

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:26,559
right um you can you can ping the data

00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:28,480
um you can get the data uh

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,079
i don't really consider that very

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,200
different than

00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,960
kind of any website uh where there's

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,920
information on the website

00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,240
um it might be easy to scrape it might

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,920
be

00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,640
hard to scrape uh it's in a lot of ways

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,760
just a

00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,280
standard terms of service gotcha no yeah

00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,119
i mean we were specifically looking at

00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,839
some scenarios where we would

00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,599
um potentially open source the data

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,520
access method itself for example

00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,880
all the apis and so forth and provide

00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,040
you know something more along the lines

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,000
of a kafka streaming subscription type

00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,960
of a thing

00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,160
right so that um it it would go a lot

00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,040
further than

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,480
than just um what you could get through

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,880
scraping for example you know you could

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,880
get

00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,559
larger volumes of data it's just because

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,079
of the the data itself

00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:21,920
is intrinsically difficult to interpret

00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:24,160
providing it in specific um formats

00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,640
would be extremely helpful for consumers

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,440
is kind of the way we were looking at it

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,760
yeah and

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,920
you know that that can definitely be the

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,680
case for certain types of data

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,280
and like i said right i don't think it's

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,240
a either or

00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,040
um providing data in a more useful

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,640
format

00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,680
like based on um what the user queries

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:49,760
uh you know that that can be

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,160
very helpful um and i if your goal is to

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,520
make

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:56,799
the data more accessible then

00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,520
i think that it's best to have both

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,119
options available um you know you can

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:05,760
have the api

00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:08,000
where people can have ease of

00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,280
both getting the information and adding

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,640
information right so like with

00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,400
openstreetmap

00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:18,480
um you can get a stream

00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:21,280
of change sets of every minute

00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,720
every all the edits that are have been

00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,000
added to the map

00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,640
and when you make a change to the map

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,599
that gets sent to the map as a change

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,839
set

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,440
right and and then the map is

00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:35,839
immediately updated

00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,280
so you're not you know downloading and

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:40,240
uploading

00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,359
the entire planet um or anything like

00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,319
that

00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,079
but you can you can and go get the

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,359
entire thing um

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,799
if if you want gotcha okay yeah that's

00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,359
that that makes sense i appreciate

00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,359
the discussion

00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,720
um other questions okay well we are past

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,799
the hour so

00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,079
um i i guess if you are if you are a

01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,799
game to stick around for those

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,200
who are around and still have questions

01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,839
um

01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,440
then i i will say that you know folks

01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,960
can stick around if they'd like to

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,720
um but i i wanted to take the

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,920
opportunity to say thank you so much for

01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,040
joining us this is a terrific

01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,359
presentation

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,640
um i think you estimated that you no way

01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:21,839
you would go 40 minutes

01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:24,559
uh to me before this presentation but

01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:26,000
clearly we we we made it to the end so

01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,799
thank you so much for joining us i

01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,960
appreciate your

01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,559
sharing your expertise oh thanks for

01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,119
having me

01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,119
absolutely

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,240
if anybody has any any lasting questions

01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,520
let me ask

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,480
yeah if i may ask uh caitlin

01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,640
yeah thank you so much for the

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,319
presentation and i think

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,760
we are now thinking about some of this

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,880
data protection

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,400
regulation coming up right uh gdpr

01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,079
the uh the from california as well

01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,680
i'm from brazil i work for brazilian

01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,599
bank and there's also a regulation for

01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:03,839
data protection do you see that

01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,680
this open beta licenses has

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,440
picked up because of this data

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,280
protection regulation

01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,160
that people need to know where the data

01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,119
came from how the data is being used

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,680
and as consumer of proprietary data of

01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,000
data in general you see companies

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,200
putting together into the same big

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,359
initiative to see data

01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:30,400
clobberiness as a whole um

01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,720
i don't think that open data has picked

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,400
up

01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:38,319
because of data privacy laws

01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,160
um i think that there is um

01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:43,040
a consideration there should be a

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:46,400
consideration of data privacy laws

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,400
when one opens up data

01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,839
like you have to think about what type

01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,400
of data you're opening up

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,240
and whether the data you have is

01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,440
suitable for opening up given data

01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,440
privacy laws

01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,839
but i don't see people moving to open

01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,000
data because of data privacy laws is

01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,160
that your questions

01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,119
i see it understood yeah i see

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,680
interesting

01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,640
initiatives like i guess was mastercard

01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,240
that was selling there

01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:17,760
anonymize anonymized data right

01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,640
so in that regard if you treat the data

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,359
even though it's from customers or from

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,799
other

01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:28,480
sources uh would you still be

01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:29,839
subject to it depends on the license

01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,440
right of the

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:35,520
maybe the source right yeah but as

01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,599
yeah i don't have a straightforward

01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,799
question but i was thinking about

01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,119
how people has monetizing on data and

01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,079
how

01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,359
sometimes they anonymize customers data

01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,400
and other data

01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:52,960
uh from other sources and how

01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:56,640
the open data plays a role in it

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:59,280
um yeah so data anonymization

01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,280
um you know the the privacy

01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,400
consideration there is you have to do it

01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:06,160
in the right way

01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,359
um you have to you don't

01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,000
data protection laws are look are look

01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:13,920
starting to look harder and harder at

01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
are you actually anonymizing

01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:21,200
that data um that you're selling and

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,680
from the perspective of the data privacy

01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,280
laws

01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:28,240
of like you know what is concerning

01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,960
whether that data is being sold or that

01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,680
data

01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,119
is freely available you know those

01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,400
privacy concerns are

01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,680
are still there um many years ago

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,640
there was um a

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,079
web uh i think it was all but i might it

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,640
might have been a different company but

01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,000
put out

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,640
um a giant data piece based of people's

01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,960
web searches uh and it wasn't on rise

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,680
there was no names attached to it

01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,280
but what researchers found was based on

01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,520
somebody's web searches they could

01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,720
figure out who these people are and

01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,400
track them down

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,760
um and they went and interviewed this

01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,680
one old lady

01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,799
who had you know searched for like her

01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,079
her friends and like their illnesses

01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:15,680
like their their medical complaints um

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,319
and search her address

01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,280
you know and and search their neighbors

01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,200
uh and the

01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,480
reporters found her in an interviewed

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,839
her

01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:29,280
um and so you know that data it

01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:32,480
i'm sure there is monetization potential

01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,000
for that type of data but in that case

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,119
the company put it out there thinking

01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,559
that it would be interesting to

01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,599
researchers so they put it out there for

01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,559
free

01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,200
um and they learned a lesson about you

01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,119
know

01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,720
privacy considerations and i think

01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,160
everybody learned a lesson about privacy

01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,160
considerations coming out of that

01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:55,839
let's see understood

01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,839
yeah thank you very much

01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,680
