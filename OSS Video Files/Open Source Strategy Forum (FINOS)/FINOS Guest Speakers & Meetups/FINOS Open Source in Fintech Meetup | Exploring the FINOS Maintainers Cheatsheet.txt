an

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,520
engineer or a developer and so now

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,599
rather than passing over to somebody

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,599
else i'm actually going to be talking

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,280
and taking everybody through exploring

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,280
the finnish maintainers cheat sheet

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,200
so um on the 10th of september

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,400
finnos had its all community call which

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,959
we do

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,840
basically every quarter um we bring the

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,920
finnos

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
community plus the open source community

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,720
together

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
to take people through everything that

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,519
we've been achieving

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,120
throughout the quarter of that year

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,040
now during that session we had the

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
finnos maintainers cheat sheet which was

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,200
added to it but we didn't get the

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
opportunity to go through it in as much

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,920
detail as we would have liked to

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
um because of the other content that was

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,840
there

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,680
and so this afternoon both myself and

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
also mel who's on the call

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
um we'll be taking you through the

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,159
finnos maintainers cheat sheet

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
which we've created in order to make the

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,879
finnos maintainers

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,120
life a little bit easier so

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,800
throughout the course of the next maybe

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
20 minutes

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
we'll be going through all five of these

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,040
areas

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
the first being integrating continuous

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,159
integration and deployment onto finos

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,879
project builds

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
the second is publishing documentation

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,080
from github repositories

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
to finos project websites and then we're

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
going to go through

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,319
running project meetings using um

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
including agendas and recording

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,040
attendance and publishing minutes

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,879
using github um and then we'll be

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,239
talking about security

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,959
and responsible disclosure

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,920
and then as a maintainer how to grow

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,239
maturity

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
viability and and the value of your

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
project

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,599
but rather than go through it from this

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
powerpoint slide

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,480
where i would like to take you next is

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,840
the link up here which is the abp

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,360
micro site so if i click on here

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,280
we go into a browser and this is where

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
today's session turns into something

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
which is very much like

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
uh one of the finals project working

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
group pools that we have

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,320
um where you are right now is on the

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
open developer platform

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,960
um microsite and open the plat

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
developer platform is actually one of

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,800
the projects where

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,759
incidentally um we're running a session

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,360
this afternoon

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
um pretty much straight after this

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,840
session now

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
within the top right of the microsite

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
you'll notice

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,919
that there's a docs link and within

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,639
that docs link we explain what odp is

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,919
um so if you'd like to go and learn more

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,120
about odp

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,000
um i'll drop that link in the chat

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
but down the left hand side under our

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,880
getting started

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
we've actually added the finnos

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,000
maintainers cheat sheet

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,880
to the odp website which means that

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
we've now broken outside of google

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
slides

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,800
and you can follow along with me if you

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,520
choose to

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,240
locally um which is awesome and so

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,360
something else that i would also like to

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
let you know because

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,160
we are an open source foundation and if

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,199
you have any other questions outside of

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
this meeting

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:35,199
um feel free to open an issue on the odp

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,199
issues board which i've also

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,280
just opened for you where

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,440
you can ask any questions about um the

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,039
content that i'm about to go through and

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,600
also get involved with odp so

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,360
the first uh question as a maintainer

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
that we're about to answer

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
is integrating continuous integration

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,000
and deployment

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,280
into thinos project builds

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,520
and uh within

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
the open developer platform we like to

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,759
make sure that not only

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,039
are we there to help you integrate into

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
odp

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
but we also give you all of the

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,039
integration instructions

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
and lots of different tutorials at the

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,919
same time

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
and so you'll notice that this is also

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,199
broken into

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
our development infrastructure

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
continuous integration

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
and um continuous integration through

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
various different

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,120
technologies in use so at the moment

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,199
we are um advocating that um

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
continuous integration and deployment is

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,280
actually done through github actions

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,319
um and this is also covered um through

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
uh a platform that we've created or a

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
project that we've

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,000
created um called the finnos project

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
blueprint

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
and the finnos project blueprint is our

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,680
starting point um

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
for all of the various different

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,080
projects that we have um

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
within finos it basically gives

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
everybody a template

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
of a lot of the things that we're about

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,880
to talk about this afternoon

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,720
um including you know some placeholders

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,400
for um building and deploying

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,240
um uh and a finnos

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,080
microsite for your project as well so

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
maybe mel if you would like to talk

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,400
through a little bit more about you know

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,479
the way that we actually use actions and

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
maybe give a couple of examples of the

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,880
actions that we

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,800
um deploy and advocate that would be

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
awesome

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,560
yeah sure i'll try to be brief um uh

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,560
it could be a long conversation but and

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,520
actually you did a great introduction

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
right first of all i would like to

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
remark

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
uh what what james mentioned before we

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,240
advocate

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,160
uh ci solutions as any other

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
solution that is involved in the

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,960
pipelines that we're showing

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
however we are clearly open to work with

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,599
the team

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,440
and introduce new systems or provide

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,599
guidance on how to configure

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
github actions or any other solution in

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,479
in different ways than

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,360
than the ones currently documented

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,319
right now uh we are advocating github

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
actions

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,479
uh in the past we worked a lot with

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,800
travis ci

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
and when we say we work with it means

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
that

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,320
we have seen many projects adopting dci

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,039
and therefore

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
we followed this trend uh it's a

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,919
community

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
led if you want a trend that we follow

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,200
and we

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
happen to use github actions also to

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,040
develop our intern

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,839
internal automation so for meeting

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,240
attendance

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,000
we have created the github action we

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,120
have a github action that

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,640
helps with deployment of websites built

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
in docusaurus

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
and actually it is involved with the

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,080
deployment of the website that you

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,120
that you see in odp.finos.org

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,640
and so we actually see power on

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
champagne how people say some people say

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,279
it

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,720
um and the other thing that maybe

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,480
will is interesting to notice in the ci

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,959
aspect of the build pipeline

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
is that continuous integration uh

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
changes a lot

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,480
depending on the platform and language

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,160
being adopted and so

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,720
we um we we tend to provide

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
documentation based on which language or

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,760
platform is used

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
uh currently we we have built a really

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
good

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
experience documentation and

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,560
infrastructure for

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,519
java node and

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,959
let's say a second stage c sharp and

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,920
python

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,959
nevertheless we have project single

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,680
closure

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
which is also quite well supported we we

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,160
have

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
quite some some logic internal logic

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,399
enclosure

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,600
i like closure um and uh

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,000
yeah so that's pretty much it um

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
i know this is a large topic so i would

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
like to

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,800
actually ask participants of this call

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,200
to drop questions or even interest

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,839
in the chat because that would really

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
help us

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,920
a lot understanding you know

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
where which direction we have to take

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
and

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,079
where we should look at thank you james

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
back to you

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,839
yeah absolutely and so thank you very

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
much for that introduction now

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,360
and um in the spirit of teamwork what

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
i've actually done

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,079
is um presented people with um so going

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,600
back to the cheat sheet

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,399
um we actually uh linked out to

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
the odp documentation around continuous

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
integration

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,000
um where mao did explain a couple of

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,959
examples of where we're

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,600
um where we provide um integration

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,720
points

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,240
um and build points for a couple of um

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,399
areas within finos um and so i

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,079
basically want to show you what um these

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,360
areas are so

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,360
project blueprint is kind of like the um

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,440
cookie cutter for all of the various

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,000
open source projects that we have

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,839
within finos and so you'll notice that

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
um up here we've got a green button that

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,360
says use this template

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
um which means when we get new

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
contributions

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
we use the project project blueprint to

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
create our new projects and so whether

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,640
you're looking at

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,200
um glue or you know any of the other new

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,200
contributions that have come into finos

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
the projects would have been built using

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
this template here

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,079
which gives us a lot of different um

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,200
assets to play with

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,839
um including the first one which is the

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,040
docusaurus github action

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,000
that mao um discussed

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,040
now docusaurus and we'll also cover that

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,560
a little bit later

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,240
is um the way that we link up

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,079
all of our repositories um documentation

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,680
so all of the markdown files that are

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,560
within your docs folder

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,600
with our microsites so all of this

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,399
content within

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
the open developer platform microsite is

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,040
actually built using

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,440
docusaurus which is a react.js framework

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,399
and in order for that to become

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,560
continuous

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,000
with all of our pull requests and all of

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,040
the merges

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,079
we have a docusaurus build

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,920
action which fires and then creates the

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,320
next version of the website

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,880
which is absolutely brilliant um and

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,959
that means that for every version of um

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
documentation and build we have within

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,760
our projects

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
we get a new version of the of the

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,560
microsite which is hosted

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,839
and displayed using docusaurus um

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,839
and then later on we're going to be

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
talking about how we actually host our

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,920
meetings and we actually use github

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,839
github issues um for

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
putting all of our meetings together

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
driving our agendas and taking our

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
minutes

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,040
plus we use a meetings um action

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,160
um for taking a look at which of our

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,800
members have actually

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,360
um joined and which of our you know

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,800
project team members are actually in the

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,720
um project and this helps us aggregate

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,240
um a lot of information that we use

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
within the foundation

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,800
um to measure the success of our

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,959
projects and so cicd is something that

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
we use a lot if these aren't the only

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,839
two things that we use

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,000
um and so feel free to drop your um

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,839
questions in chat you know if you have

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
any further questions about how we use

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,399
ci cd within finos

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,040
but from the finnos maintainers um cheat

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,800
sheet

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,480
you can also find all of the

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,800
documentation that mao

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
went through around continuous

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,279
integration how to use it

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,399
using travis how we're using it using

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,120
github actions

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,959
etc and then all of the various

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,639
different technologies that we've also

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,600
been supporting as well

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
using ci cd and so we hope that all of

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
this

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,000
these docu all of this documentation

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,440
will be very helpful

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,240
for our maintainers

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,800
now this actually brings us into the

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,720
next

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,360
um part of the cheat sheet which is

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
how we actually publish all of our

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,639
project documentation from

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,560
our repositories um because

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
as a lot of engineering teams have

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
learned um

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
if you can keep all of the information

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,040
about your project close to your code

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,800
it makes you more efficient you know

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
being an engineering team

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,839
so if you've got your your project

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,320
documentation

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
across multiple sources you know it

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
actually um

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
creates a lot of context switching which

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,959
isn't very good for you

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,320
for the team you know plus also your

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,079
documentation

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,639
comes out of sync with your project

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,279
builds especially if you're using agile

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,880
and documentation is part of you know

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,079
your definition of done

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
um so in order to make sure the

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,839
documentation

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
supports all of our various open source

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,440
projects

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,959
as i was talking about before we use

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,240
docusaurus which um

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:25,440
is actually a framework created by

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,000
facebook written in react specifically

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,079
for open source projects

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,800
now all of the um microsites that we

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,639
have

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,920
within finos use docusaurus so odp uses

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,600
docusaurus

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,920
um fdc3 also uses docusaurus

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
all the way through we follow this same

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,519
type of pattern

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,839
um now within um all of our repositories

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:57,279
so if i go to

00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:00,000
github um open developer platform

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,639
you will notice that um there are two

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,680
folders

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,440
that relate to the microsites and also

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,480
the documentation within it

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,720
so the website folder here

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,040
is where docusaurus actually lives and

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,639
so if you are a javascript developer

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,880
um who's used to using um you know yarn

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
and

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,839
npm and you know webpack for building

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,720
your projects this will be very familiar

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
with for you within that node.js um kind

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,000
of world

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
if you are a developer who doesn't want

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,920
to get involved in front-end websites

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,800
then that's absolutely fine as well

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,320
or if you're a project manager or if

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
you're a business analyst

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,399
um who wants to work within

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,839
documentation rather than code

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:49,279
this docs docs folder is where

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,480
you can also live with your team so if i

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,320
drag

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,399
this uh tab over to the

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,639
um open developer platform microsite

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,639
you will notice that there are various

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,160
different um

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,600
uh markdown files so if i go to

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,319
finnos maintain a cheat sheet

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,319
you'll notice that the information

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
that's actually within this markdown

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,520
file

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,480
is actually the same information that's

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,520
displayed

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,439
when you come here um

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
and it and to be quite honest it is it

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,880
is exactly the same

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,039
and so within the repository this is a

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,400
markdown representation

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,840
using your repository like a cms

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,120
which then gets built using the action

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,160
that i showed earlier for docusaurus

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,320
into your microsite now it just so

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,520
happens that this

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,760
particular piece of um markdown has been

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,039
placed into the getting started tab

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,000
or getting started at um section um

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,440
of the odp microsite but if you look

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,080
through

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
so if i hit back on here you'll notice

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,320
that there is actually a subfolder

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,799
called development infrastructure

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,400
and this actually follows um the same

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,440
navigational path or

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,799
tree or hierarchy um through here

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,760
so code validation just happens to be

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,400
here

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,600
and then under code validation you have

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,360
all of your various

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,160
different um content so node security

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,200
for instance so hopefully there's a node

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,400
security

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,640
section and so this

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
markdown representation that you have

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,520
with your code and with your project

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
team

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,919
then gets built using an action and

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,520
placed into the microsite so you get a

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,760
high fidelity

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,880
searchable microsite for not only

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,440
advertising your project but also

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
delivering all of your project

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
documentation

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,880
to the outside world you know so people

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,520
who don't live in github

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,559
can navigate to you know your microsite

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,600
in order to

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,280
just to see this now

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,559
as part of the cheat sheet so if i

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,840
um find that

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,480
we have provided the link here so

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,200
if i close these links so people don't

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
um

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,880
get confused this shows all of our

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,280
maintainers

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
how to actually engage with creating

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,000
this type of microsite

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,039
you know for your projects and

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,520
this type of micro site um is also part

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,480
of

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,160
the project blueprint so if you use

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,280
blueprint as a template

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,400
you get a very kind of um first

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
uh build of a new microsite for your

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,440
project

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
and then you can use this documentation

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,919
in order to

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,320
configure your project um and then start

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
using that way of unifying your project

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,840
documentation

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,039
with your microsite now mal i don't know

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
if i've missed anything

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,640
or if you would like to cover anything

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,679
else on that or if people have got

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,200
questions

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,200
feel free to place them in chat

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,360
i think you did a really good job

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,280
thank you no there's nothing to add on

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,880
my side thanks

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,679
brilliant okay so moving on to the third

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
row here um this is actually something

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,799
that

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,640
is quite new for us you know we've been

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,400
doing it for a few months but a lot of

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,520
our projects are just moving in this

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
direction

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
and that is actually running um our

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
project

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,840
meetings um so if your project comes

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,640
together for a call

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
and you need to provide an agenda um and

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
also

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,840
provide meeting minutes after that call

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,919
we used to create

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:53,039
our minutes and also our agendas in jira

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,080
which um actually led to more context

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,679
switching

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:02,720
and so what we actually do now is um

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:07,200
run all of our meetings using

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:11,520
github issues so if i go to

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:15,039
github open developer platform again

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,679
issues this afternoon we have

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,840
an odp meeting so you know you can see

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,440
that the open developer platform

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,960
um as a a project is very active within

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
the issues because we're very

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
communicative and we like

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,039
uh the community to get involved in our

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,320
work but here you'll notice the

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,880
the filter or the label meeting and if i

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
open that

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,360
this afternoon's meeting is actually

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
being created

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,559
by mao who will be running this

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,320
afternoon's meeting

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,960
and through this particular issue

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,679
on github which i'll put into chat as

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,799
well

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,760
you'll notice that um we place our

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,919
agenda here

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,360
we've got check boxes that allows us to

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,120
tick off when we've actually covered

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,360
these items

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,799
plus we've got the various different

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,280
webex information

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,000
so very much like this cool you can jump

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,679
on the webex

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,440
you can see us you can engage with us

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
you can get involved you know you can

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,760
feedback

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,559
you can take on tasks um but ultimately

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,080
um you can also we can also track our

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,120
attendance on here

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,559
so if i say hello and

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,760
um give a little wave uh using

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,480
the wave emoji this is now

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,919
a way that we are encouraging all of the

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
finnos community

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,679
um who are getting involved in our

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,360
project meetings

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,280
the number one um sign up to github

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,799
because in order to be able to place a

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,600
comment there you

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,360
need a github profile and say this is me

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
um

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,440
and then number two if you've never used

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,159
github before this also gives us the

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,320
opportunity

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
to teach people you know how to engage

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,520
in issues and how to

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,559
you know leave comments etc and so after

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,400
the actual meeting has run um

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,120
we then close this particular issue

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,159
so that meetings ended and that actually

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,720
triggers

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
um the github action that i showed you

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
earlier

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,039
around meeting attendance and then

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,039
we can then aggregate who's been on our

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,799
project tools and make sure that we

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,960
you know can engage with the community

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,000
after the project as well

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,080
so now um feel free to you know

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
add more about you know how we're

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,760
actually using github

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,280
to run our meetings and how we're using

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
actions to aggregate

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
all of our various different tracking

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
and you know all of the various

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,240
different

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:48,240
um uh metrics that we're accumulating

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,360
yeah i mean yeah and again you did a

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,919
great job here

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
um there's not much to say of course

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,720
there is more color

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,760
to the to the feature we have a way to

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,159
unindex and re-index data in case of

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,320
uh typos we identify unknown identities

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,600
and the action drops a comment there is

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,120
some automation there

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,840
but you know the juicy part is what you

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,440
said

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,799
one quick note may be that

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,559
we track this information because

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,880
we care a lot about metrics and because

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,520
we

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,880
consider ourselves a data-driven

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,840
organization right so

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,840
if you can open a tab james on

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:38,640
metrics.finos

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:43,679
that is probably what i would like

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,679
people to see when we talk about metrics

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,919
and this is publicly available right

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,159
everyone can go

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,360
on this on this board and play with our

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
data

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,720
part of this data is meeting attendance

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,440
as you can see

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
right at the bottom at the bottom right

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,000
of the screen

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,159
yeah meetings attempted so that is

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,039
actually that num those numbers are fed

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,279
by

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,400
by the github action that james has

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,720
shown you

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,480
right that's awesome so i don't know if

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,600
um whilst i go back

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,400
because what i did um was trigger the

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,679
action

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,320
um so mao actually spoke about you know

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
triggering an action and collecting that

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,880
data

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,440
so we can actually present it you know

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,679
externally to the finnos community

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,919
um i actually triggered that action by

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,039
closing this issue

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,200
and what that actually did um was

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,440
trigger an action within the actions tab

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,559
with github

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,559
which was that that meetings um

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,720
action that i showed previously i can

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,799
show you uf again but you'll notice that

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,360
all of the various different tasks

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,640
that are set out in that um action have

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,279
been triggered

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,880
um and the very last task that gets

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,799
triggered

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,880
is this indexed label which allows us

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,520
to then know that that meeting has been

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,720
indexed

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,600
which is brilliant but then if um for

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,200
whatever reason

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,760
after indexing so if we need to re-index

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,320
and then run that action again we can

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,360
then

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,200
um remove that index and then

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,120
add it again and then that will

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,600
re-trigger that action

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,480
and so this is a great interactive way

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,640
for us to

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,080
number one you know get people using

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,799
comments number two

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,559
um communicate what actions are and how

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,480
they're triggered and what they do

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,080
um and then number three keep our

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,440
community updated

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,919
through our metrics um so now

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,559
or grizz or somebody on the pool if you

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,440
would like to

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,080
share the metrics um url that'd be great

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,360
um this one's a little bit long

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,440
um thank you aaron for asking a question

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,279
um we'll cue that one up and we'll come

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,279
back to it if that's okay in our q a

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,440
so within um the actual uh

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,039
documentation that we provided um the

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,039
community

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,039
we've got a couple of links in here

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,320
the second of which is you know how we

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,679
actually

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,799
uh technically engage

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,679
in that piece of functionality that

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,880
um we just demonstrated so how we're

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,480
using actions

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,799
you know how you actually trigger them

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,919
how you index how you unindex and

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,039
then re-index it's all within

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,919
the odp um documentation under meeting

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,760
minutes

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,440
which you can see here so mouse put a

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,919
lot of work into making sure

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,200
that you know our maintainers know how

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
this actually works

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,640
even though we do you know help our

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,760
teams integrate it as well

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,000
but the very first um bullet um

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,200
here is actually around meeting

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,559
procedures

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,000
and this is where technology

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,960
meets open source foundation and

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,840
governance and you know setting out the

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,080
expectations for maintainers on how

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,679
our meetings you know should be run you

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
know because we like to make sure that

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,440
um

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,000
you know as people join the foundation

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,399
and as

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,320
they start running projects we provide

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,360
as much information about how to do that

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,159
as possible

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,120
and so the first link is actually um

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,600
into all of our

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,320
meeting procedure documentation so

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
people know

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
how to run a meeting and then the rest

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,919
of it

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,679
is you know about the technology that we

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
you know give to people to make sure

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
that

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,080
you can run it in the way that you know

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,159
we're setting out here as well

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,600
and so we like to cover you know both

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,159
angles in terms of

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,200
the how to run a meeting and then also

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,640
provide the tools

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,679
through odp on running the meeting

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,279
now this then brings me to the

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,799
fourth row um so thank you aaron

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,880
please keep your questions coming and

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,919
we'll come back to them

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,159
the next one is about um security um

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,840
and how we make sure that um you know

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,880
we're keeping people

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,159
and banks and our projects and

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
all of the developers who are

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,360
contributing to projects

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,480
safe in an open source environment

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,080
so the very first link

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,120
in here is um out to white source

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,159
which is actually um a code

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,880
scanning and vulnerability um software

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
that we use

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,960
within our projects to make sure you

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,440
know malicious

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,240
libraries and codes and builds aren't

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,039
consumed

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
you know within our builds um at build

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,880
time

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,279
so now i don't want to do a disservice

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
to

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,399
explaining white source maybe you would

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,159
like to give us an overview of white

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,399
source and how it's integrated into our

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,799
projects

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,440
sure and i'll uh and i'll also try to

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,480
answer

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,919
aaron's question as it might be uh it

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,880
may be connected

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,320
uh to this conversation so um white

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,960
source does a lot of things

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,600
right uh it is a quite comprehensive

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,720
tool

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,159
for security and compliance

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,159
scanning the way we use

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,679
white source because we also combine

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,720
other tools

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,760
is identifying

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,399
cvs across our

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,320
across projects transitive dependencies

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,360
whether they're direct or indirect

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,440
so we want to make sure that

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,960
the software that is released under the

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,520
finos umbrella

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,520
is safe and secure and this is a

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
scanning that happens that is enforced

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,240
at contribution time

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:47,120
and ongoing uh especially for

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,240
uh in particular for uh projects that

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,320
want to request the activation badge

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,679
the the requirement will be that they

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,050
can document

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,679
that they are cv free um

00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,960
[Music]

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,519
so again it provides also other features

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,640
around

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,679
legal um

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,720
and license scanning um

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,360
we we tend we tend to use others other

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,159
tools

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,880
and have a more much more you know

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,399
manual

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,559
scanning to ensure that there is no uh

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,000
no there are no legal issues uh with the

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,000
code

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,360
but yeah that's that's pretty much it

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and and to our

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,080
and to arthur's question right uh how

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
did you choose the tool set at high

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,000
level

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,399
what were you optimizing for open source

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,240
versus proprietary security ease of use

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,760
etc so let me start saying

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,480
that the tool set at the beginning

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,039
started

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,679
reacting to the project's requests right

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,519
so

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:55,840
we started onboarding projects in java

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:59,279
we would you know provide the tooling

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,640
or develop the tooling to support

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,240
that team that that initiate um

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,080
so we we we grew quite strong on

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,000
java and and node at the beginning

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,320
because those were the languages that

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,320
uh when involved in our projects were

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,279
used in our projects then in the second

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,360
stage

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,120
we saw vendors joining the open

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,039
developer platform initiative like

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,360
github white source and reddit

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,240
so they provided us infrastructure and

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,559
we actually

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,640
kind of worked with them to adapt this

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,720
offering um

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,679
but again we are we're constantly

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,720
evolving

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,880
uh that we definitely have a direction

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,640
so the back to your question what were

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,760
you optimizing for

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,240
and that is security what i just said

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,279
about

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,080
around white source uh legal

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,880
license scanning uh intellectual

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,760
property

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,200
uh checks or validation to avoid

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,559
violations

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,519
um and the quality right where quality

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,559
is probably

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,760
you know the most generic one

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,399
we i kind of like the the vision of

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,360
sonar cloud if you are familiar with it

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,960
where you can define

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,919
quality gates and they have different

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,559
metrics and they also provide like some

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,840
kind of static code scanning uh to

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,679
measure quality

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,279
uh but these are definitely the

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,559
directions and

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,840
and i i hope that the odp homepage

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,600
you know kind of delivers this message

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,840
but that's also the type of feedback we

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,120
are probably looking for

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,960
um if if that it comes kind of unclear

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,760
from our documentation please let us

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,080
know because

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
there's probably space for improvement

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,240
absolutely

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,279
that's it james nice thank you very much

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,360
and um what i

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,120
want to do is uh round off you know

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,679
talking about security

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,360
um by talking about our responsible

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,360
disclosure policy

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,720
now i've dropped a link to that um

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,760
within finland's chat

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,880
um but basically uh responsible

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,440
disclosure

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,320
is um how you actually communicate to a

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,440
team

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,480
um that you found a vulnerability within

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,200
a live project without actually you know

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,599
kind of over alerting the industry to

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,079
that

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,480
you know vulnerability that's been found

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,200
now i won't go into too much detail

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,960
about it

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,480
um because you know looking at the time

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,599
we are actually you know

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,839
covering a lot of detail um but we do

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,200
have um various different procedures

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,399
that we actually

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,599
uh communicate and teach our lead our

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,000
maintainers

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,240
you know just in case the community does

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,520
find a vulnerability and needs to

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,760
communicate that

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,520
without actually writing a github issue

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
that could actually

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,760
inform bad actors about it so if you're

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,720
interested

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,560
um about how we handle um responsible

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,359
disclosure and security

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,800
um you can find that within the actual

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,599
finos wiki

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,240
that i've put within um our chat here

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,000
and we do

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,520
cover all of the various different

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
scenarios in here

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,760
including you know how you actually get

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,839
in contact with help of philosoph

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
and we put you know you in contact with

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,480
the team so you can discuss that

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,079
between you and the team rather than you

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,119
know putting it into a github issue

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,200
so finally as

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,280
a maintainer you are also

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,560
wanting to grow the success of your

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,920
project

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,680
and we actually do that by mentoring and

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,680
coaching our maintainers

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:39,440
um on the finos project life cycle

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,000
um which um mao actually um

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,520
mentioned earlier that we have badges um

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,200
on a lot of our projects

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,200
so if i go to

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:55,359
github.com fdc3

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,880
for instance you'll notice within the

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,359
project readme

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,359
we have various different badges in here

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,880
that you know relate to the state of the

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,839
project at that time

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,119
and one of those badges is um the life

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,720
cycle badge

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,800
um and as you can see um fdc3 is an

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,520
active project

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,200
now when a project actually enters the

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,960
foundation

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,839
as uh documented within

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,800
our governance it actually enters the

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,920
project

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,440
as an incubating project because we

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,800
recognize that um

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,560
not all projects that enter the

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,599
foundation will have the same level of

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,680
maturity

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,079
as one that's been you know within the

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,160
foundation for a while

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,160
and this allows projects to find their

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,560
feet it allows us to give you know

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,599
coaching and guidance on how to set up

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,320
your you know

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,599
backlogs your kanban boards you know

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,680
your release cycles

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,960
cicd and everything that you need to be

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,119
successful

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,079
um and we do have um lifecycle criteria

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,440
that projects

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,359
need to actually hit

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,440
in order to start progressing

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,040
through the various different life cycle

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,079
checks checkpoints so

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,960
forming projects which is optional

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,599
is pre kind of contribution so we work

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,599
with them

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,720
a lot of projects before they've been

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,359
contributed

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,359
to make sure that they're fit and ready

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,520
and happy to be contributed

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,280
when the project has been contributed

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,040
you go into incubating

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,040
where we get you up and running and make

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,599
sure that you feel confident about

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,480
you know how your project um is actually

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,640
being run

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,680
both um in terms of project management

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,960
and also

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,200
development and release etc then when

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,839
you film pass through our activation

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,480
checklist you then become an active

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,440
project

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,760
which is um an active project is very

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,680
you know

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,839
fully formed and you don't need too much

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,760
you know guidance from the foundation

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,800
you're then self-organized and you're

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,000
fully running you know and you're mature

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,839
which is great um and then at the end of

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,960
a project life cycle we have our

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,720
archive projects which um are useful

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,720
projects that still exist

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,839
but maybe it's you know reached the end

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,760
of you know

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,960
the development phases that it can go

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,520
through and so

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,520
it remains within the foundation so

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,359
people can still use it but it's not

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,119
actively being contributed to

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,480
you know it's kind of reach peak

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,960
maturity

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,599
and so this is how a project team

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,320
actually

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,280
evolves through the finnos project life

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,079
cycle

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,800
and so not only are we helping um teams

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,040
with

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,160
you know maturing in terms of technology

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,240
but we're also

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,160
teaching teams how to you know mature

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,000
their projects in terms of life cycle

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,599
and maturity and growth as

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,599
well okay and so

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,720
looking at the time um i think that

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,839
we've run over

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,760
by um a few minutes but before we go

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,359
um something that i want to announce are
