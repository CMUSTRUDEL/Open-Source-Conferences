um nizzi is going to be presenting on

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
why your

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
open source program office needs to

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,360
invest in more than compliance

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,559
uh and with that i will turn it over to

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
netia and see if you

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,640
have uh any a more expansive

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
introduction you'd like to give feel

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,800
um it's really good to be here i will

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,320

it's and please feel free to ask

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,039
questions along the way

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
we are a small enough group where it can

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,040
be interactive

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:13,840
and please feel free to ask questions

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,840
i'm going to bring up the presentation

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,200
okay can you all see the presentation

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,240
we can okay wonderful um

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,960
i i wanted to address the the notion of

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,280
why your ospo or the open source program

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,439
office needs to invest in more than

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,920
compliance and um i will also talk about

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,119
open source program offices in general

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
and what they are

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
and what their functions are uh why it's

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,040
useful to have one

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,119
how companies uh begin the journey

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,799
of open source and you know start

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,399
investing in an open source program

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,360
office

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,079
so just to introduce myself um aaron

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
mentioned

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,119
two of the roles that i play today i uh

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
head the open source program office for

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
comcast

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,479
i joined comcast about three and a half

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,200
years ago when the company

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,200
uh felt that it had reached a maturity

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
point in open source where

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
it needed to invest in a full-time

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
center of excellence around

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
open source i'll talk more about my open

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
source program office

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
and i've been working with the linux

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,239
foundation for many many many years

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,680
and about four years ago i got to

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,680
join the board of directors as um

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
director at large which means i

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
represent the community and not my

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
company

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,440
and last year i was elected chair uh

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,239
it's been a fantastic opportunity to

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
really

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,920
work on the community

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
aspects of linux foundation and continue

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
to support

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,480
the success that they have bringing

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
commercial companies

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,280
and open source communities together

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,280
i've spent a lot of time also using

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,239
my platform to work on diversity issues

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,239
tech women in particular but really

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,280
creating more inclusive leadership

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,480
more inclusive companies both at comcast

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,040
as well as in the open source community

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,599
and then working backwards to the left

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
um

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
i used to run the open source program

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,799
office at western digital

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
sandisk which is a storage company flash

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,840
storage company

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
that was one of the first times i ran an

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,239
open source program office

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
and really convinced my company to start

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,000
one

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
and before that i was at wind river

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
systems which

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,440
is an embedded open source and

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,159
proprietary software company and

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,959
ran the product line for the linux

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,280
embedded linux product line

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,360
and before that it was tripwire a

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,080
security software company

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
where i helped open source tripwire for

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,200
linux

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,799
and my journey in open source really

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,519
began with silicon graphics in 1998

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,840
silicon graphics was a server company

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,840
which

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,759
decided that it was seeing the

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,759
lighting on writing on the wall that

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,479
companies were really moving to open

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,440
source

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,280
on standards-based servers and i was

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,440
part of the strategy team at silicon

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,919
graphics to move us to open source

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
moving to open source is definitely a

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,759
journey

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
you have to start somewhere and

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
sometimes you

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,880
get off the road and decide that you

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,680
just want to stay there

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
that's perfectly good for you as a

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
company

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,840
and for your business uh and sometimes

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
you just continue moving forward and you

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,520
can continue to

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
stay on this journey i don't think it

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,639
ever ends because

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
there's more to do all the time

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,600
the first stage of the journey i feel is

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,440
going from

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,240
being dependent upon vendors

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,600
and using almost exclusively proprietary

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
software

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
to moving to starting to consume open

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,160
source

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,720
and i find that this

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
was the case with comcast you know we

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,039
were

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,160
mainly operating vendor products that we

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,720
purchased

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,360
and we would just stand them up we would

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
be highly reliant on vendors

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
we would provide them our road maps we

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,479
would provide them our requirements

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,639
and have to wait in line for whenever

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
they decided to work on it

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
and there was a tremendous amount of

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,759
commercial license spent as well

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,120
and you feel that you're really not

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,800
uh in charge of your own innovation your

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
you know dependent upon whatever

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,000
standard products and

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,000
features vendors provide and i'm not

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
saying that most companies will move to

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
a hundred percent open source

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,039
framework but you find that

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,520
open source starts coming into the

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,639
company in vendor solutions

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,280
i will stake my claim that

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
most vendor solutions have some form of

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
open source

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,759
in them because a lot of key components

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,520
frameworks libraries etc are very mature

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
and good in open source especially in

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
infrastructure

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
and then you start finding that your

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,080
developers are downloading open source

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,000
and open source is getting more mature

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,479
and more and more the stack grows

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
till you know best in class companies

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,840
are using 50 60 70

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,599
open source in their infrastructure and

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,639
in their product stacks

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,479
first you know the hook often is it

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,160
looks very attractive from a cost

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
savings perspective you don't have to

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,280
pay

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
commercial fees but there is a cost of

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
ownership involved

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,560
in running open source while you don't

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,680
pay license fees

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,680
you still have to provide your own

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
support you have to

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,360
make sure that you're investing in

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,599
community relations working with the

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,599
open source community etc

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,160
so you find that one this is one of the

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,080
first steps that happens you go from

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
being a hundred percent dependent upon

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,919
vendors to start

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,720
doing your own software development

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,800
using open source

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
and it helps companies speed their

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,560
innovation process

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,720
i will say that's one of the biggest

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,240
drivers for us as a company

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,199
to start using open source and frankly

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
all of our competitors use open source

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
and if we don't

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
we fall behind it's table stakes you

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
know

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,879
in order to stay competitive to stay

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
relevant

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,400
to digitize the company to move our

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,919
digital

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,360
uh journey we do need to start using

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,039
open source

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
in in our product lines

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,680
the second step that happens is

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,560
when you start consuming you clearly

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,599
have to start doing compliance right

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,680
because open source while it's free

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,520
it's free to those who comply with the

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
license requirements

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
so your legal teams start getting

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,680
involved

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
they want to help you come up with the

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
proper usage of open source in your

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
stacks

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
they want to make sure that you're not

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,000
linking it incorrectly with company ip

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,479
and thereby compromising company ip

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,440
usually there's an emergence of

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,040
guidelines

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,440
around licenses the company

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
will make certain guidelines around

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
these are

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
okay to use these licenses are not okay

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
to use

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
and we have a pretty good guideline as

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,880
well

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,279
we have guidelines for if you're

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,760
shipping a device to customers what kind

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,640
of licenses do we allow you to use

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
if it's going to just be backend and in

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,160
the cloud

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
what kinds of licenses do we allow you

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,720
to use

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,360
and and frankly if you're consuming

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,000
something

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,920
from the open source i would highly

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
recommend that you're also checking to

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,040
see

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
that that particular project has a

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,399
healthy community

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
behind it that there's a cadence of

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,720
releases that there are

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
multiple people involved in contributing

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,360
to the project

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,240
and releasing the code that they do

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,760
testing that they have coding principles

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
that they have

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,360
a contribution guide because you don't

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,519
want

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,279
some project that you're depending upon

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
to suddenly go away

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
because there was only one person that

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
was maintaining it

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,440
so community health is something we

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,399
recommend to our teams to

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
check on before they consume uh a

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,440
software

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,720
and you'll find that there are a lot of

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,720
sites which

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,040
give you information on community health

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,120
it it looks at

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,519
release cadence the number of stars the

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,839
number of contributors involved

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
the diversity of contributors because

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
you don't want

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
all contributors to come from one single

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
company

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,240
and then that company decides to move

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
away from that project and boom the

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,959
project kind of

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,600
uh goes away we also

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
want to get our engineers into the habit

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
of

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
tracking where they downloaded the

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
source from

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,959
what the open source license is what the

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,399
text

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,640
the open source licenses etc because

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,760
in the end when you start distributing

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
these projects you

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,120
need to create a disclosure document for

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,160
it

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,160
also for security patching purposes etc

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
you want to make sure you know where you

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,959
got it from

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,160
what the copyright the license is

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,800
and so you find that consumption always

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,000
leads to compliance

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,720
you you have to invest in your legal

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
team

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,399
becoming a much more savvy about open

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
source

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,959
and engineering encouraged

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,920
to track and to work with legal

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
on compliance this is also a stage you

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
find

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,959
that one or two developers in the

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,440
engineering organization become

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,320
part-time open source program office

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
type of people

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,200
they act as kind of the liaison between

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,800
engineering and legal or

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,519
they start kind of you know being an

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,959
expert

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,360
in guidelines and in open source usage

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,560
and they become kind of the go-to people

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,320
for uh questions

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,200
i really think most of us have very good

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
intentions

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,240
and we work hard to do compliance

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,760
because it's the right thing to do it

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
respects open source

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,680
norms it respects the license that's a

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,320
small thing to do

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,600
for the right to use it it also helps us

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,040
manage risk

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,959
um risk of non-compliance can result

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,320
in everything from community enforcement

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,760
to um you know litigation

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,880
to public relations um

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,639
just the reputation of the company not

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,480
being very good to also stop ship of

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
products and hence

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,839
it's important to do compliance it's a

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,560
must do

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,560
if you are using open source in any way

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,680
so the the step that comes

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,320
after compliance is the difficult step

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
right

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,399
and is where a lot of people stop

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,160
and they say this is sufficient i'm

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,639
getting the benefit of open source

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,079
because i'm innovating quickly i have

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
open source

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,839
and it's free and i'm doing my

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
compliance you know i

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
don't need to contribute because oh my

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,959
gosh it's complex

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,200
and i don't know community norms i don't

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,519
know how to contribute

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:17,040
and what if i inadvertently contribute

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,959
ip or things that i should be patenting

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,959
or keeping inside the company

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
so this contribution becomes a real

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,240
stumbling block

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
for many many companies and it takes a

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,120
while before companies

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,000
make that transition between consumption

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,720
compliance to contribution

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,160
but you find that if you are becoming

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,920
more and more

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,320
of a user of open source it behooves you

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
to track your dependencies it behooves

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
you to know

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,880
where your software is coming from what

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,079
the quality of that software is

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
and that dependency also then says to

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
you

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,040
i am becoming very dependent upon this

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,079
particular code of software

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,880
i better contribute or engage

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,600
with that community so i know where it's

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
going

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,800
and i can work with that community to

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,800
make sure that it doesn't go

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
to a completely different direction than

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,480
where we needed to go

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,560
because our product depends upon it

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,120
going a certain way

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,199
you also start seeing that teams once

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,760
they download they may make tweaks they

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,639
may fix

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,120
bugs they may say i need to change this

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,839
to work for what we're doing

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
and if you keep carrying these custom

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,199
tweaks forward

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,720
or you fork the distribution and create

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,959
your own custom distribution

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,240
you find that you start accumulating

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,480
technical debt

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,800
and it becomes more and more and more

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,959
expensive to reconcile

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,880
the main line of the project where all

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,639
the innovations are happening that you

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,760
want to take advantage of

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,160
and your custom fork so it becomes

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,240
important to start contributing back

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,120
in order to reduce the cost of

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,399
maintenance the cost of technical debt

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,199
and to make sure that the changes that

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,760
you want

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,680
are maintained in the main line by the

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
whole community and you're not bearing

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
the burden of

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,279
all of the the forks and the changes

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,600
that you made

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,480
you also start realizing that if you are

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,199
so dependent upon this particular

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
component say you are dependent upon

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,480
kubernetes

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,120
or say the yocto project like we are

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,040
you find that you need to sit at the

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,720
table of the project whether it's at the

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,759
advisory board or the technical

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,720
committee

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,680
to make sure that your needs are being

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,360
met

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
and that your needs are being

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,720
prioritized

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,720
and it is it is um it is across

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
a number of different companies and

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,519
different

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,040
community members but you need to be at

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,759
the table to articulate

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
why the project should support what you

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,720
need

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
or why it should go in a certain way and

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
that's community engagement

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
so it can come in many many different

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,160
forms it can

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,079
come in the form of money you can say i

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,360
want to sponsor this project or i want

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,639
to give them

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,959
some money so that they don't go away

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,000
you want to give code back you want to

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
provide time

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,079
like i sit on the advisory board for the

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,199
octo project

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,800
and i evangelize the project

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,560
and make sure that the project is

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,360
successful

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,000
all of this is important because we are

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,880
all dependent upon this commons this

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,680
open source commons and if we don't give

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
back

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,920
then one day it could go away

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,680
and you know if each of us says hey

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,360
someone else will do it someone else

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,040
will take care of it

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,240
it just doesn't happen and so you end up

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,959
with something that your stack is built

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
on

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,639
one day going away so it's important for

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,160
us to sustain

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,360
open source and i think the value from

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,400
open source comes and increases

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,760
tremendously with contribution

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,559
because you are now

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,360
understanding the direction of that

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,559
particular

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,720
project you are making sure

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,640
that the project is going in the

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
direction that you want

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,799
the maintenance of your changes are back

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,400
in the project and you're not

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,720
bearing the burden you're sharing it

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,600
with everybody else

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
you're also getting frankly a technical

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
brand

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,799
uh glow from it a positive branding

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,919
a positive standing as a citizen in the

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,559
community

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,960
which then has a lot of positive ripple

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,120
effects as well

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,320
and really successive open source

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,200
depends upon

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,559
all of us not just consuming but

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,280
contributing back

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
to open source and it's one of the

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,120
things that

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
i highly recommend that we do

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,840
and and contribution will also trigger

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,799
some other legal processes in the

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,039
company

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,880
where you set up an open source advisory

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,919
council like we have

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,640
which consists of people from the patent

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,679
side

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,559
from the contract side engineering open

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
source

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,120
security and we actually

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,360
ask all of our engineers to submit a

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,880
request for contribution

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,000
and we examine each contribution across

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,960
multi-functions as i mentioned and we

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,720
then recommend that it be contributed

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,480
back

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,640
and 95 of everything that comes in front

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,520
of the open source advisory council

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,799
typically gets approved and typically

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,799
gets contributed back

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,440
the next step after you contribute

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
say bug fixes or new features to

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,039
existing projects that

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,960
that are in the open source you start

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,120
realizing that

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,600
there's code that you've created for

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,880
your own use inside the company

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,480
that may make a lot of sense to

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,720
contribute to open source and

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
you know the the inclination sometimes

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,880
is to say no

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,160
we should keep everything inside but not

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,360
everything is

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,039
ip not everything is patentable not

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,559
everything is novel

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,039
not everything is something that

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,120
is a differentiator or something you

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,679
should keep inside the company

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,960
we keep some things inside the company

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,120
which are very unique

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,520
and differentiate our customer

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,960
experience with everybody else's

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,799
however if it's if it's you know

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,760
common infrastructure stuff we typically

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,000
release it to the open source there's

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,799
also other strategic advantages to

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
releasing

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,559
things that you've created for example

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,799
you may want what you've created to

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,640
become the standard in the industry for

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,039
how something is done

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
and open source creates de facto

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,000
standards

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,640
so by releasing it and by

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,440
having the whole community use it it

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,880
starts becoming the standard way

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,679
by which some problem is solved

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
for example uh kubernetes is such a

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,840
poster child

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,919
for standardization um it is

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:40,080
how cloud native apps

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,799
get deployed in containers and

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,799
google released it many years ago i

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,000
think more than five years ago

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,720
and it's become standard everybody uses

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,240
it if you are working in cloud native

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,840
it's become a part of

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,039
amazon's services azure and google

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,840
of course so it starts becoming

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,120
the way things are done you can also

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,039
build ecosystems

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,159
when you release your project you can

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,520
have your customers partners

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,640
your vendors and others using uh

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,520
the way you want something to work right

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,520
and and to build also other extensions

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,600
and components to it

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,559
you could commoditize a space if there's

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,559
a space that's

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,120
dominated by um a commercial software

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,320
that you feel is creating an undue

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
advantage

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,640
by releasing some competitive open

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
source projects

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,919
you could start providing real

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
competition

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,039
uh to that project to that commercial

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,760
software

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,480
and thereby both accelerating its

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,000
innovation

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,840
you know of the commercial software but

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,120
also having options

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,760
and providing options to the community

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,159
and you're sharing also your experience

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,880
uh

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
with others especially in areas where

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,799
it's

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,919
not a differentiator it's not a

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,840
you know an ip or a trade secret for the

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,720
company

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,799
i think the true strategic value of open

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,400
source comes when you start becoming

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,440
very smart at when to release your own

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,799
projects

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,679
and leading companies do this

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,840
google has done this extensively even

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,919
microsoft is doing it

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,120
we've released a number of projects even

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,799
projects that

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,919
are key to our industry

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,159
for example the set-top box

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,559
is built on an open source stack and

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,760
we've released it to a consortia

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,440
of cable companies so that every cable

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
company can use it

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,159
to create their own setup box and our

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,480
differentiation comes at the top

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,960
where we add our own you know

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,559
proprietary or value-added ui

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,039
and things of that nature and you also

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,880
find

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,440
that the content distribution network

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,360
which is used by us to distribute

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,240
content across

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,320
the us is something that we've open

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,760
sourced completely and it's the apache

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,280
software foundation

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
and it's called the apache traffic

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,720
control and we felt that

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,280
um it allows us to both standardize

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,480
on a certain way of doing things but

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,320
also shares the burden of maintaining

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,000
that software with lots of other

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
companies who both use it

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,200
and contribute to it there's a great

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,400
example

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,480
that netflix gives of how when they

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
first started doing a project

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,880
they were the sole maintainers of the

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,000
project and in a few years

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,480
they became a small maintainer and the

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,760
burden was shared by so many others who

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,880
were using it

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,760
so that could be a great leverage point

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,000
also for

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,400
why you would release uh your own

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
project

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,200
the the really final stage or kind of

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,120
the leadership stage and

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,480
and there's so much to do even past this

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,120
is you can start collaborating

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,520
both inside and outside the company in a

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,559
more

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,159
intentional more strategic more

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,039
effective way

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
and the open source program office is

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,720
often

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,760
set up to do this uh because there's a

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,880
central

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,400
um if you will uh you know

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,600
uh center of excellence whose whole job

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,200
is to help the company

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:40,559
navigate open source to understand

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,760
you know foundations projects trends in

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,840
open source

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,200
uh how to work with these various trends

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,440
how to

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,039
use open source at scale how to make

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,000
sure that

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,960
all of the entities inside the company

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,159
are

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,039
competent and know how to use it

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,840
and contributions are you know more

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,960
intentional

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,000
more driven more organized there's more

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
thought behind

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,360
how you engage with communities how you

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,039
show up

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,480
at conferences uh your branding

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,279
your recruitment of people

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,200
one of the things we also find a lot of

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,400
new developers say

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,880
is that they want to work in a company

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,120
that has an open source program that

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,960
helps them contribute to open source

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,240
and that allows them to contribute to

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,000
open source

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,799
and uh frankly um comcast

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,120
if if you if you didn't know we do a

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,840
tremendous amount of technology

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,880
you would think you know why would i

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,159
want to join

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,080
comcast as a developer but

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,559
our open source branding has really

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
helped us attract some great developers

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,760
into the company

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,000
because they see that we are a technical

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,000
company and we do a lot of open source

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,880
so i think there's so much value to be

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,320
had from

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,919
open source not just from consumption

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,520
but from engagement from collaboration

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,400
from contribution and so an open source

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
program office

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,760
helps you be more intentional about

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,240
getting the best value from open source

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,240
and a lot of leading companies do this

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,480
i just wanted to stop and see if there

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,600
were any questions

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,600
and before i moved into the next few

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
slides

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,200
okay um

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,559
these slides these next few slides come

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,480
from

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,919
a group called the to do group uh todo

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,200
group talk openly develop openly

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,880
i think is is uh how it came about

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,159
and this is a group of open source

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,640
program office leaders like myself

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,240
so there are hundreds of companies who

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,480
have open source program office

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:18,240
i would say about 200 250 companies

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,559
we all get together at the to do group

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,279
to exchange best practices to work

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,480
together

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,039
on continuing to evolve you know how to

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,320
do

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,039
how open source program offices function

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,640
and you find in this slide and this may

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,520
be relevant to all of you

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,679
and what you're doing is that more and

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,520
more companies are adopting

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
the practice of having an open source

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,080
program office

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,960
clearly technology companies software

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,919
companies

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,240
like vmware or microsoft have open

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,520
source program offices

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,799
in telecoms like us but what's really

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,679
interesting is

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,720
retail companies like target and office

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,039
depot

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
as they become more digital as they

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,320
become

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,520
more virtual and if you will

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,919
doing more e-commerce and digitizing

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,559
you know their venues to market

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,520
they're becoming definitely very open

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,279
source savvy

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,159
and establishing open source program

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,640
offices what was fantastic to see

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,279
is financial services from 2019 to 2020

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,640
it's almost

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
doubled the amount of open source

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,600
program offices

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,520
such as capital one such as uh you know

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,760
bloomberg etc having open source offices

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,880
even the government is establishing open

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,399
source offices

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,559
universities governments and healthcare

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,159
especially with what's happening with

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,000
kobit

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,720
there are there's a lot of interest in

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,799
collaborating on common

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
healthcare projects whether it's contact

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,679
racing or

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,240
a data analysis around covid

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,039
spread and the to do group is a

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,799
fantastic

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:11,279
location to do group.org for

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,360
case studies information on how to start

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,080
your open source program office

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,399
it's it's a project under the linux

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,480
foundation it's free to join if you're a

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,960
member of the linux foundation

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,640
and we do this annual survey which gives

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,080
you lots of great information

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,120
on how open source program offices

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,399
are adopted where they're adopted what

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,640
value they provide

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,360
so it's really a good way to create a

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,960
business case inside your company

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,840
if you want to start an open source

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,840
program office

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,760
where does the open source program

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
office sit and what it's

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,640
what is its value to a company you find

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,279
that most of the time

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,480
they sit inside software engineering and

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,320
development

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,039
reporting into the head of engineering

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,000
for example at western digital sandisk i

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,640
reported into the svp of engineering

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,799
and here at comcast i report into the

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,440
cto office

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,640
my boss is the chief software architect

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,760
for the company

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,399
and then he works for the cto

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,200
the cto actually has two hats that he

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,960
wears

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,399
he has the product engineering

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,760
organization and he also has the cto hat

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,559
so it's actually a great place to sit

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,240
because i can work very very closely as

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,960
a developer advocate

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,559
with all of the engineering teams to

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,120
make sure that they are using open

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,240
source correctly

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,399
and you find that most

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,200
open source program offices can range

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,159
you know as you can see here

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,279
what was pleasantly surprising to me is

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,919
that 32

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,120
of officers have at least 10 employees

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,000
these are really big

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,679
big companies like google who have a lot

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,720
of people in their open source program

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,000
office

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,080
my team is six people strong and

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,600
we support thousands of developers

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,799
across comcast

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,679
we also provide support to our

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,120
m a organization to our ventures

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,760
organization

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,080
and other parts other entities in

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,360
comcast such as nbc universal or

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,360
dreamworks or sky

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,640
and you find that the longer that the

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,240
company has

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,039
established an open source program

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
office the more valuable that program

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,840
office is

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,360
which makes sense because they are

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,320
discovering new and more important ways

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,159
that the program office can coordinate

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,840
and create strategic value to the

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,679
company and business value to the

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,799
company

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,320
we have been in practice for about four

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,519
years

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,039
and i find that

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,720
this a real recognition in our chief

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,880
product officer

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,919
and our president of engineering

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,120
president of the whole

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,440
technical product group under cable

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,200
for what open source does and i get a

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,720
tremendous amount of support and

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,120
recognition

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
from our leadership which i think really

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,600
bodes to

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,600
the positive impact of open source

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,440
um and and this this is probably not a

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,080
surprise to you all

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
but we have moved from being just a

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,720
cable company

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,200
and very vendor dependent to being

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,559
a technology and media company

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,159
technology fuels

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,519
everything we do from how we distribute

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,120
content to how we create content

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,559
to the internet services we provide

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,440
to the apps to how customers interact

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,799
with

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,240
us our customer support there's a

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,440
tremendous recognition

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,480
for ai machine learning

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,960
voice activated

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,880
the use of clouds you know all of the

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,880
things that you would think

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,960
a digital company and a world-class

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,279
digital company needs to have

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,880
we've moved to creating our own platform

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,480
and apps

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,120
we lean heavily into open source and

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,080
we are obsessed with customer experience

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,919
as are all of you i know

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,039
you have to and covid has accelerated

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,279
our journey even further so it's allowed

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,720
us to kind of really really focus on

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,679
how do we create the best experience to

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,679
customers

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,320
and not have to have physical truck

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,519
rolls or calling into

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,840
the help center for help but to

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,480
enable our customers to be more and more

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,480
self-sufficient

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,840
and you you're all now familiar with

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,360
this journey

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,240
um it was about 2006 we were but before

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,360
2006 we were very very dependent

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,359
and we moved um started consuming

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,240
open source between 2006 and 2011

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,639
we established our open source policy

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,960
and

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,800
started kind of creating a rough open

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,040
source compliance

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,399
council rather advisory council for

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
contributions

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,919
my boss was one of the first ones who

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,919
contributed to apache https

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,960
in this time frame and soon by 2014 we

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,839
had been doing a lot of contributions

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,639
the number that i'm tracking from 2013

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,200
is about 13 or 14 contributions

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,200
we were also doing things like major

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,320
contributions like the apache traffic

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,159
control

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:51,440
or the set-top box and um

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,960
around the 2017 time frame is when i

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,520
joined comcast

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,359
and we started recognizing that we

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,599
wanted to be a good citizen

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,680
in the open source community we joined

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,040
the linux foundation the apache

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,160
foundation

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,440
we started um you know having an

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,680
external presence around open source

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,119
collaborating across the company which

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,800
is often called

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,359
inner source where teams across the

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
company

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,359
reuse products and projects inside the

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
company

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,920
and share code and contribute to code

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,040
across the company

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,240
breaking down silos so we

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,320
we think we are in in a

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,320
pretty decent shape we have we have more

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,800
to do clearly

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,240
but we are in a very good position from

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,800
an open source program office

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,800
perspective

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,560
um i think many of you probably have

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,480
some form of part-time open source

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,880
program office right

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,920
you know some engineers who act as the

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,160
experts

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,800
but legal is definitely involved in the

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,839
first few stages and then

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,960
as you reach critical mass and

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,560
as you realize that you need to be more

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,240
involved in open source you start

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,640
establishing an open source program

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,640
office

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,400
and as we discussed before the business

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,040
value really

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
uh increases with greater and greater

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,240
engagement

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,119
um you know how to extract the right

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,560
level of value and give back um the

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,079
right level of support

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,079
to the open source community

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,800
why start why we started for us it was

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,760
about scale

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,320
we have thousands of developers almost

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,240
between

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,960
six and nine thousand um technical folks

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,760
in the company we wanted them to be

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,560
competent

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,560
in using open source working with open

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,079
source communities

00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:00,000
it was strategic to us for innovation

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,880
um we wanted to comply uh accurately and

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,839
well

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,480
uh we wanted to improve our technical

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,520
brand

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,640
from a recruitment perspective from just

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,400
just a brand perspective

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,160
and we wanted to create a culture of

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,480
collaboration inside the company those

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,000
were some of the reasons why we started

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,000
an open source program office

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,119
and i provide

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,160
this diagram to people i know

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,760
i i always talk about my function

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,520
as six-fold uh communicate inside and

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,079
outside the company

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:43,200
guide consumption uh guide contribution

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,240
encourage collaboration and create a

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,040
culture

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,000
of collaboration and comply with

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,960
licenses

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,599
those those are really the main main

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,640
charters

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,400
of the open source program office

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,760
and it's so important to have an

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,240
external

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,040
portal or some sort of a presence and

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,359
you find that

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,320
all the best income class companies have

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,599
this

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,800
um it allows the community to

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,800
connect with you for example we get

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,839
often many questions through this portal

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,280
also frankly from a compliance

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,560
perspective you want to present

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,680
an ambulance men or a face to the

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,640
community

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,240
so that if you're not complying or if

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,079
there is an issue

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,000
they have an easy way to connect with

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,920
you and give you a chance to correct

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,200
the issue before it becomes a big issue

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,040
so here in this portal we host

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,160
all of the projects that we have open

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,280
sourced we also have our statement about

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,280
why we are involved in open source we do

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,880
innovation grants we actually do

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,359
contributions so we

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,040
have a portal for people to apply for a

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,160
grant

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,240
all our talks are featured here and also

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,560
how to contact the open source program

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
office

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,160
some of the metrics we use to measure

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,560
the success of the

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,000
office and also open source in the

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,960
company

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,040
i want to measure the open source

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,359
program office effectiveness

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,359
how are people adopting some of the

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,280
practices we've rolled out

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,119
how mature are the different divisions

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,440
in the company

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,440
what business impact are we making and i

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
have to say business impact is harder to

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
measure

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,440
because the line of sight between open

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,880
source

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,760
and the actual you know top line or

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,200
bottom line

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,480
is is hard it's it's a long line we also

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,359
want to measure

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,079
um what are we dependent upon which

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,720
communities should we work with

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,880
how are we influencing that community or

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,760
do we have sufficient number of people

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,680
involved in those communities project

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,560
effectiveness if we are open sourcing

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,280
something how healthy is our project are

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,359
we

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,200
making sure we have a maintainer and

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,920
that we have a readme document

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,480
and a contribution guide do we have a

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,720
diversity of contributor to our project

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,119
or is it comcast heavy

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,440
uh from a talent recruitment perspective

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,119
is open source one of the reasons why

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,160
people are coming in

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,720
and even in the technical ladder is it

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,599
helping

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,000
influence promotions for people are

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,599
people

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,680
saying um you know is the ladder for

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,720
becoming a distinguished engineer and a

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,359
fellow

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,280
include the fact that they need to be

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,319
involved in open source or they're

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,839
contributing

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:43,119
or they sit on a board

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,800
in open source etc and i i like to

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,359
measure the engagement as well

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,880
are we attending events are we blogging

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,599
are we sponsoring

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,480
what is the perception of the company in

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,280
open source

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,240
the to do group survey for example will

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,640
say

00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,760
here is what developers think of these

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,800
companies

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,839
and i look at that to see how

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,839
we are perceived in the community

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,720
so as i as i can as you can imagine

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,760
um open source in in comcast

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,359
is a key key part of our innovation it's

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,960
important to

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:26,960
how we innovate to get to market faster

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,960
and to do things smarter

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,680
and that's my presentation so i'm going

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,440
to stop

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:39,520
sharing and go to questions

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,520
and see if there's any questions

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:49,280
remember to unmute yourselves if you

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:51,680
have a question

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,359
uh there's one in the chat and i'll read

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,640
it out loud

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,720
what are your best tips for an

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,160
organization to get their engineers more

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,760
involved in open source

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,200
specifically for a company that

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,440
currently has no

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,359
or very little open source exposure for

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,920
employees

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,560
that's a great question one of the

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,839
things

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,200
we've done is we hold an open source day

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,359
every year and we do more than one open

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,400
source day and we invite external

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,160
speakers

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,160
we also ask uh there always are a few

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,640
enthusiasts in the company

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,319
and we highlight them we showcase them

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,800
we do a case study around

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,920
uh some some of the successes we've had

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
in the company

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,680
and that i find really fuels the rest of

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,560
the company

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,640
to get more involved and they get some

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,599
really bright ideas from

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,119
external speakers uh the speaker one is

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,720
is huge

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,160
um the second i would say

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,960
is working with hr and working with

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,920
uh the technical ladder to make sure

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,280
that open source

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,400
is a part of the requirement for to

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,440
move up the technical ladder

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,480
and then really publicizing conferences

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,160
to attend i find that when people have

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,800
attended their first open source

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,280
conference

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,480
with an apache or a linux foundation

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,560
conference

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,800
they become enthusiastic about open

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,000
source they kind of start getting

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,640
understanding the culture of open source

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,640
so those would be two or three ideas for

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,359
and and it's always easy to work first

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,000
with those who are already converted

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,720
those who are already enthusiastic and

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,640
then

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:44,800
um you know to expand from there

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,839
i have a question tia you mentioned that

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,359
um moving from sort of compliance to

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,000
contribution uh tends to be a a bit of a

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,560
hurdle

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,440
for a lot of companies and i'm wondering

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,000
if there are

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,880
uh if you have suggestions for

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:06,720
overcoming that hurdle

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:09,040
yeah um and a lot of it is because

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,319
there is no established process in the

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,520
company

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,560
so those who have made that change um

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,000
to uh an open source project

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,960
uh find it daunting to go track down

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,720
the right legal people get permission

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,079
from their bosses

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,720
and make the case for contributing it to

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,800
open source so the first one who does it

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,000
always has such a challenging time

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,599
building uh

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,040
the structures if you will and the

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,040
process if you will

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,520
and then sometimes you have to convince

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:45,359
uh it's very daunting for an engineer

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,079
to go in front of a big legal panel

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,160
of patent attorneys and contract

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,280
attorneys and say

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,079
i want to i want to give this away and

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,760
you know they're hit with why why aren't

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,920
you submitting a patent you know

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
why is this uh supposed to be inside the

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,800
company

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,880
so one of the things um

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,240
that my boss did when he first started

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,359
it and and when

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,800
comcast went from usage to this is he

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,760
started socializing it

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,640
you know one-on-one with the patent team

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,480
uh with the

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,119
contracts team and convince them

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,520
that look this is not anything

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,520
proprietary this is just a change to an

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,240
existing project that i need to give

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,599
back

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,880
and that if i don't give back i will

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,200
be holding this forever and i will never

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,440
be able to kind of continue to use

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,720
the latest and greatest of that project

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,760
so he

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,040
did a lot of groundwork to kind of

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,319
change the minds of our patent team and

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,119
our contract team so the first few times

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,160
it's it's

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,839
difficult i also one of the other things

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,520
we've been doing

00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:03,119
is making sure our legal team

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,160
is connected to the legal

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,000
network inside com inside the linux

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,680
foundation for example

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,880
and inside um there's so many other

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,560
wonderful legal frameworks legal open

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,119
source

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,920
communities if you will that people need

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,160
to connect with

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,280
contact me and i'm happy to give you a

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,319
list or aaron

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,960
also has a great list of legal

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,200
frameworks

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,359
because i think once your legal teams

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,440
start talking to other legal teams

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,200
and their peers in the industry they

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,400
realize that this is normal

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,880
this is the risk is low

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,000
this is the way to do it and frankly you

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,319
can easily talk

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,680
to one of our other open source

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,079
organizations

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,720
and and ask them you know how did you

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,200
set it up

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,040
and and kind of follow it there are

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,000
blueprints for doing it

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,000
um and it's pretty easy to make that

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,960
happen

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,040
thank you that's a great answer uh so we

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,480
have another question in chat

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,720
what are your recommendations for

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,359
aligning ospo objectives

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,200
uh with the company's change management

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,200
policies standards and guidelines

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,680
um could you say more about what you

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,839
mean by that

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:25,760
in terms of how do you align the two

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,800
reza the floor is yours i yeah

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,680
can you hear me yes yes thank you

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
thank you yeah uh yes um this is rosa

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,040
lavio i'm work

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,079
working with um wipro open source

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,160
practice and

00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:43,839
team one of the problems we have

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,960
is um there are lots of

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,119
steps and lots of work around change

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,319
management policies

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:56,720
and change management requirements with

00:47:52,319 --> 00:48:00,160
some of our clients so how open source

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:04,400
office program would

00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:07,680
um align itself with these change

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,960
management policies without

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:15,520
having a negative impact on what is

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,680
um ospo's objectives are

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,760
because sometimes these change

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,319
management

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,720
guidelines and policies drags you out of

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,359
your your mainstream objectives and

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,920
goals you've got in mind

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,599
so how because sometimes you find them

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,200
in contradictory with them

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,680
sometimes you find them as a barrier to

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,160
objectives you've got from uh for open

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,880
source and program office

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,680
and it's even even i find and change

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,280
even more difficult than um risk

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,280
management

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,359
uh and risk management strategies

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,800
so um i don't know if you you can have

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:02,000
any recommendations on

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,480
how we you can you can

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,520
help clients in terms of aligning these

00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,319
two

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,359
because we talk we talk normally a lot

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,800
around risk

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:14,720
and security and compliance but

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,119
change is something which touches

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,760
compliance risk and security

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,839
uh and it is especially when it comes to

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,400
financial services

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,640
is heavily regulated and change plays a

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,200
really important role

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,160
thank you yeah that's a great question

00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,359
and and i think

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,640
your industry is a lot more

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,319
um conscious of that than than other

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,559
industries are

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,760
in in the media and technology industry

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,800
we we have some

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,760
amount of compliance and regulation but

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,839
not as much as

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,440
in the financial services industry for

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,800
right reason maybe

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:56,720
um i we we really don't

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,119
push teams to stay um

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,599
we really leave it up to the teams to do

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,880
what's right for their organizations

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,319
in terms of change um whether it's

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,400
you know moving to the latest and

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:11,920
greatest release or

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,280
making a change in the project each team

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,000
engineering knows

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,920
or product team knows what's the right

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,480
level of trade-off to do

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,200
in what they're working on what we

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,920
recommend

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,319
what we what we do is to ask the right

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,200
questions to say

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,400
you know if you do this then you will

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,480
fall behind or

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,920
if you do this you will accumulate

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,800
technical debt

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,280
and are you sure this is what you want

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,359
to do

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,400
can is there a safe way to kind of do

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,559
this trade-off

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,160
make the change so that you can get

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,280
these other benefits

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,880
so i would say we don't push them

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,160
we really support the business in its

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,200
objectives

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,920
and we just act as a counselor guide to

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,720
them

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,200
to think outside the box in terms of

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,800
other

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,520
benefits that they could get if they

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,520
made the change

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,480
thank you thank you the next question

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,480
is how did you structure your open

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
source advisory council

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,040
um and then uh what are the main

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,800
concerns about contributions

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,400
and i'll editorialize here i take that

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,000
to mean you know what should that

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,160
council be

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,880
looking at when they're considering a

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,640
particular contribution

00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,720
that's a great question um

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,640
one of the things that we were very very

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,079
conscious of when we created the open

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,280
source advisory council

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,760
was to not call it

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,079
a committee or something that's a

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,200
gatekeeper we did not want to be a

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,800
gatekeeper

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:52,240
which said yeah but we wanted to be

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,280
a council and an advisory council so we

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,880
wanted to be guard rails

00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,359
be advised to developers who are

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,400
coming in front of us we wanted to

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:07,599
reduce the intimidation factor

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,319
we wanted to remove all friction in the

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,640
advisory council process so i'm first

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,720
talking about the process itself so we

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,119
made it dead easy there's a form they

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,359
fill and then

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,440
if it's very very easy for example if

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,240
it's just a bug fix or a documentation

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,640
change

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,400
it immediately gets approved online they

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,440
don't even have to go in front of a

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,920
meeting and a ton of

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,400
projects get approved that way but if

00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,160
they're making

00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,800
really content changes or feature

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,240
changes they have to go in front of

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,440
an actually a live meeting and and

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,839
justify

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,680
the business case for why they feel that

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,960
this should be contributed outside the

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,680
company

00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:57,440
so the the composition is um we have

00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:00,480
bought three attorneys one from the

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,640
contract side one from the ip side we

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:06,079
have our strategic ip team

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,680
who really kind of manages our patent

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,839
portfolio also there

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,200
they're more business people and techno

00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:15,839
technologists

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,319
who have in their mind the kind of

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,960
patent portfolio comcast should have

00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,920
both for

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,920
defensive purposes and other purposes

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,640
and then we have

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,599
the security person and then we have two

00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,680
or three

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,920
really big technologists in the company

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,680
fellows distinguished engineers

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,040
and then we have a couple of people from

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,640
the ospo

00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,839
and the dynamics are such that

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,680
most of the questions typically come

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:47,599
from our patent attorney

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:49,680
and the question he often asks is

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,160
you know what's the functionality is

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,200
this something that you filed a patent

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,599
for

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,400
because you can still patent something

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,920
and

00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,400
choose to release it so we encourage

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,000
people

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:07,280
if it is patentable to do that and his

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,079
his thought process is typically is this

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,920
something

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:16,160
that is very close to how we do things

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,960
is this something that's uh you know um

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,839
important to our competitive advantage

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,040
is this in an

00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,839
area that could weaken adjoining patents

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,960
is this

00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,280
in an area that we want to uh keep

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,160
inside the company from a pathology

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,000
perspective

00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,280
each company has their own patent

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,200
strategy and

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:40,240
so he asks a number of questions there

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,119
and depending upon the answers

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,760
we either say yes or no and as i

00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,520
indicated

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,839
about 95 of the time we say yes

00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,880
there's only five percent of the time

00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,160
that

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,480
you know we say no and you know when you

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,079
start this process as an engineer

00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,839
you first have to get your manager's

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,480
approval which is saying

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,280
the business says this is something we

00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,760
do feel

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,680
is okay to open source and then the open

00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,000
source advisory console really is making

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,960
sure that the developer is successful

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,079
so our ospo team for example helps the

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,599
developer

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,920
put it out on github correctly

00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,160
make sure that it has it's been scrubbed

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,799
and scanned and cleaned from a security

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,200
perspective

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:27,119
and from a proprietary perspective that

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,760
it has the right branding

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,599
that it has the right copyright and cla

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,040
and so on and so forth so

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,520
um it's really um set up to

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,160
make the developer successful in doing

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,160
it correctly

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,119
thank you and the last question with a

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,160
minute left um

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,319
what recommendations do you have to stop

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,799
the branching and customization of

00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,480
open source components consumed

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,200
internally within your company

00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,119
and i guess i will add a sub question is

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,880
it desirable to prevent that

00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:05,839
or what other strategies do you have to

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,799
ensure that that is consistent with your

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,680
strategy this is one of the hardest

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,400
things to do

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,920
which is stopping people from

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,319
customizing it

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,440
and not contributing it back and so it's

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,160
a very very

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,520
good question because most of the

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,400
engineering managers

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,079
are under pressure to deliver products

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,520
and move on to the next product and the

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,839
next product so

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,920
they accumulate all these changes and

00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,160
there's never enough time to

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,280
package it and you know put it back into

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,480
open source

00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,160
so we are doing a lot of education of

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,359
middle managers and engineering

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,000
managers to say hey it's in your best

00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,280
interest to

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,960
make sure that it's um put back because

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,880
uh it's going to accumulate and it's

00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,960
going to kind of you

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,200
uh both from security patching

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,400
perspective but also from a carrying

00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,720
perspective

00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,799
and some people get it some people don't

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,599
so this is a problem that we continue to

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,760
fight

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,520
and it's a it's an issue that we

00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:09,680
continue to work on

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:12,880
um so i i don't have a good answer

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,920
i i feel that this is something that you

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,880
have to constantly be on top of

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,280
i think that's a good answer uh well

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,920
with

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,200
that our time is up uh thank you so much

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,839
for being here and sharing your

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,000
experience

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:28,000
with us as our members are maturing

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,839
their own open source program offices i

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,599
can't think of a better model for

00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:33,440
corporate open source leadership so i'm

00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,200
really grateful that you took the time

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,280
to present today

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,180
thank you so much and hope you all have

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:50,369
a great day

00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:50,369
