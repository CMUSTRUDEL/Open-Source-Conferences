00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,480
so my name is connor o'neill um i'm head

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
of product

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,159
um and jar is juris head of propositions

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,879
i'm based in

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,159
west cork in the southwest of ireland

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,840
where it's famous for

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,200
cheese and it's famous for its views um

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,040
cherry is based in dublin which is

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
famous for a lot more things than cheese

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
and views

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,799
um but uh we'll we'll get on to that

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,159
that topic of where we both are

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,000
um in a moment um

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,680
so just to tell you a little bit about

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
near form the company if you're not

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,799
familiar with us

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
it is an unusual company i mean we we

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
use that word mavericks in the title

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
and fundamentally we're a professional

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,879
services company um

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,120
and we build web apps and mobile apps

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,080
for for mostly large organizations

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
around the world

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,760
but doing that and the way we've done it

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,080
has led us into some

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
you know particularly interesting areas

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
so we're we're headquartered in a

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
tiny little place called tremor it's a

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
it's a seaside town in the

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,040
southeast of ireland uk people like a

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,799
little brighton and for the us people

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
like a little santa cruz it even has

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,040
amusements and so on

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,959
so you wouldn't expect to have sort of a

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,639
world leader in certain aspects of open

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,280
source base there but

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
it is that that's where headquarters is

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,520
but because it's there and

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
because not every top developer that you

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
want working for you wants to work in a

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,880
place like that we've been a remote

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
first company since the start we're

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,880
entirely distributed

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,199
and so if people in over 20 countries i

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
think it's 27 countries now

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,040
um and they're working in distributed

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
teams so it's not that we have a team in

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
country x and they only do projects in

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
country x any given project it brings

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,720
together

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,680
the right people at the right time and

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
the company started by 28 2011 2012 and

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,360
the founders

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
went all in on node hence the gigantic

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
note logo there on that

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,360
screen and and really for speed and

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
agility they found they were able to

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
deliver projects a lot quicker with no

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
than with any other technology

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,840
and they bet on it early so they bet on

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,440
it when it was sort of

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,479
0.40.6 and it turned out to be the right

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,400
decision which was

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,479
you know phenomenal for the company and

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,280
really helped drive its growth

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,440
but yeah on top of that kean you know

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,960
akin imagine our ceo he really does have

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,880
this deep belief in the power and

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,479
importance of contributing back to open

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,479
source it's not about just

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
consuming it and it's always believed

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,479
that and it's actually led to us

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,720
spending very serious percentages

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
of our revenue in supporting oss over

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,919
the past few years

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
um which we'll talk about more in a

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
second and

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,800
i won't spend too long talking about

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,919
these we call them other

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,600
oss projects so like we support a lot of

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,560
open source not just the node core

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
project itself

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
where we put it we have a you know over

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,039
the years we've had a huge number of

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
people

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,560
that we supported full-time in in many

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
cases uh

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
working on no but i just quickly briefly

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
talked about three we'll call them

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,880
building

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
block oss projects that we're involved

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
in clinic js is something we built from

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
scratch

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
it's there just to make no developers

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,199
lives easier it does

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,680
the types of performance analysis that

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,000
there you know other tools can't do

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,919
and and you know it's corporate or open

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,840
source but as of last week it's now got

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,919
its own github org

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,120
and it has been re-licensed from gpl to

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,280
mit really to

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
help drive the community around it and

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,120
have more people involved in it

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
http 3 isn't something you need to be

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,360
worried about today

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,800
but it is going to be a hugely impactful

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,400
piece of technology

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,319
a massive jump over http 2 and http 1.1

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
um and you know it's actually going to

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
be something you pay attention to as a

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
developer whereas you may not have with

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
you know the older ones

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
it was just what you used and we're

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
actually doing the implementation on

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
that for

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
for node and then finally worker threads

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
in node node itself

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
it addresses the biggest criticism of

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,880
node that it's single threaded

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
and that was actually conceived and

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,440
developed by uh

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
anna hemings in in your form

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
and the other thing we're heavily

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
involved in is inner source and i think

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,319
if if there's a lot of um

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
kind of people who have been on finos

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
webinars to date you know you'll know

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
denise denise is on on the line

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,080
today as well she's done some phenomenal

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,440
webinars to to

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,360
finn us on this topic and it remains a

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
really really important thing

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
for near form and actually one thing a

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
lot of many

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
people aren't aware of it really to play

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
a key role in our involvement

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
uh with the irish culvert 19 contact

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
tracing a project and

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,520
and helped drive a lot of the activity

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
there

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,160
um the phrase you know why invest so

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
much in open source we could ask that a

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
lot particularly as we're not a

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,120
we're not a huge company we're 160 ish

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
people

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
and you know so who are these kind of

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,919
crazy irish guys they're based in the

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
middle of nowhere but they're building

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,319
apps for ey

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,360
and adp in the new york times

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,039
and they're contributing more node

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,400
companies you know a thousand times

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,199
there's is so

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,720
like why do they do this stuff um and it

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,560
actually boils down to

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
uh when i was joining your former about

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,680
three and a half years ago i asked

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,160
uh kean the ceo if you want at the sense

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,599
he wanted to you know leave a mark on

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
the world and he said i want to leave a

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,440
star

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,560
on the planet and put in a good way

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,039
um and that really has driven so much of

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
what

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,840
do that that approach to yes we're a

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,280
commercial organization but we want to

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
do more than just be a commercial

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,599
organization

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
and we have absolute faith that this

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,560
idea of sustainable open source helps

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,159
everyone it helps us as a business but

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
it helps everyone we work with

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,039
and and far beyond that and it really

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,080
has enabled us to deliver like 150 plus

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,240
enterprise apps um since since we

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,120
started but really it was 2020 and it

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
was covered

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
or this combination of major contributor

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,040
to open source

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,760
remote working and the ability to

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,240
deliver incredibly quickly came together

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
in a in a you know a perfect storm kind

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
of in the opposite

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,920
sense of a perfect storm for us and to

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,080
help in this fight against covet 19.

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
um and on that i'm actually going to

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
hand you over to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,880
jar who's going to give you a little bit

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,480
of context around how we work and

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,080
the way we do things great uh thanks

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,519
connor and hi everybody

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,360
uh i've only have a few slides and the

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,839
idea is to give you just a flavor of

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,600
near form in the context

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
of what we're doing i think conor has

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
given the background i suppose and in

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,240
some ways this is a story of

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,360
an open source company growing up and

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
growing out so

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,760
really we're a full stack development

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,800
company we're lucky enough to

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,959
um work with some household names around

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,959
the world and then that's growing

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,480
um and as connor mentioned the remote

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,000
first is quite interesting in that it's

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
now become a really

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
important thing for people over the last

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,480
six months but for us it's just part of

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,920
the dna

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,720
uh i i wanted to just give a flavor of

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,600
what we do but also maybe get feedback

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
from people

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,880
we're learning and we're listening to

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
the market and it's kind of pulling us

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,680
in different directions and we're

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
um really excited about what we're doing

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
with things like accelerated development

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,560
and

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,760
um kind of applied open source at the

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,200
enterprise so i just wanted to kind of

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,279
touch on those and it might

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
raise a few questions and that's why i

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,519
guess we we see here we do

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,720
digital solutions but we also do

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,240
capability

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,640
if you uh next slide connor i think um

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
it's a pretty typical engagement arc i

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,959
guess for a solutions company

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that we are often even from one client

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,680
or one partner

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,079
we were asked originally for advice

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,880
which leads to a digital solution

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,320
um but more and more i think

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
particularly with the open source

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
background and the growth of maturity of

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,959
open source and enterprise

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,360
um we're being kind of brought in to do

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,200
more and to provide more of a platform

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,000
and that and that's becoming

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,880
quite a strong theme for us now both as

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
a company and we

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,839
feel in the market as well so the two

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,320
interesting things here i think are that

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
we've invested a lot in what we call

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,519
accelerated development over the last

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,120
few years of all of our

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
team bench time and a whole bunch of

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,079
architecture time has gone into

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
accelerated development

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,120
which will explain and that's leading us

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,320
into accelerated enterprise which um

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,000
is really i guess the application of the

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
best of open source

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
into enterprise to drive what we call

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,279
real transformation so there's been an

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
awful lot of talk about

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,120
business transformation digital

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,040
transformation a lot of it has failed

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
what we're finding is the practical

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,800
application of the best of open source

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
is actually a great way to

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,120
start delivering real impact so so those

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
are our engagement models we're

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
primarily digital solutions so as i say

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,959
we have

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
large teams in place with large

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,079
companies for years that are kind of

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,760
moving towards a more digital enterprise

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
and capability building

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,839
uh on the next slide i'll talk about uh

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,279
accelerated

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,880
development what we mean so we i think

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,360
if you looked at our philosophy

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,200
uh across the team it's an ounce of

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,200
architectures worth a pound of code so

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,839
we're very heavy on

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,959
architects technical directors assistant

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
technical directors

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,200
they're quite an opinionated bunch and

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,440
they hate to do boring repetitive work

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,519
we make a living by delivering high

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,399
quality software at speed so

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,440
what we've found is that a lot of

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,720
companies a lot of people are

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
reinventing the wheel

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
or they're struggling because of the

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
plethora of

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
new technologies new tools and new

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
processes that are out there

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
they're struggling to start the project

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,079
because of the decisions that have to be

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,880
made

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,160
so we feel and actually we're pretty

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,480
certain based on all the

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,200
uh evidence we've seen from the front

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,639
line

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,399
that the the drag of the tech choices

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
picking the two setting of the team and

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,760
setting up the environment is dragging

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,880
30 or 40 percent of your budget out of

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,720
the project

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,959
what we've done over the last few years

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
has developed what we call accelerators

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,399
um and it's more than just an approach

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,959
it's a full tech stack

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,760
it's documented tools processes i'll

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,279
give an example in a second

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,920
to kick start the project and for one of

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,920
our clients recently we we got to

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,600
working on features with the users

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,279
within about four days where it would

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,160
normally be four weeks

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
um so we feel in particular scenarios

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,480
for

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,519
whether it's uh cloud native uh or cloud

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,680
sas

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,360
uh polaris there is the one we talk

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,360
about today it's more front end it's

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,720
more mobile than web combined

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,279
it's not really on the channel it's more

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,839
multi-channel but i can give an example

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
of it

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,519
we feel that that as a tool

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,040
and an approach is brilliant for our

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
clients because they get more features

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,320
for the same budget we get started

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,160
quicker we get finished quicker

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,000
and we're also finding a lot more value

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,120
that they're they're coming up with and

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,720
that to us is of interest in this

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,560
fitness organization because it's i

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,160
think it's an approach using open source

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,560
that can benefit everybody

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,000
i'm going to talk to those i'm going to

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
show a really technical architecture

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
diagram please don't ask me questions or

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,199
i'll my ignorance will be exposed

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,720
exposed but on the next slide

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,440
you can see polaris it's an example of

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
the

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
amount of work that goes into doing

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,639
things right i guess

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,320
but if you're to pick out a couple of

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,600
points here

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,320
the way that we advocate using

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
a core of react and react native allows

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,600
you to get

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,000
apps out on ios android and web using a

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
single code base in a single team

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,839
and the way we break that down into

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,880
components is what's actually

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,079
helping us to concurrently develop eight

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,240
or nine of these big

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,440
covet apps uh in different countries at

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,839
the same time so

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
what we're finding is that that um

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,279
taking the time to get the best of open

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
source and the best architecture is

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,160
actually what's driving

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,480
um our ability to deliver at scale

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,040
so like i think conor will go into this

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,279
a little later on board we're delivering

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
a lot of apps to different countries and

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,120
different governments that are not all

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,880
the same

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
beyond the bluetooth tech but we're

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
doing it in a way that's scalable and

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,440
repeatable

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
with very little uh in the way of

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,639
regression so part of that is the

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,839
component architecture

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,760
the other thing i'd say about this is

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
this is what we think is best but if a

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
particular enterprise

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,639
doesn't want to use storybook or doesn't

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
want to use x-state that's okay they can

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,959
be swapped out

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,959
they may not want they may want to use

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,519
javascript rather than typescript so

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,160
it's not

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
a carved and stone architecture but it

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
is our

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,720
best approach in our own development

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,079
projects we use it uh working with

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,199
enterprises we swap in and out the

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,920
piston suits and

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,079
suit them the best um and it's having an

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,759
impact so if we look at the next slide

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,360
i can just give a brief flavor um

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
talk a lot about financial services but

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,519
one example i hear and i know there's a

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,320
couple people from ibm on the call so

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,519
a good shout out to them we've recently

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
uh

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,440
looked at open banking so open banking

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,920
is live and working in

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,480
uh europe and uk and probably most

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,519
certainly on the way to the us

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,320
um using the accelerated approach we

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
were able to

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
develop a working open banking app in

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
about three weeks

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
um and we can point you at the end of

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,519
the presentation to a

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
link to the full slides and full webinar

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
um it for ibm

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,720
i think it was a great example of how to

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,480
use cloud packs for us it was an example

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
of using the polaris front end

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
accelerator to

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
get a working app for interbank

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,279
transfers um

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,959
beautifully designed well run and open

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,360
on running in about three weeks

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,880
so that's an example for financial

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,560
services

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,440
but the other thing we're learning is

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,680
that it's highly scalable and i think

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,600
conor will go into this is that we're

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,120
able to produce

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
different apps around the world very

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,880
quickly and the covet example

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,600
so essentially we're building using the

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
accelerators an open source platform to

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,399
deliver services rather than separate

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,040
apps and it's working really well

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,600
lastly i just look at where that grows

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
up to

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
and what we're finding in the real world

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
now is that

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,799
addressing bigger problems for

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
enterprise is one of the themes that's

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,400
coming out for us

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,319
um there isn't a large enterprise in the

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,679
world that doesn't have some form of

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,319
front-end legacy to take one example

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,799
so the average enterprise is carrying

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,280
some

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,559
some app from marketing some map from a

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,640
failed transformation or a

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,559
transformation hangover app they call it

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
and four or five other apps that are

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,280
spread across different teams of

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,799
different technologies

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
you often these days have you're

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,600
supporting more technologies than you

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,120
are engineers

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,039
um and we're talking to cios in the uk

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,559
us and european markets now we're all

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
not in their head figures about this

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,400
that

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,520
the the front end is has got sprawl

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,640
the impact is uh slow innovation

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,320
high costs multiple teams and and a lack

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,559
of confidence about where the skills

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,679
roadmap is going to go to

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,320
so what we're doing with uh for example

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,480
polaris

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
is providing a technical transformation

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
uh path

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
uh which is going to have a much

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
stronger target front end like a digital

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,440
platform

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,120
we have one client in north america

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
right now it's doing that and

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,799
taking on polaris as their target

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,520
platform for 100

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,000
technologists for the next five years so

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
we'll be

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,280
uh publishing a case study in that soon

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,120
i'm aware of time i want to hand back to

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,200
connor very quickly and happy to take

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,000
questions at the end

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,960
thanks jared um i'll cover now what

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
we've been doing

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,320
in the past 20 odd weeks around

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
uh contact covenanting contact tracing

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,280
exposure notification

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,720
and very briefly um i'll

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,400
i'll describe uh how it works

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
um for those of you who don't know if

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
you're in countries that don't our

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,679
states in the us that don't have this

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
yet

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,880
basically when you have one of these

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
apps installed uh

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,320
google and apple run a service that

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,080
broadcasts uh

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,720
anonymous identifier bluetooth

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,919
identifiers that change every 15 minutes

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,799
uh your phone sees those it logs them

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
if you're proven to be infected the

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,760
contact tracing center will

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
ask you will you upload the keys you've

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
been broadcasting in

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,120
a particular time period and then every

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
phone gets those keys

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
and then on their phones they can go

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
oops um

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
you know i have actually been exposed to

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,120
that person for more than 15 minutes you

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,840
know and

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,919
they were within about two meters of me

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,000
all of the matching and

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,320
the the keys and all that sort of stuff

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,559
is happening locally on the phones

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,400
rather than happening on kind of at the

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,280
back end the back end only acts as a

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
conduit

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,039
for sharing those keys anonymously so

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
it's an entirely anonymous private

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
system

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,520
to enable people to know that they have

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,880
potentially been

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,559
exposed to somebody who's interacted

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
with cohort 19. so that that's it in a

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,520
nutshell

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,720
and that's how the the google apple

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,919
system works

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,160
um so we were asked um we basically got

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
a call on bank holiday weekend uh in

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,679
march from the head service executive

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,640
which is like the british nhs

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,159
uh asked us could we build um a contact

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,960
tracing app and could we do it in a

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,760
couple of weeks

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
so we said yes um and got started that

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,559
evening

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,080
using all the tech that the jar has just

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,039
been talking about in fact

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
um built it had a core prototype working

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,320
in a couple of days

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
and a map ready to release within four

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
weeks and

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,480
but it was as is known an old style

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,559
application a centralized application

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
as soon as google and apple uh released

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,400
their decentralized model the model i've

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,919
just talked about there uh

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
luckily the hsc jumped on it as did we

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,840
so we

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,440
spun it around um and again within a

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,400
couple of weeks we had

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,919
um one of the world's first um kind of

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,960
decentralized conflict racing

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,120
applications

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,080
uh it then turned out to be in terms of

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,440
launch the most successful worldwide

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,520
um where currently uh 1.7 million

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
installs have happened in ireland which

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,240
you know uh southern ireland has a

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
population of around

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,280
around four million um and has been

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,559
installed by about forty percent of

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
let's call it addressable uh p people um

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,640
in

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,559
in the south um and uh is already and

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,440
this is the important thing for the hse

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,880
is already proving its worth many times

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,960
over in terms of people

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,320
getting notifications that they've been

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
exposed and going through the whole

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,640
process to get tested

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,000
and so on so it's been a huge success

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
and it doesn't just do contact

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,679
tracing it also does symptom check-in

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,679
and information updates and so on

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,440
and we have another podcast coming on

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,720
friday go on to our website and go on to

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,720
the covet 19

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,080
uh page if you want to register for that

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,520
or we're going to map

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,600
we'll be going to massive level of

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,320
details with the actual implementers

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
of the code both on our side um and uh

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,360
from the hse

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,960
side if you haven't seen one of these

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
apps before here's just a couple of

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,440
quick screenshots to give you a sense

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,039
uh of how the irish one works uh we get

00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
a couple of hundred thousand check-ins

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,000
every day

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,240
that's a little symptom checker it again

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
only runs on your phone it's really for

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,320
you

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,080
to kind of track how you're doing and

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,679
how you're feeling um

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
and then you can see the various stats

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,559
that are happening globally in term or

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,600
in ireland in terms of cases and so on

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,880
um a couple of quick uh highlights there

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,200
and we've had we're we've been building

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,120
nine apps to date with a lot more coming

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,360
so we should be covering a population of

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,640
about 53 million people by the second

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,559
week of september

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,880
and which is which is incredible and

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,000
we're seeing an average uptake so far in

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,559
the absolutely being released

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,320
about 40 as i said very very quick

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,200
release we haven't had any security

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,200
issues yet

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
and the interoperability piece though is

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,120
particularly important

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,240
uh in an i well first of all in an irish

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,159
context because you have two

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,400
jurisdictions on the island of ireland

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,600
without a hard border between them and a

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
lot of people who live in one

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,520
jurisdiction and work in the other

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,720
and traveling every day so the irish and

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
northern irish apps

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,480
both of which we created are fully

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
interoperable in terms of sharing the

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
anonymous keys

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,280
so it doesn't matter where uh you know

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,080
exposure has happened you will get

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,080
notified

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,400
irrespective of which app you're running

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,320
um and i'll talk a little bit more about

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,919
the code and the linux foundation public

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,200
health um

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,320
in a moment and this is again just to

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,159
give you a sense of

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,919
what we've been about so the gibraltar

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,120
app which we built is very different for

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,960
example to the irish app

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,640
it only does contact tracing it

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,559
effectively has no ui

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,679
other than what you see there i have

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,919
tested positive

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,200
the northern irish app again very very

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,760
different ui

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,360
and similar functionality two big

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,640
question marks were two massive ones

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
which we'll be announcing in the next

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,760
couple of weeks

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,520
and then along the right there you'll

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,039
see pennsylvania just announced that

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,919
they'll be going live in the next few

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,679
weeks

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,720
with an app that we developed delaware

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,960
to scotland the same and all using a

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,000
very similar code base which is which is

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,559
phenomenal for us um but this is you

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
know for

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,000
to to do a story arc and i know we're

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,039
under a little bit of time brush but to

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,159
do that kind of full

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,200
story arc from you know a little company

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,679
based in a little town and jumping on

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,039
node

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,760
node.js jumping on open source um

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,159
and you know getting it right

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,440
effectively in terms of

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,840
contribution and doing all of this

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,559
and then that full arc to here we are

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
now

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,080
where um the code we wrote uh you know

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,120
relying on open source that we wrote

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,559
and that many others were involved in uh

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,799
will now be the basis for

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,159
you know a huge number of 19 apps

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,200
worldwide and when you

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,880
think about um you know the

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,720
some of the things that we have worked

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,159
on that are all being used

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,320
within this application so um you have

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,279
uh you've node so our but you know the

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,080
back end is

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,120
is using node uh front end is is

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,960
javascript we have

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,799
we contribute to the react native

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
project itself uh we're using the

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,080
fastified web framework

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,240
which is built by a near former you know

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,799
and i i could go on and on about you

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,440
know every aspect of that of that open

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,559
source

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,520
but what ended up happening then is the

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,960
the original hse app they they released

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,960
it as open source so for

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,039
some people could see how you know how

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,039
the apps were built that there was no

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,720
this was a a critical part of the

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,520
overall launch was the trust piece

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,080
but then as we then started getting

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
opportunities particularly in u.s states

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,520
it was realized that you know let's take

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,640
that code base

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,080
and donate it into the linux foundation

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
public health which is a new group

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,559
within linux foundation

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,320
focused on obviously public health and

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,559
and really make it a a

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,640
true citizen in terms of being an open

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,159
source project that many people are

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,000
are contributing to um and taking from

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
you know and building up building

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,600
solutions on top of them

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,360
and that's you know it was it was

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
incredible for us to work with the irish

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
government

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,760
to achieve this and you know big props

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,279
to denise as i said on the call who was

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,440
heavily involved in this

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,400
um and it's really particularly exciting

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,400
for us that that

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,880
you know a very traditional health

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,679
public health authority like the hsc is

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,520
similar to

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,279
many others so it's you know a

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
conservative organization

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,400
moving from we'd almost call it a

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,400
suspicion of open source

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
to embracing it you know in the original

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,919
launch for them to actually becoming

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,919
evangelists for open source and for

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
public health using open source

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,279
in the space of 20 weeks you know and if

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,679
i i think that if

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,360
if an organization like that can move

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,960
that quickly given the situation

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
situation we're in

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,240
in the world there should be nothing

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,240
stopping any conservative business

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,760
you know achieving the same thing so it

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,400
been huge for us um and and finally i

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,640
just want to talk a little bit about

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
and complexity and and i do think it's

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,799
important that

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,240
sometimes oh you open source that's you

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,840
basically you know made your github repo

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,480
knock yourself out everybody it's open

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,080
source that's not what covered green

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,840
at all there's there's a lot of moving

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,960
parts there's a lot of

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,039
organized people uh both

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,039
on the from the open source world but

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,520
also from the commercial world

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,120
involved in this and a lot of states

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
particularly us states and

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,720
you know countries involved so there's

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,559
there's a lot of

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,000
as i said there's a a lot of

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,760
stakeholders in this

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,039
and all involved in taking from

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,760
contributing to

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,080
and involved with uh having this as a

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,120
highly successful open source project

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
um and it is you know it has proven a

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,640
challenge and there's

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
absolutely you know no way it has proven

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,159
a challenge for everybody involved

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,080
in this to achieve this you know we've

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
been doing this for many many years but

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,200
most of the other people involved in

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,600
this haven't

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,720
it is it's been joyful for us to see

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,919
them um

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,559
embracing this and seeing the importance

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,559
of it

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,679
and actually you know i talked about

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,240
evangelizing

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,399
you know we have people from the hse in

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
ireland going on

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,640
with u.s states to tell them how

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,520
important all of this is

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,720
works and how you know taking this open

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,320
approach the

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
source approach this transparent

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,360
approach privacy

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
data protection all of these things

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,600
tying together in that

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,240
you know the word open it creates a

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,960
sense of trust and trust is what then

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,679
enables

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
these applications to be successful in a

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,919
world where people are

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,760
tending to be maybe a little bit um

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,159
cautious about anything to do with

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,000
applications and phones and so on

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,559
and that's really all i wanted to say on

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,159
that i'll bring you back to journal

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,159
and to do a little bit of a wrap-up

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,000
sure i think we're slightly over time

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,559
with for anyone who's still on

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,600
uh these are the kind of questions we

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,919
think we've raised

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,200
but i'm sure there are many more or uh

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,679
people may be interested

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,039
in all the aspects we have in common so

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,760
we talked a little bit about open

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,080
banking

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,279
um very briefly about front-end

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,200
technical debt which you think is the

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,080
next criteria for for pushing open

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,559
source

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
into the enterprise at a bigger level

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,279
and

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,559
uh yeah and i think conor is really sort

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,120
of well there that

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,279
it's a it's a story about open source as

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,640
much as

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,559
uh what's happened over the last few

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,440
months we also have some links here i'm

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,840
very happy to

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,679
publish or pass on any other links that

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,640
people are interested in they want more

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,919
detail

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
um on any one of the accelerators you

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,679
mentioned any one of the apps anymore

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,679
any part of the

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,880
work what you're doing or even just to

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
have a chat

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,679
very happy to do that

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,640
yeah so thank you very much um that's um

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,039
that's really awesome

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,919
um and before we actually go over to the

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,480
q a

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,200
um i'd like to announce the winners that

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,480
we have

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,960
um for the two finnos t-shirts so

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,840
i'd like to congratulate richard from

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,039
codethink

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,159
for winning the philos t-shirt um and

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,320
sam pecuna from deutsche bank um for

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,880
winning a finos t-shirt as well

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,559
um and a member of the finnos team will

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,679
get in contact with you for your address

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,840
details

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,120
um we are a little over time but i think

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,399
it'll be good to have

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,279
one question um if that's okay um

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,279
and that comes from adam jones um who

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,000
actually asked on chat earlier

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,559
are all of your open source accelerators

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,760
or

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,679
or are your accelerator stacks open

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
source that was the actual question

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,440
and joe i know that you um answered this

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,679
in the chat but it'll be great if um

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,039
you could also give the answer um

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,559
verbally so we've got it

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,760
um for everybody to to hear later on

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,679
yes and and uh yes they're using open

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,120
source and yes they are being open

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,840
sourced one by one i think that's the

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,720
answer

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,640
and so for example we originally put the

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,799
polaris banking reference app

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,080
out about three months ago and the

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,840
actual code for

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,360
polaris is is out and in the wild uh

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,640
from about a month and a half ago

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,159
i think mira for cloud native and cloud

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,760
serverless is out

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,960
and i'm pretty sure our sas cloud stuff

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,039
titus and taurus

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,399
is already out in the wild i know that

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,000
denise would say we

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,679
we've done the first few steps and now

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,039
the community is building around it but

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,679
i think they're out i'd have to check on

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,600
that and the next the others are

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,840
will come out as they are ready over the

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,760
next couple months

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,679
so that's brilliant so maybe we can um

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,279
get an update from you and put that

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,159
as a blog or you know an article on the

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,720
