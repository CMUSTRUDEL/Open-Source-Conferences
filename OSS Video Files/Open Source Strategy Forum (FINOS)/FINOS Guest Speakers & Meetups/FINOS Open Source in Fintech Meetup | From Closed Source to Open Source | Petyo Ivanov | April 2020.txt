[Music]

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:20,820
today for our virtual meet up and and

00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,859
meetups always have interesting stories

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,720
behind them whether they're the

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,250
technical part of it but but also the

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,869
story's just getting here in the first

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,620
place

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,010
Petiot Ivanov from glue 42 is going to

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,160
talk about how glue 42 has been taking a

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,539
journey from close source to open source

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,620
and I'm just gonna let pitch here go

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,870
ahead and go

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,629
we're already quarter past the hour at

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,570
you please take it over yeah thank you

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,670
very much for the introduce everyone my

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,399
name is Patty Ivanov I'm the product

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,160
manager of glue 42 and today I'm going

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,280
to talk about the journey of our company

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,799
into the open source world I will

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,229
explain the new initiative where we are

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,770
currently running it has just been

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,360
released maybe a couple of weeks ago I

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,420
will explain what's our motivation

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,180
behind it why we are starting it and

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,130
what we hope to make out of it and to

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,350
give to the people who are using it so

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,780
spoiler alert we are in the beginning of

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,180
our journey so I do hope that he knows

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,640
we'll invite this couple of months from

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,560
now so we can share an update with

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:44,070
everyone about how are we going so to

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,420
start with a short intro about what goo

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:51,540
42 is well the way I would put it we are

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,770
the textbook definition of an enterprise

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,110
software vendor really large

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,630
organizations with complex software

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,840
development life cycles are choosing

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,560
good 42 as a way for them to integrate

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,790
teahouse development software and things

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,290
which they have purchased into a single

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,750
unified user workflow

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:20,640
so for those of you who are familiar

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:26,819
with FDC 3 go 42 is one of the

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,510
supporting platforms for FDC 3 beats

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:34,799
goo 42 core and this is a new initiative

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:38,010
and comparing it with goo 42 which is of

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,170
course a commercial product with complex

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,629
licensing mechanisms and so and so on

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,480
goo 42 core is probably the exact

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:50,609
opposite that and that's a new version

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,400
of our product so we 42 core is open

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:56,269
source it's MIT licensed which means

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,590
that anybody can take the package

00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,670
install it in their environment go to

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,750
production with it

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,389
without even bothering to contactors

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,909
exactly the opposite of how you would

00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:14,010
obtain good 42 right it's we have

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:17,639
charging zone and so on now that's a

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,669
pretty sharp turn as you may understand

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,099
so let's explain what made us do that

00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,989
and by the way if you're interested in a

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,069
42 core I'm going to share some

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,870
resources by the end of this

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:33,449
presentation so what we before we move

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,049
forward I would like to present probably

00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:41,400
informal and not very complete model of

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:44,459
why companies like ours are not only

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,489
ours but companies in general are open

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,109
sourcing things either products or

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,030
internal bits and so on

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,099
I'm not going to talk about personal

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,239
open-source projects because eventually

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,430
as they evolve they either die out or

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,650
they just transform into companies or

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,989
they just enter a foundation of some

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,400
sort but let's focus on

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:10,169
company-sponsored open source product so

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,879
the first one which you might be

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,120
familiar with this when a company

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,970
decides to open source a byproduct of

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,849
their main one and the example I have

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,349
chosen here is a company called Basecamp

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,400
back in the days they were called

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,470
37signals

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,170
which 15 years ago open source

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,600
a framework called Ruby on Rails and you

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,760
might be familiar with that actually so

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,980
Ruby on Rails was centric which they

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,050
internally used to build their software

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,770
is a service platform called Basecamp

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,410
and one beautiful day I decided to make

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,470
it open source MIT license as far as I

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,590
remember other companies to use it so

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,830
what happened was that the product was

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,190
amazing and similar companies to them

00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:00,400
flocked in and started basing their own

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,620
solutions on top of that within this

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,650
process they also contributed back to

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,300
the platform in which case the benefit

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,120
of 37signals

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,280
/ Basecamp was that bright individuals

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,710
contributed back to the core of the

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,800
underlying framework of their own

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,740
product so they they got effectively a

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,510
lot of talent and great ideas back from

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,669
free second case and this is usually

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,790
executed by tech giants like Facebook

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,700
Google and Microsoft is when you are

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:40,300
releasing an open-source product as a

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:43,120
talent attractor as means to influence

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,630
the general direction of a certain

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,180
ecosystem of a certain space and also to

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,700
the reputation of your company amongst

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,770
tech circles the examples I have chosen

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,690
here are Facebook open source Inc react

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,030
the Google open source in angular

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,680
Microsoft and they're awesome typescript

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,330
I'm sure that the people here have some

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,130
of those technologies if not all of them

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,830
employed in the internal organization so

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,270
don't get me wrong

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:18,130
every open source project out there a

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:20,410
successful one will somehow serve as a

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,200
talent attractor and as a reputation

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,190
builder for the company but my belief is

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:32,110
that those in particular were

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:33,970
specifically for the purpose of you know

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,229
building a reputation for the company

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,930
and attracting good talent

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:42,810
third one and I'm not going to name

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,430
companies here because if I had to I

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,610
would probably name a company which I

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,009
previously worked for is is a model

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,560
which I don't really recommend because

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:57,740
it's hard to execute and more often than

00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:02,099
not unsuccessful is when you open source

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,650
stripped-down and in many cases is

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,659
functional version of your main

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,969
commercial product with the primary

00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:12,749
purpose of you know people trying it out

00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:16,800
and eventually upgrading to paid

00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:19,050
commercial version and again this is

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,050
really hard to execute because you have

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,210
mixed incentives here you are your main

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,370
incentive fees people to upgrade so

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,770
sometimes you go overboard with the

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,930
restrictions and functionalities which

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,569
you strip from what you have open

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,360
sourced and eventually turns into some

00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:41,009
form of nag where where know people who

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,169
are not really happy with it and it it

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,080
makes a bad service to the companies who

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:48,500
did this and this is actually my first

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,020
experience when we open sourced

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:56,909
commercial product so not recommending

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,099
that general forth and I am calling it

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,080
the Red Hat model and held it we are

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,529
part of the Linux Foundation this is

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,680
even you know great where essentially

00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:11,099
you have you have a very useful and

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,199
usable product being the core of

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,199
someone's business and this this core

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,550
product the Linux kernel and in fact the

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,620
entire RedHat operating system is

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,830
available for everybody to use there are

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,719
no restrictions applied on top of that

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:32,370
in this case the companies who are doing

00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:34,709
this are making money out of additional

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,130
premium services on top of it for

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:42,180
example like commercial support premium

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:45,300
features upgrades and so on and so on

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:49,230
now as you may guess by the name I have

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,769
put in within the circle this is the

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,100
model which we will

00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,230
try to achieve with 42 core that's why

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,949
we actually chose chose the name of that

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,829
and by the way goo 42 core shares its

00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:06,550
core with our commercial version of the

00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:12,189
product so we consider this to be a

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:13,929
great fit for what the 42 is as a

00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:17,019
product because we are actually

00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:18,759
integrating multiple applications of

00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,069
them being internal some of them coming

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,699
from vendors so the fact that anybody

00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:28,059
can take this platform and they can

00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:31,329
integrate it within their environments

00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:33,699
or just you know make it an option or

00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:35,410
adding for their commercial product of

00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:38,079
some sort makes perfect sense because

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,649
those people should be free to do that

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:46,569
within on their own terms without going

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:49,239
through some hoops and so on so so again

00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:52,420
this kind of a Red Hat model also

00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:55,959
suggests that multiple entities can make

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,899
profit on top of a common core by

00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,509
providing different kinds of services or

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,939
even competing with themselves while at

00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:08,199
the same time contributing to the same

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:11,740
core and main point here is that as long

00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:13,179
as this ecosystem is viable such kind of

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,389
a competition around the common core

00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:19,149
makes sense because the more value its

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:23,499
created within those circles the more

00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:25,809
there is for everybody right so that's

00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:30,519
what we are going to try and execute

00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:33,100
with the 42 core now the important bit

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,399
here related to this diagram I have

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,980
drawn is for this model to be viable and

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,369
to attract other people we obviously

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:47,079
need an entity like the finest

00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:50,220
foundation so our long-term plans and

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,689
medium-term plans are to see if we can

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,569
actually talk what we knows and see if

00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:58,720
there is a way for blue 42 core itself

00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,939
to become part of he knows will this

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,499
happen well not immediately we would

00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:04,080
like to get some feedback while it's

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,030
still on our own but

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,680
yeah that's that's a possibility which

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:13,830
we are quite open to be honest so the

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,860
next thing which is quite important is

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:21,270
the relationship between 42 Corps and

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,790
another project within finis FDC 3 which

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,940
I mentioned previously and I believe

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:30,960
that those two have a lot of synergy

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,630
between them first of all goo 42 Corps

00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,070
is going to support FDC 3 this is in our

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,780
short-term priorities and we believe

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,250
that this will be very beneficial for

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:46,050
the standard because 242 Corps is

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,630
entirely free for anybody to try on

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:52,680
their site and in fact they can

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:54,660
distribute abc3 applications without the

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,940
usual install mechanisms which are

00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,970
currently used for other entity 3

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,890
implementations so we hope that the fact

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:07,230
that 142 Corps is open and free for

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:09,900
everybody will benefit a dc-3 and the

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,290
other way around is also true in order

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,790
for goo 42 Corps to be attractive to

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,310
other vendors and for people who would

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,000
like to try it out we don't want to make

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:23,190
this vendor specific implementation and

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,110
the fact that you will be able to use

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,750
dc-3 implementation within this

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,420
environment is also a mechanism for us

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:34,110
to say well this is an environment which

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,820
is truly open so yeah that's that's

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,980
something which is really really

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,730
important for us the integration with a

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:46,260
dc-3 so next chapter of my presentation

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:49,590
is going to focus on the benefits and

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,260
challenges we have seen so far within

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,690
our journey of making good 42 core an

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,900
open source project I'm going to speak

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,250
from technical product being a product

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:05,930
manager and organizational perspective

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:08,640
so number and that's a challenge

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,840
organizational challenges that the

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,600
business people within this organization

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,660
they are saying well when we go open

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,690
source competitors are going to use and

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:22,380
steal our code

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:23,579
again let's hope that the coat is good

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,329
enough for everybody to consider

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:30,839
stealing it but my response to that is

00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:33,000
that well code this is an important task

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:37,139
to a certain extent it's a liability as

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,350
well but the greatest asset is it's not

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,899
only the code but the business behind it

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,180
the connections we have the repetitions

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,310
we have built the relationships the

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,529
communication channels our

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,990
organizational capacity executions and

00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:56,550
so on also the people behind the code

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,800
are the really important ones so I must

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,620
say that just taking a snapshot of the

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,139
code base and going somewhere and trying

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,820
to do something with it is it's not

00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,010
going to work that easy you need

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,860
significant investment it will take

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,860
something like mature and complex

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,660
product to understand its code base and

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,820
make a business around it and if you're

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,470
going to do that by the end of the day

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,630
you can actually contribute to the

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,110
common core there is no need to try

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,269
something and the final thing here is

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:31,410
that if your competitors are going to

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:33,720
rely on your source code for their

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:38,519
business then you will always be several

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:41,069
steps ahead of them right number two we

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,709
can no longer rely on security through

00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:47,069
obscurity because the code is there

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:48,930
everybody can review it and can spot any

00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:52,110
potential problems which are present in

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,110
it this is not very applicable for the

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,779
product we have but it's in general

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,880
applicable to open source project again

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,819
I believe that this is also a benefit

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,389
because this is the ultimate proof that

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,040
your product really is secure enough so

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,319
that even if the source code is out

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,339
there available for everybody check and

00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:17,940
verify it there are no visible problems

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,480
with it so yeah that's that's in in my

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,480
book

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,519
don't move proof that your product is

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,850
secure of course it has to be really

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,850
secure

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:32,770
so next this is a pure benefit the

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,020
toolchain which is available for opens

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,080
first project is project is the best

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,540
let's thank Microsoft for that but

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,420
really what's what's available right now

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:48,400
in terms of github projects previously

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,080
we had Travis which is CI and release

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,240
your software and compile it for free

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,430
all those things are really available

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,020
for free for open source projects there

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,690
are good reasons for that Microsoft

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,240
knows that open source is fueling the

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,770
software industry so they are getting a

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,770
lot of benefit from that

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,730
so yeah the more you get the more you

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,810
will receive

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:17,050
fourth bit is death to death straight

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,750
communication channel that's a benefit

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,280
and a challenge because previously

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,100
developers from different organizations

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,650
had to pass through multiple hoops in

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,440
order to obtain information or just get

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,470
somebody to help them right now with an

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,820
open-source project like that you have a

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,400
direct channel available through

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,560
standard tools which are part of github

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,170
like issues everybody knows how these

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,360
works so anybody can open an issue and

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:47,010
just ask their question and on the other

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,470
side you will get likely a response from

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,990
so that's also a challenge I guess

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,050
because developers in your organization

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,800
might not be used to being in this

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,750
client facing row which is actually the

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,180
fifth point which I have here engineers

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,510
are now on the fraud on the front line

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,490
they're your representatives so I think

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,530
that this is small key benefit because

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,920
bringing more business context and more

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,510
at what's going on on the other side of

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,970
the product is is good for them

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,770
engineers are smart people they will

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,200
understand what was going on there and

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,980
incorporate those challenges straight

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,200
into their into their code base so the

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,220
more they understand and the more they

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,700
are connected to the client the better

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,230
again some organizations and we may end

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,110
up there as well might need

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,309
dedicated community managers or support

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,870
people who are just sifting through

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,870
issues and so on and so on

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,750
yeah we are not there yet we have our

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:55,220
developers answering the issues

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:58,100
themselves six point eight point six the

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,540
one which I mentioned previously open

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,870
source projects are great talent

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,480
tractors people are there to see how

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,299
awesome your company is the processes

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,809
are out there for them to see you can

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,640
even have people you know participating

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:17,480
in your project for a while on their own

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,130
terms and they can decide if they want

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,370
to work with you so you can gradually

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,429
home board them and so on and so on

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:28,130
speaking of which 0.7 running an open

00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:31,730
source project at least if it's run

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,679
properly and not just as a dump of the

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,570
source code team inside the public

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,650
repository is a remote and global

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:47,710
process by default right because

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:50,360
essentially if you are facilitating for

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,360
external contributors this means that

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,669
all of your processes all of your

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,190
project management system so or all of

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:00,230
your issues roadmaps everything should

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,900
be out there the prostitute the process

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,150
should be explicit and most of the time

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,059
it should be also a synchronous so that

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,940
people can actually participate in that

00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:13,250
and again this means that you are free

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,660
to dip into the global talent pool you

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,169
can bring cause some people from all

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,600
over the world again in the perfect role

00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:24,880
tinting the best-run open source product

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,500
people should be a self on board without

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,000
any assistance from your site within

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,610
this project they should be able to

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,100
figure out what's it for how it's usable

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,450
and also how they can contribute back to

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:40,010
it which is like the ultimate experience

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,580
compared to the usual things where you

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:46,580
have to have somebody on board you on

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:50,090
the code base and so on and so on number

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,280
eight the final point and this is my my

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,930
favorite bit it's a pure challenge and

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,780
I'm facing

00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,790
every day and I have this awesome quote

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,870
from the first marketing manager which

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:05,140
was facing our open source initiative

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:09,820
the question was where are my NQ s that

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:12,250
you so EDL stands for marketing

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,740
qualified leads and these are usually

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,180
fleshed out through a carefully designed

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,820
process where people go through

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,030
registrations and so on and so on so

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,340
that marketing can nurture them properly

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:27,580
those projects by default allow

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,040
everybody to download and install and

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,150
use the software without any need for

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,540
authentication

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:37,000
that's what developers are used to and

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,850
they're not going to bother with a

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,940
custom design process which sales and

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:45,580
marketing people are used to that that's

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:49,240
a pure challenge I don't think that it's

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,470
not possible for it come some come by

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,900
the end of the day if people are

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,080
genuinely interested in your project and

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,120
they are going to contact you and you

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,860
will figure some way for for them to

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,900
actually get in touch with you and

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,390
probably if they're interested in the

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:08,050
product and your well-designed premium

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:11,530
services they will decide to buy them

00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:13,120
eventually the summary which I would

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,910
like to give from the lessons I have

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,780
shared so far we are in the beginning of

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:22,600
our journey but building an open-source

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,600
project definitely looks easier from

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,140
outside from the inside especially

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,440
because many companies successful ones

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,180
make it look so easy because yeah they

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,830
are just contributing the source code

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,660
everybody's just chatting around

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,400
everybody's just great in their

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,110
communication and so on and so on

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,300
so if you would from the outside it

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,340
looks really easy but it's it's not that

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:50,590
easy especially if you have not done it

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:56,440
before but it's it's an ongoing process

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:59,170
and we think here is that a presence of

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,300
a foundation like I like the finest one

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,780
it's really important because we can use

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,429
it to share lessons between each other

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,429
we can also ask

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:12,879
people to get advices of licensing

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:14,799
mechanisms on the way we are open

00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:16,419
sourcing the project all the steps

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,629
necessary to do that

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:21,700
for example 142 core is based on one of

00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:25,840
the templates prepared by Thanos which

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,389
was a really really good one so yeah

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,090
it's it's a challenge but it's great

00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:33,129
that we have somebody helping us in this

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,340
journey and the final thing is that

00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:39,090
regardless regardless of the reasons

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,889
behind open-source in the project

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,559
ultimately your team your engineering

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:48,340
team your sales marketing product teams

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:51,899
will come out better out of it because

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,909
you you will learn many lessons about

00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:57,340
your processes you will try new things

00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:59,679
you will get better communication

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,379
channels you will connect to customers

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,119
which you never previously could reach

00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:08,830
out for so yeah it's it's worth trying

00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,919
from my perspective and I really hope

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,450
that we will make it better and we will

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,639
be back

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,499
I hope a few months from now sharing

00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:23,889
more war stories again being finis

00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:35,619
method I do want to ask you about how

00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:40,240
are we going so yeah so this is the

00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:41,769
repository we have I think that the

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,960
links in the chat so you don't have to

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:46,360
read wiki those so this is the

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,269
repository for our project it's in comm

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,200
142 is the organization the repository

00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:55,389
is core we also have a website small

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,799
website which describes the purposes of

00:23:55,389 --> 00:24:02,590
the product we have and a third link is

00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:04,389
from a webinar we did one week ago which

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,669
was released webinar so you can take a

00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:09,129
look at it as well I'm really interested

00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:11,710
in the feedback not only on the product

00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:14,519
itself but on the way we have patched it

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,080
on the clarity of our documentation on

00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,789
on the things which are out there for

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,399
you to interact with without actually

00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:24,289
be as being present in guiding you

00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:26,149
through the product which is from my

00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,369
perspective the most important trait of

00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:30,649
an open-source project people should be

00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:35,239
able to unboard themselves on their own

00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:37,580
terms so yeah I guess that's it do we

00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:45,109
have any questions RIS available in each

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:47,179
other yeah if you have questions go

00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:51,409
ahead and unmute yourself if you need to

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,909
and I know Tasha are you in I am can you
