of firms

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760

but um what i'd like to introduce you to

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
is finos as a

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,440
non-profit um foundation

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,080
so we're an independent nonprofit um

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,759
membership organization whose purpose is

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,400
to accelerate collaboration and

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,240
innovation

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,319
in financial services through the

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,120
adoption of open source software

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,800
standards and best practices and what

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,560
that means is that um

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,199
finos is a non-profit um we don't have

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,280
um people who have invested you know

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,479
from a stakeholder perspective

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,479
in the foundation um so it means that we

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,759
can actually operate as a non-profit

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
independently

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
for our members and also for the

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,319

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
activities within

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
um fintech and banking and financial

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
services

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,319
in order to you know grow um

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,039
the the industry in order to you know

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,599
share

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,840
uh work that people feel would be useful

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,879
for everybody to be able to

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,840
partake and also use um

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
plus the the foundation um develops you

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
know

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,720
projects as software plus also standards

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
like fdc3

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
um which you know we're actually here to

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
focus on today

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,160
and that's what rico and chris will be

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
taking us through in a lot more detail

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
that i'm going to be taking us through

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,000
but also knowing that um

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
open sourcing fintech is pretty new um

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
to the industry

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
uh within the foundation we also educate

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,039
um

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,719
both the engineers and the developers

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,519
and the other people who are getting

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
involved in

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,320
open source plus also the firms and the

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
organizations from fintechs through to

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,640
large

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,640
banks on how to do it um and that's um

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,160
what our open source readiness program

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
is and also

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,440
um the open developer platform so we

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,519
have one for governance

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,600
um and legal and compliance and

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,800
the open developer platform is you know

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,000
the ci cd

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,080
devops um type of project that enables

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,880
developers to do things

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,720
plus as a foundation we also run events

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,640
uh we get involved you know hands-on

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,920
with our teams um

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,360
with our project teams um to teach

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,760
people how to

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,399
partake in um uh open source development

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
um and our events just like this meet-up

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,040
we've just had um

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,720
our 2020 open source um strategy forum

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
which is where all of our members come

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,680
together in order to

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
um share experiences and teach people

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,480
about open source

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,320
um but really the whole purpose of the

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
foundation is to create a global

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
community

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,040
of um contributors and collaborators

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,880
um to really innovate and push financial

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,480
services forward through the adoption of

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
open source projects

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
knowing that you know the only way that

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
we can truly transform the industry is

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,519
to collaborate as

00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:01,440
an industry um in an open apache to

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,040
licensed way so we do have

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,399
a diverse community of members um so

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,399
for example we have big banks

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
such as deutsche bank who everyone will

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
know is a big investment bank

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,279
you know with many thousands of people

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,880
globally

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,680
we also have a diverse community of

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,200
um fintech um contributors and members

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,800
as well such as um

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,279
open finn and kosaic and v42 who are

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,600
you know i'm contributing into fdc3 and

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,920
part of the fdc3 program

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,000
plus we also have um technology

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,880
companies and consultancies

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
um who bring you know a real rich input

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,399
of

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
you know what's happening in the

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,120
industry um from a technology or cloud

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,800
or other type of you know perspective um

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
in order to bring a real

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
deep um rich learning uh into the

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,440
foundation

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
from a real 360 point of view so we're

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,880
not just

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
a community of banks we have a real rich

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,920
open community

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,279
of lots of different points of view and

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,640
lots of different technologies

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,440
so um this slide here actually shows you

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,959
um who our members are um and as you can

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
see we operate across

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
um well we operate across four tiers now

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
but the

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,279
the three primary tiers um are our

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,600
platinum gold and silver members

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
um where the platinum members are

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
actually part

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,760
of the finnos board and

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,519
help you know govern and steer the

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
direction of the foundation

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
so we're not a centralized you know

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,560
group of people who are telling the

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,760
industry what to do

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,880
our platinum members and also

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,480
representatives from our gold and silver

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
membership

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,079
meet you know every quarter to help you

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,079
know govern and steer the direction

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,279
of the foundation in a very democratic

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,600
way

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
and as you can see you know part of our

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,639
platinum membership

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,880
we've recently been joined by accenture

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,399
but you'll notice that we have big banks

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
in there plus also

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,680
other technology companies um like

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,800
github

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,360
um but um we

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,279
you know are basically kind of like a

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,320
rich you know community

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,160
um of banks um such as city and jp

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,120
morgan the morgan stanley but all the

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,279
way through

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,880
our gold and silver members um which

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,240
also includes um

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,519
intel red hat susa uh trade web

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,320
wipro wells fargo um and other

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,480
you know consultancies like um epam

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,480
gri42 scotlogic

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
plus we have technology companies like

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,760
uh lab and

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,000
um cloud bees etc and so you know we do

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
mix in you know very interesting

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,480
technology circles

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
um but now we also have um an associate

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,399
membership for other

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
non-profit foundations um and we've

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,160
really

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,480
um we've just introduced um isda into

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,800
that membership and also the alliance

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,720
for innovative regulation have joined us

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,399
as well as um into the interwork

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,839
alliance and so

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,959
um we're uh working cross foundation as

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,040
well as um across

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,000
industry so why do we actually do this

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,040
so why does some

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
open source in finance ex exist so

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
really

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,920
um in a nutshell is to reduce the

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,120
overall you know software

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,720
effort so reduce um the

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
duplication of effort that's actually

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
happening across the industry

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
throughout banks and technology

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,720
companies to mutualize on you know

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,560
software projects and standards

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
which improves the time to market and

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,680
the quality of our software

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,680
plus also um attract and retain talent

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
you know which has been difficult you

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,760
know in certain

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,920
scenarios within banking that often gets

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,639
you know associated with legacy software

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
and so

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560
being part of an open source foundation

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,440
in the open source industry

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,760
dispels the myth about that it also

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,160
de-risks some software investments

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,320
and reduces um vendor lock-ins and you

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,079
know different contracts that you know

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,600
can actually slow down change within

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,240
banking plus

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
um simplifies workflows and integrations

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
in ecosystems through

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
interoperability uh which we'll hear

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,959
more about

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,000
with the fdc3 team today

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:26,160
and so as you can see you know

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,160
um by using open source software

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,320
you basically build you know this trust

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,279
relationship across the industry

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,079
you get to make um you know industry

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,199
decisions

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,160
and you know steer the industry from

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,680
a very democratic board level type

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,880
approach

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,800
but mostly you build a project once then

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,680
you share it across the industry

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,199
and it allows us to accelerate um both

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,079
in terms of velocity

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,959
um whilst being more efficient and due

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,880
and

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,160
reducing the duplication of effort they

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,760
can also build

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,079
within teams so

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,120
um the goal of open sourcing financial

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,880
services

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,920
now for finos is to build that real

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,920
dynamic enrich

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,040
diverse representation across

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
many different um industries and so not

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,279
only do we have

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,040
um financial institutions and

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,160
fintech vendors but we also welcome in

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
um the regulators into finos as well and

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
so

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,759
we're looking at driving efficiency

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,959
across you know different

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,839
industries now um which further reduces

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,040
cost and

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,800
improves efficiency plus also welcomes

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,360
different types of people and thinking

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,279
um into the financial services industry

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,079
so the more industries that are working

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,680
together

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
the more diverse the thinking and the

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,959
richer the community

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,880
and this means that we can pick up and

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,720
retain you know a greater level of

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,639
talent and also have a

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
a broader global reach which we're doing

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,680
today with um the apac

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,800
meetup and so by having

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,000
banks and big tech and regulators and

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,720
fintech vendors all um contributing

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,480
into open source um you improve

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
innovation

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,600
interoperability data standardization

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
um you create an open ecosystem and then

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,639
you also start mitigating risk across

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,519
the industry as well

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,160
so this year despite you know all of the

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,959
various

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,199
um difficulties that everybody has been

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,040
going through in 2020

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,040
it's actually been a very successful

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
year for um finos

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,959
um so this slide is actually one of the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
sites that we uh present back to our

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
board and as you can see we've had a

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
number of

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,880
um projects that have been contributed

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,480
into the foundation

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,440
um including blue more fur symphony java

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,160
toolkit and legends from goldman sachs

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,560
plus also um our community activity

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,560
through

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,120
q3 this year has also improved and

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,799
you can see the um this last quarter was

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,559
the biggest in our history of

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,720
of commits and it's actually quite a

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,720
spike that we've um realized

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,919
uh which you know obviously we need to

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,079
look at the trend

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,919
um but if this trend continues it

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,919
actually shows you know a great change

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,880
within financial services

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,559
and the way that um you know uh firms

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,079
and individuals are contributing

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:31,840
into the foundation through our projects

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,640
so um throughout 2020

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,600
we've had you know a great input

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,799
throughout the year

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,600
so we introduced open regitech um

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,760
we've improved our global footprint

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,919
there's been a retail banking expansion

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
within the foundation

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,840
we've had more ecosystems and

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,440
partnerships occur

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,720
plus we've also just had our

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,200
um 2020 ossf um

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
which was actually hosted by finos and

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,760
also the linux

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,240
foundation um and was fully online um

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,039
which was also very successful over the

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,760
last um

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,360
last couple of days well over two days

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,960
um and we had um

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,880
you know many hundreds of people come

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,799
through and also um

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
people like ricky um speaking at the

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,520
event

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,080
um but finnos isn't a foundation

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,440
that has happened over this year um

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,480
we've actually got a rich

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,440
um history and evolution

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,880
which actually started in 2015 uh

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,200
through the creation of the symphony

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,600
software foundation

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,360
but then we pivoted um around 2018

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,400
when uh the shift in the industry

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,520
um from you know uh being

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,799
uh focused solely on banking became a

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,080
lot more diverse

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,039
um with the expansion of fintech and the

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
expansion of

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,440
innovation within financial services and

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
so there was a decision made by the

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,720
finnos board

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,200
to create um a more diverse and rich

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,480
landscape for the foundation and that's

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,720
where philos was born

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,679
in order to encompass the entire

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,240
industry

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,080
um and not just solely focus on you know

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,120
the expansion of open source within

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,880
symphony

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,559
and then i'm really pleased to announce

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
that um this year

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
um we merged with the linux foundation

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
which means that not only

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,720
are we part of you know a rich and

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,400
diverse financial services industry

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,919
but we're also part of the rich and

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,000
diverse linux

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,000
foundation community as well

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,320
so 2020 will be a bright year for

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,880
open sourcing financial services um

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,160
through

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,480
um joining the linux foundation and what

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,640
that actually means is that finos

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
plus the linux foundation can actually

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,120
um collaborate

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,160
to bring global expansion uh

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,280
training and certification um events and

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
infrastructure

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,840
and also improving our upstream and our

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,520
reach you know throughout the industries

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,919
and so with all of the experience of

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,159
finos plus also the experience and the

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,720
rich history of the linux foundation

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
um we're we're hoping and we're focusing

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,679
on

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
um a good you know focus for our

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
projects you know throughout the entire

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,799
you know global

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,520
reach of open source um

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,760
and so the value of phineas and the

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,679
linux foundation joining forces

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,960
is that we get to expand ourselves

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,880
within a rich and

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,039
more diverse um uh global community

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,559
which also includes a rich and diverse

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,960
you know array of projects

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,600
and also a vast community whilst

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,679
providing

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
all of the value-added services around

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
event management

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
training and certification plus

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,520
community engagement like what we're

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,000
doing today

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
so i think i've covered the the why the

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,640
house and the what's

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
um what i'd like to talk through now is

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,159
um

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,320
the attributes of open source so the

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,200
ability for us all to collaborate

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,159
so it's our hope that by running a meet

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
up like this

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,240
we get to know each other we get to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,080
communicate openly

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,919
and we get to collaborate you know

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,280
through that community in an open and

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,600
transparent way

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,440
and by doing so we get to innovate on

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
different solutions and come up with you

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,200
know

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,360
new and improved ideas for

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,600
uh creating projects and expanding the

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
industry

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,760
now this isn't um a new thing it's not

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,400
like an ideology

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,640
of james macleod at finas um as you can

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,320
see you know open source has been around

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,000
you know since you know

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,679
so i don't know he's come off mute but

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
there's a little bit of background noise

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,919
there

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,520
um but there's um

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,600
so you can see through the introduction

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,480
of big data through to cloud

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,520
through to nosql and blockchain big data

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,320
etc

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,320
um the open source is actually rich

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
all right so uh wait i've actually put

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
you on mute um

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
i hope you don't mind but i'm i can hear

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
your background um

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,840
but um yeah so moving on so i don't um

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,960
take up anybody else's time um finos

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,840
actually creates

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,640
and um provides the technical

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,280
infrastructure

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,840
community and legal governance that's

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
needed

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,440
you know within this industry in order

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,720
for the industry to grow

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
and also be um successful so we do

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
provide

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,480
you know infrastructure uh the community

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,400
of open source contributors

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,159
and also because we are a regulated

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,320
industry we do have

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
legal governance as well for people who

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,480
want to get involved in open source but

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
are

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
unsure of you know what that means for

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,720
them partaking in this industry

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,960
so within the foundation today we're

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
here to talk about ftc3

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,440
um but we do have you know a wide array

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,280
of other projects as well

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,440
um this um slide shows that um we have

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,480
you know projects such as legend by

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
goldman sachs

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,640
that's been contributed by goldman sachs

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,679
perspective by jp morgan

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,720
uh waltz um by deutsche bank

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,799
and morpher by morgan stanley

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,080
um plus we have different types of

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,799
software projects

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
um of which this is a an array of days

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,400
as well

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,039
so it's rich and diverse um

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
plus also data projects as well such as

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,799
um

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,640
data hub data helix and also legends um

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,559
so you know we're not just software and

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,039
standards we also get involved in

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,000
synthetic data generation and also

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,720
modeling

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
through legend

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,080
so just to conclude are you ready to

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,440
join

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,159
the finos open source community if so

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
there are you know five key ways that

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,159
you can do that

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
you can come to um github.com for such

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,200
finnos and

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
evaluate our software and standards you

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,760
can consume

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,400
you know those software and standards

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,760
and start using then start participating

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,159
in conversations

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,919
then start contributing back should you

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,240
you know become confident to do so

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,679
and you would like to do that and then

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
ultimately

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,840
if you would like to become a maintainer

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,400
of a project you can grow your career

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,679
into a leadership style you know career

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
in open source

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,320
um in fintech and start leading projects

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
but ultimately there's a link at the

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,279
bottom of this slide to our get involved

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,559
page on finnos.org which gives you more

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,640
information of how to get involved

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,760
so everybody here you're now part of the

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
finnos community

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,679
thank you for joining the meetup today

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,200
but you can also find us on

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,279
github on twitter and also linkedin

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
and with that i'd like to quickly hand

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,880
over to ricoh

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,679
eckstein he's going to talk more about

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,679
ftc3

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,840
i thank you very much james

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,600
can everybody see my screen

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,240
yes we can perfect

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,799
uh it's really great to be with you this

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,080
morning

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,400
um i uh i have

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,279
tried to condense my talk that i gave at

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,640
ossf

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:22,000
uh recently um about ftc3 uh

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,840
into a very short sort of lightning talk

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,120
um i'm going to breeze through a few

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,360
things

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,159
but hopefully it will make sense to you

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,200
and

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,720
if if anything doesn't then please ask

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,279
some questions at the end

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,279
or or get in touch with me i'm after

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,559
today's meeting

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,559
uh so i'm

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,919
what am i going to talk about just very

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,200
briefly who i am

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,559
uh you know why fdc3 um

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,279
exists uh what it is um

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,679
i'm gonna show you very briefly how you

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,080
can

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,760
build an ftc three workflow uh in in

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,400
just five steps

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,720
and and then just talk a bit about how

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,520
fgc3 is used out there in the real world

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,919
and

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,039
um and how you can get involved in the

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,360
community

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,159
uh and and that's all really just to

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,159
lead into

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,000
to the really cool stuff that chris is

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,880
going to show you in a few minutes

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
um so i don't want to to impede on his

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,600
time

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,679
i'm going to try and uh keep things

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,440
short

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,000
so i am a software developer

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,480
um i i grew up in in cape town in south

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,080
africa i i now live and work in london

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,159
and i've been involved in the finance

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,960
industry for quite a while

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
and i'm i'm the head of desktop strategy

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,200
at adapter financial

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,679
consulting where um you know we build

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,720
bespoke software solutions clients and

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
we also

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,039
are very happy to be a finos member and

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,320
and be involved in the community

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:55,520
and and i uh co-chair the fdc3

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,120
project at finos uh

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,080
so why why ftc3 why did it come into

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,640
being

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,200
uh well if if you think about it um you

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
know for

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,720
for up until recently especially in the

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,080
in in the financial industry on on

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,080
desktops

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,200
people have been building applications

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,640
much like this

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,480
you have all of the benefits of

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,159
microservices on the back end

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
but people are still building big

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,399
monolithic

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,600
client applications on the front end

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,919
regardless of

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,720
really what technology it's it's built

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,399
in

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,120
so over the last few years

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,679
driven in in part by the fact that

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
people

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,840
use many different applications and

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,320
often multiple monitors together

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,520
in the financial industry firms have

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,559
started doing

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,039
more of this kind of thing where you

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,000
start

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,880
breaking up those big monolithic

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,720
applications

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,640
into smaller pieces uh and this allows

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,279
you to work across many screens it

00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,720
allows you to compose workflows together

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,760
and um and there are many vendors in the

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
space that that

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,279
provide the ability especially with web

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,440
technologies

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,799
to to run them in windows on your

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,200
desktop

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,399
and and actually have multiple pieces of

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,240
functionality

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:19,120
working together um so

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,840
uh the interesting thing about this kind

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,320
of setup

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,399
is that uh if you think about

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,640
microservices at the back end

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,480
really you need an orchestrator to help

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,640
you you need a way to deploy and

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,320
discover all of the microservices you

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,159
need a way that you can

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,679
and that they can communicate with each

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,440
other and

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,919
on the back end people often use tools

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
like kubernetes nowaday to do nowadays

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
to

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,039
to help you do that and really the same

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
is true on the front end if you're going

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,919
to have all of these

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,799
micro front ends um it's

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,200
much more beneficial if if you can make

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,000
it easy to deploy and discover them

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,679
um also to compose them together into

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,600
into workspaces

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,000
various things like that and

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
for ensembl who who chris will talk

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,559
about later is one of the tools that

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,559
allow you to do that

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,000
however um you know just like with

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,240
microservices on the back end

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,240
uh there's kind of a need for for

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,000
standardization and simplification of

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,120
the patterns that people can

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,120
use to do that so

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,039
uh that is where ftc three comes in and

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,320
in ftc three we have this concept of a

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,399
desktop agent

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,520
which is really um the orchestrator for

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,960
micro front ends

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,480
and ftc three uh comes out of patterns

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,279
that people have been using for quite a

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,200
while

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,000
so it's not it's not an implementation

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,399
or a framework

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,080
it's a standard that others can then

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,640
implement and use and that people can

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,000
write applications to and

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,120
what it allows is for us to start

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,679
uh connecting the micro front ends

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,960
together

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,080
into compelling user workflows

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,640
so that's the space that ftc 3 operates

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,640
in why is that important

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,480
well it helps organizations to reduce

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
costs

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,039
to create and unlock new opportunities

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,760
in their businesses

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,600
and also to leverage network effects

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,200
i've done some talks in the past and

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:33,279
on these benefits and and more detail on

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,120
why uh componentization on the desktop

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,960
allows organizations to see these

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,399
benefits please go and

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,240
and search for one of those talks if

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,000
you're interested or give me a shout

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,440
and unfortunately i don't have time to

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
go into that more today

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,559
so you know if we want to leverage those

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,960
benefits

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,000
um if we want to have componentized

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
desktops what

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,640
is ftc3 then or it stands for the

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
financial desktop connectivity and

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,519
collaboration consortium

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:09,760
it was started by openfin um in 2017

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:13,600
and contributed to finos uh

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,080
around i think 2017 or 2018

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,880
as one of the the earlier um phenos

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,159
projects

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,000
you know so we've been around for a

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,279
while last year the

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,039
1.0 specifications in the htc 3

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,279
standards were released

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,840
and in april of this year we released

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,640
the 1.1 specifications at the moment the

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,799
community is

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,320
actively working on the next version

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,480
version 1.2

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,760
and the amount of contributions and

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,240
collaboration

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,720
is just increasing uh you know which is

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,799
wonderful to see

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,559
if you want to learn more about ftc 3

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,080
our web portal

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,360
is at ftc3.finos.org we also

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,480
recently um published

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,320
an ftc 3 package to npm for those

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
web applications that want to use the

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,320
standard to make it even easier

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,399
um that's still in alpha but uh

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,600
we're actively working on that as well

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,000
and um ftc3 being a standard is made out

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,440
of

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
four specifications the first is

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,240
an app directory which is really a

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,039
standard for a shared way to register

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,519
and discover applications

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,399
intents which you might have come across

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,799
if you've ever done

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,519
android development it's really a way to

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,279
express

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,519
a shared set of well-known

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,960
actions that applications can register

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
and invoke on one another

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,480
they don't need to know anything else

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,000
about one another they just declare

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,440
their intents and then they can be

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,200
referenced so

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,919
for example uh there is a

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,559
view chart intent in ftc3 which allows

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,399
you

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,080
an application to say i want to view a

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,000
chart and then

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,440
another application will be launched

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,279
that knows how to

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,480
display a chart uh what goes closely

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,919
along with that

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,720
is the the concept of the data that you

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,440
need to

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,960
provide to be to make these applications

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,000
work

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:18,240
so it's a shared schema and envelope for

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,760
transferring data between applications

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,360
if you're viewing a chart you probably

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
need to provide the details about the

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,880
instrument

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,600
that you want to view the chart for and

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,640
fdc3 has a standardized schema for

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,279
instruments for example and finally some

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,159
lightweight

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,480
apis operations that pull all of this

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,399
together and makes

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,480
it gives provides the ability for

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,480
applications to collaborate

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,559
um you know and these four

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,360
specifications together

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,640
they sort of become like the smart glue

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,279
with which you can

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,760
connect uh workflows together

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,039
right so so let's try and make it a bit

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,200
more practical

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:04,480
um i have uh in my talk recently

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,480
um at ossf i i went through in quite a

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,440
lot of detail about

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,919
how you can with just five steps design

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,040
an ftc three workflow on desktops today

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,960
to run in an ftc 3 compliant desktop

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,440
agent

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,960
the most important part the most

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,119
important step really is

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,639
that we're not thinking in terms of a

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,119
single application anymore we're

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,000
thinking

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,000
of multiple components working together

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,119
so we need to design the workflow and

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,520
behavior of those

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,679
pieces together once we've done that

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,760
we can define the actions between those

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,720
applications we can model the data that

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
they need

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,240
we register them with the the desktop

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,359
agent

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,560
and then we use the ftc 3 apis to put it

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,079
all together

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,079
i'd love to show you those steps in a

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,240
bit more detail if you're interested

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,919
um reach out you know i can maybe come

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,920
and do a talk at your organization i'll

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,800
be happy to do that

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,720
today i'm just going to to flick through

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000
those slides and maybe highlight one or

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,000
two things

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,839
so so this is the the workflow i

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,720
designed it's sort of a

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,200
click to trade for fx workflow you can

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,280
see

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,520
how you uh you look at the actions that

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,359
are needed between the two applications

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,400
to make them work together

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,440
and then you know in in this case we

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,119
then use the workflow to

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,880
to figure out that well we need an

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,040
execute trade action which we're going

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,000
to use in ftc 3 intent for

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,880
we need to send some data back which is

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,920
we're going to use an fcc3 channel for

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,119
and that gives us the pieces of glue

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,520
we need to be able to pull to compose

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,599
these two applications together

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,800
which is the execute trade intent the

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,920
channel name

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,240
and the two pieces of data and then we

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,280
can use json schema to go and

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,040
model the data and the payloads that

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
need to be transferred between the two

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,800
applications

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,960
and then we register them with the

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,720
desktop agent

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,280
so uh you know once we've done that

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,000
we add them to the app directory for

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
that agent

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
which allows the one application to

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,200
invoke the other

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
one of the applications need to specify

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,599
which intents

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,560
it supports and finally we can go and

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,800
use

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,560
the ftc3 apis to

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
to raise an intent in the one

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,000
application which

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,599
the other application will then listen

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,480
to and

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,280
send the result back on a channel and it

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,560
really is as simple as that

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,720
and just to to show you i have a quick

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,720
demo of that in action

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,920
so if you'll bear with me and what i

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,320
have here is

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,560
an ftc 3 1.1 desktop agent

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,599
which runs in the browser just with tabs

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,359
in the browser

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,520
and you can launch an application by

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,000
clicking on it this is the workflow that

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,280
i've just

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,160
spoken about so if you click in one

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,320
application

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,920
that will launch the other on demand and

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,560
um that will then uh accept or reject

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,760
the trade

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,880
using ftc three operations payloads

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,960
and standardized intents to to

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,480
pull the workflow together the great

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,000
thing is i can

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,599
run this workflow in in multiple

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,720
ftc 3 compatible desktop agents

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,079
so what i've got here is um

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,359
a the same apps running

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,480
in a in desktop windows um it's just web

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,880
apps hosted

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,680
in electron effectively but i can do

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,760
exactly the same thing

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:53,040
using using desktop windows

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,839
this is the same web apps running by the

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,359
way i haven't

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,280
i'm not running them in a different way

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,200
or anything i'm just changing the

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,160
ftc three compliant desktop agent that

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,320
i'm using and exactly the same workflow

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,960
works in the same way and that is the

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,000
promise of ftc3

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,400
so uh yeah just to conclude

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,400
um you know out in the real world people

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
are using ftc three today

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,440
um there's a case study on our website

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,720
where we worked with

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,320
natwest markets to build a um

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,079
rfq trading workflow using symphony chat

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,520
using ensembl that chris is going to

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,960
talk about in a moment

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,839
um using rfq desktop components built in

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,839
dot net wpf and web technologies all

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,680
collaborating together into a seamless

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,640
workflow for users

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,200
for for sales people for traders um and

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,000
using

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,079
ftc3 elements and and that's the kind of

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,560
things that we do at adaptive we build

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,440
bespoke software solutions for clients

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,320
using um you know open source tools our

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,839
partners

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,520
please come and speak to us if you'd

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,119
want to find out more

00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,400
um how did you get involved in ftc3

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,160
uh just go and google for it i is is the

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,960
easy answer

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,400
um you know you can go to our web portal

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,960
you can join our mailing list

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,240
uh joining the meetings is probably a

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,960
bit difficult for apac

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,640
because of time zones but if we have

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,359
enough interest we can definitely make a

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,599
plan

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,400
with regards to that but yeah our

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,680
website has

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,240
information about how to get involved

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,000
and that's all i have for today please

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,640
give me a shout uh if you'd like to

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,240
chat more thank you very much and i

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,480
guess over to chris

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,680
well rico before we pass over to chris

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,960
there is actually one

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:43,760
uh question from randall um in chat and

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:47,680
that is does fdc3 support web assemblies

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,480
um so ftc3 being a standard um is not

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,720
opinionated it it is about patterns for

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,960
applications to collaborate right

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,079
so it can be implemented in any

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,040
technology

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,440
um you know so there's no reason you you

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,119
could

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,400
you couldn't use it with web assemblies

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,079
thank you very much so chris over to you

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,720
thank you

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,160
so i'm chris west and director of

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,040
solutions engineering at

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,240
cosec where me and my team help people

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,400
get started with

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,520
ensembl our desktop container for

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,720
finance

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,200
um which supports fdc3 in fact

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,640
all four of the standards that rico

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,520
mentions

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,079
now ensembles used to build out what we

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,480
call

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
smart desktop applications which are

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,839
essentially

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,160
um composite applications running on a

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,359
desktop um

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,960
across many many screens in finance that

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,440
bring together lots of component

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,599
applications one of the tools

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,359
to bring those together that we use is

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,359
ftc3

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,960
so when building out what we call a

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,920
smart desktop one of the first things

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,839
you're going to need

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,079
is a launcher of some sort that can

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,640
launch your component applications

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,680
and with ensembl you can pre-configure a

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,319
variety of launcher menus

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,800
however for some use cases you want your

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,200
users to be able to build out their own

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,040
launcher setup so in ensembl we have

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,520
what we call our advanced launcher

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,720
which gives you the ability to browse

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,079
lots of applications

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,240
sort of organize them into folders so

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,319
for example here i can make a folder for

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,240
my various charts applications

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,560
like charts uh so let's pop a couple in

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,560
here

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,040
i've got a range chart here somewhere

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,079
and okay i can start to build my own

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,680
launcher menu

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,160
but these were all pre-configured apps

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,400
what i actually want to do is draw down

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,319
um a much larger catalog which uh

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,560
we're gonna navigate and be able to add

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,319
more applications into our setup

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,880
so if i'm working for a large financial

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,280
organization as i'm sure many of you are

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
there

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,400
there are potentially hundreds of

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,480
applications in-house

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,319
so you need a way to navigate the set

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,880
and be able to choose the things you

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,040
want

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,119
so here we use ensemble's app catalog

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,480
which will let me see details on various

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,160
applications

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,920
so for example my order management

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,280
system or

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,599
it's on something a bit more visually

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,560
interesting like uh the chat eq advanced

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,240
chat

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,119
i can have a look at these get some

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,839
screenshots read some release notes etc

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,800
and ultimately uh go and add them to my

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,119
launcher so

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,760
for example i'll pick a couple here at

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,520
salesforce contacts and superchat

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,200
i've added those in if we go up to my

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,119
launcher now

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,800
uh i should be able to find these guys

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,400
down in my list there we go salesforce

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,960
contacts and superchat

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,800
i can go ahead and launch these or um

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,000
let's add some shortcuts to my launch

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,319
bar

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,079
let's do a few that we're going to use

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:51,200
here

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:54,400
okay so once we got some applications

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:59,839
um that were able to launch

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,839
which was a bit of luck

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,200
um it's time to start thinking about how

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,359
they work together and that's the job of

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,520
the fdc3 desktop agent

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,119
api that rico mentioned that works

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,359
together with the standard for intent

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,599
and context that'll allow us to start

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,520
building links between the applications

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,800
without prior coordination between their

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,599
developers

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,079
um so here i've launched a blotter based

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,160
on

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,359
um it's an 8g grid library

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,800
and i have built

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,280
into it the ability to raise an intent

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,880
so in this case i want to be able to

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,040
view a chart

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,480
for a particular ticker symbol that

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,359
might have a set of orders

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,040
on so let's go ahead and hit that and

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,960
that can go ahead and

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,000
look at all the applications we have

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,640
available configured in with ensembl

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,160
that support that intent and the context

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,800
that's going to pass to it in this case

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,040
an instrument with a ticker symbol and

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,880
it can present me a set of options for

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,079
the charts i could spawn so let's go

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,119
ahead and

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,720
pick that chart q advanced chart pop him

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,880
up and he's there

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,319
showing me what's going on with tesla's

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,880
pricing at the moment

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,359
now there's multiple different apps that

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,760
could

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,119
serve that intent so let's go ahead and

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,839
have another

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,599
i think something is messing with my my

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,000
uh zeb indexes a bit here

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,599
um but let's go grab a market depth

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,160
chart

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,160
one of those

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,839
lay it out okay so i'm able to spawn a

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,359
couple of things

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,440
with that interaction now it's the

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,520
desktop agent's job to know what apps

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,560
support that standardized and intent

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,079
concept

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,400
um and with the help of an intent

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,240
resolver dialogue awesome ui built into

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,680
a component as you can do all of this

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,560
programmatically so you can have your

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,400
own ui for picking the applications

00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,760
uh but it allows us to pick something we

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,520
have pre-installed

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,640
that the developer of this application

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,480
didn't have to know anything about

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,640
um so let's have

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,240
another go at this um ultimately this is

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,000
the goal of the fpc3

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,839
standard to enable this sort of

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,680
integration between products

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,440
without their authors having to

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,480
coordinate on standards for the

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,599
communication

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,000
the api is to invoke each other etc so

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,280
let's

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,280
do this one more time different symbol

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,720
and um i can also

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,920
put some of these out of the way uh pick

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,839
uh an existing

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,960
instance of an application to apply this

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,760
to so

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,880
for example if i pick the advanced chart

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,000
here

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,920
um i can instead of creating a new one

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,160
as we did before we can pick an existing

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,880
instance and send our context over there

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,400
so if you see it's updated and because

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,760
they're both listening to the desktop

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160
agent's global channel

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,760
the other component will also go to the

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,040
same place

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,200
um but what if we got half a dozen

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,040
screens of these components already that

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,560
global channel may not be what we want

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,800
there so

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,119
um the desktop agent also has support

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,440
for working with color channels

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,160
um that allow you to control how the

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,319
components

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,440
are linked together so with news

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,960
ensembles

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,119
and the color channel linker api here

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,119
we'll place each of these on the same

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,160
channel

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,800
yeah we'll go everyone

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,319
yellow channel and in this case i've

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,680
added a double click action

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,240
to my uh hd grid here which will allow

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,480
me to

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,960
broadcast the context on the channel

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,720
rather than raising an intent so we can

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,800
say to anyone who's listening my

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,040
instrument has changed

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,720
to something else like let's have some

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,280
ibm here

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,400
where we could start to have a look

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,480
around

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,160
without having to invoke another

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,640
dialogue do extra clicks

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:08,560
etc um to change our context

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,040
so um hopefully saving your users lots

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,200
of work

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,880
and ultimately converting these screens

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,920
and screens

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,760
of applications that traders have

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,800
potentially more screens and more apps

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,640
than uh used in most other industries

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,079
instead of turning these into work and

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,240
windows that they have to interact

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,400
with you know each time they want to get

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,440
some pricing for something having to

00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,640
hop on over and enter a ticker symbol

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,040
manually doing

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,319
copy and paste operations we turn that

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,800
into a couple of clicks

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,400
converting all of these components uh

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,559
they're working on their desktop into a

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,240
sort of head-up display for the trader

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,240
allowing them to get the information

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,359
they needed at glance rather than having

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,200
to

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:54,319
interact with each individual thing

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,960
now to prove this isn't a one trick

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,079
we are going to do that all this again

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,559
with another

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,680
component here i've got a sort of

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,599
simulated

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,079
or in-house order management system

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,960
which as you can see is as beautiful as

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,680
any in-house water management system um

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,040
but

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,040
as orders come in

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,640
which turns out

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,839
that my demo hotkey is also a webex

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,480
hotkey here

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,440
um i think we've lost the screen share

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,280
chris

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:35,839
ah there we go i'm not enjoying the

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,839
webex experience this morning

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:44,960
here we go have we got it back

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:47,359
we do okay so uh word to the wires the

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,400
don't use ctrl shift o as the hotkey in

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,000
your demo

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,520
as it ends the screen sharing webex

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,559
but we can

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,480
do this in lots of different

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,280
applications so we can pick up the same

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,559
sort of

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,040
user experience multiple times so

00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,040
for example pick up our trade history

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:13,119
here

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:13,119
and uh let's do another one

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,359
it's okay couple uh but we can also sort

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,440
of interact with them

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,440
a bit more intelligently uh using the

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,800
api so for example

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,599
knowing that i'm linked to these

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,359
applications instead of bringing up

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,960
content resolver we can just simply

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,960
start pushing context around

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,920
doing what we need to do in english

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,839
okay back to you james and rico

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,880
thank you very much chris i'm actually

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,480
gonna pass some back over to andrew

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,960
um so andrew i don't know if you would

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,880
like to coordinate the q a if anybody's

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,440
got any questions

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,240
yeah thank you james um i i'm gonna

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,480
answer

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,240
probably a question that is uh is front

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,319
of everyone's mind right now

00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,839
um you're probably all burning to ask

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,760
this question but

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,760
uh the answer is no it is not a

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,800
prerequisite uh that you need to have a

00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,079
beard to be

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,079
a member of finos

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,520
so with with that out of the way uh just

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:24,160
open it to the floor to see whether

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,760
anyone on the line has a question for

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,880
either james

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,680
chris or rico i'm sure in the next seven

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,200
minutes or so

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,559
they'd be happy to answer any uh

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,559
anything that you've got on your mind

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,160
just to be clear a beer does affect your

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,839
membership

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,839
status though

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,359
that's that's why i have the most lowly

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,359
status i think

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,000
right so it's not unusual for people to

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,319
be uh to be a little shy on these calls

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,319
so

00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,160
you know of course we're happy to uh

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,680
