over to denise

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
um welcome to today's session thank you

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,680
so much

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,319
james and and welcome everybody um

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
so i'm here to talk about fear of open

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,959
source and some of the common fears that

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,200
we hear over and over again when we talk

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,519
to new industries that are just getting

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,000
started in the open source area

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,920
so first i wanted to give you my twitter

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
handle just in case you were going to

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
tweet this thing

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
because it wasn't on the intro slide

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,640
that i was given by the penis guys

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,519
and here we go

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,280
so first of all i'd like you to know

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
that you're afraid of open source

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,720
mostly because somebody tried really

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,040
hard to make you afraid of open source

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
20 years ago there was a concerted

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,959
effort by

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,120
a handful of companies whose business

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,879
models were directly in the crosshairs

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
of the open source world

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,239
you have to remember that open source

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,040
happened around the same time as

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,280
napster and people were looking at the

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,840
violent changes happening in the online

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,799
music industry

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,799
hello hi

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,440
uh don't worry i'm keeping an eye on

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,840
people's um

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
mutants okay just keep on going thank

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,959
you yeah

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
the only music industry was scaring the

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
pants off of

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,319
the traditional um software industry

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
and so notably microsoft but not only

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,040
microsoft

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
were doing everything they could to

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,280
spread fear uncertainty and doubt

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,360
about open source and it was a

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
surprisingly concerted effort they

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
actually

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
hired attorneys to write fake white

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
papers

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,280
about open source licensing to create

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,400
some doubt there

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,640
they did a lot of lobbying within the

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,360
markets where they were you know

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,319
most influential to keep it out of those

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
places

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,040
it was a whole thing and a lot of the

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,759
questions that we get asked

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,840
today are still the same ones that they

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,320
seeded way back then

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,759
so um now that microsoft is a friend of

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
open source it's pretty

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,639
entertaining actually i was asked by

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
microsoft a couple of months ago to give

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,600
a talk

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
about the history of microsoft's journey

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
in open source

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
and which i researched i actually talked

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
to a lot of people

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
you know went over a lot of olds uh

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,040
spent some time in the wayback machine

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
you know to to look at exactly what

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,360
happened when

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
and what i discovered was that um they

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
are

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,080
pretty much unaware of that road map

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,199
that they were on

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,520
two days after my talk uh brad smith who

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,960
was the head attorney at microsoft when

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
i worked there and instilled the head

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
attorney

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
admitted publicly that they had gotten

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,520
it wrong about open source so that's

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
pretty great to hear

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,199
there were a couple of other things that

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
happened though the sko case which was

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
some people

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,360
at the santa cruz operations trying to

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,880
shake some money out of ibm

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,600
for supposedly using their code without

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,680
permission

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
because some of their code they said had

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,520
made it into

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
uh linux and there were some documents

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,680
claiming that that was a gift they gave

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,080
to the linux community

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
ibm to their credit stayed the course on

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,680
that long

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,840
lawsuit and expensive lawsuit to make

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
sure that the sko threat was completely

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,639
dead

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,639
that the linux kernel's provenance was

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,280
completely explored and that everybody

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
agreed that

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,199
linux was not ripping anybody off

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,080
another big fear moment that this this

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
community had

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
was recently when the heartbleed thing

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
happened

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,479
and what that exposed was that there

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,759
still are

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,000
some key pieces of the internet

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,880
tooling which are mostly open source

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,240
pieces

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
that are under surveilled meaning that

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
they

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
didn't have much community built around

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,639
the piece that broke which meant that

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,680
there wasn't anybody looking to see

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,160
if problems had entered the picture

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
so the security model was was not as

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,240
solid as it needed to be

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
but it gained a lot of very quick

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,680
support from the

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
money behind open source to make sure

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
that never ever ever

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
ever happens again and a lot of

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,919
companies will tell you about their

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
contributions to making sure that that

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,520
doesn't happen again

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,639
okay on to the fears this is the number

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
one fear that i

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,680
hear from financial institutions and

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,160
also curiously from municipalities

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
that it's too hard to find support

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,199
because

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,440
people who sub out their their

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
development often want a throat to choke

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,800
if something goes wrong

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,199
but interestingly enough the probably

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
most

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
famous open source based company in the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,919
world red hat

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,199
their whole business model was offering

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,479
premium support

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,479
on their versions of the open source

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
software that people came to

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,479
uh be dependent on so their their

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,880
software was always open

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,560
you could always compile it yourself

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,400
well there was a minute there where that

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
changed but the open source community

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,360
helped them back to the right road very

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,599
quickly and you know they sold for

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
hundreds of millions billions of dollars

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,720
to ibm

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,560
based partly on their install base but

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
also partly on their mastery of that

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,599
business model

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
and because that business model has been

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,479
so successful

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,440
it's quite easy now to buy top quality

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,960
support for your open source project

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,080
it's a little bit trickier if you're

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,560
doing your own

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,879
modifications which is why we always

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,599
advocate to send your modifications back

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
upstream

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,280
so that they can be supported in the

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,879
main product because it just makes it

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,240
easier for you

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,319
so hopefully this first myth

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,879
it's quite possible to find proper

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,919
support now

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,199
then they're concerned that open source

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,120
code or somehow the unwashed masses

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
this is a picture from burning man where

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
they really literally

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
are the unwashed masses and there are a

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
lot of programmers that go to burning

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
man

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,120
but open source programmers are the best

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
programmers in the world

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,279
they are paid more money because they're

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,279
willing to work in the clear

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,240
the fact that they're willing to allow

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,240
their software to be inspected just

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
means that they're more careful

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
going into it nobody wants to be

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,080
publicly embarrassed they

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
feel confident that they're at the place

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,360
where they can defend

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
the choices they've made in their code

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
and

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
you know there are so many companies

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,160
that wouldn't exist without the work of

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,839
these excellent developers at this point

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,080
calling them the unwashed masses is a

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,080
little unfair i think

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,279
okay next we have

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,600
the question of security and this was a

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
huge issue at the beginning of open

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
source microsoft spent a lot of time

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,399
trying to undermine

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,480
open source based alone on security

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
they kept saying how can it be secure if

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,279
everybody can see the code

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
and they were betting that people would

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,360
fall for that

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,000
because of the prevalent notion during

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
world war

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,279
ii that secrets needed to be kept

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
but the truth is security through

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,360
obscurity has been shown to be

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,920
a complete crock a long time ago

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,920
but just to be clear about this when i

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,600
was starting out in open source i was

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,880
working with a gentleman named whitfield

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,440
diffie

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
and whit diffy is the co-inventor of

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
diffie-hellman encryption

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,480
he was the chief security officer at sun

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
and

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,080
you know diffie-hellman encryption is

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
what makes it possible to do commerce on

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,079
the web

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,399
so i asked him what he thought about

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
open versus closed security

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
and he thought about it a long time

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,160
before he answered me what he said was

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,000
i see no statistical proof that either

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,040
system is better

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,680
but we can look at the qualitative data

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
that shows us how much faster the

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
response to

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,079
a known vulnerability is in the open

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,519
source world

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,440
it's measured in hours not weeks or

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,560
months like it is in the proprietary

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
side

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,640
so that tends to have me believe that

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
open source is inherently more secure

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,399
and then as a

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,160
as a little kicker to that he said you

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
know we do know that most

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,000
malicious acts of code are perpetrated

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
by disgruntled employees who have access

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,680
to proprietary code that's not

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
surveilled very carefully

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,480
so you can think about that for a minute

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,480
generally it's believed now that the way

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,600
that open source security is handled

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,839
is the gold standard for security and

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,959
it is everywhere it is in mission

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
critical

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,040
you know or or life critical

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,640
uses every day and you better believe

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,720
that those people double check

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,399
they look carefully before they

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,480
incorporate new software

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
but they're generally not having to fix

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,480
those problems

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,560
all right then there's the concern

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,880
that there's there's sort of not defined

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
rational decision making going on and

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,760
this is sort of like the unwashed masses

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
fear

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,800
this is another one that was seeded a

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
long time ago

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,079
but the truth is these days all of the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
major projects

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
have very defined decision making

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
process

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,079
the a lot of press was given to the

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,959
apache software foundation

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,839
deciding that you could assume goodwill

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,760
you could assume that you're going to be

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,680
fine and be ready to roll back your

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,519
changes if somebody objects

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,120
right that's so that's sort of their

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,240
motto so that they can keep moving

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
forward

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,720
but what's interesting about that is

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,000
they have a very defined process and

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
they actually vote

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,079
on all of the important things if it's a

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
major change

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,720
if it's the entry of a new person into a

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,279
level of responsibility

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,120
if it's accepting a new project into the

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,040
organization

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
considering a project top level

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,320
considering a project ready for release

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,000
all of these things require actual votes

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,160
not rochambeau votes but a real voting

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
and all of those decisions are both

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,079
documented

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
and archived so that you can go look at

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,760
them again

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,320
so in many ways open source is far

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,040
better

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,519
in the in terms of how decisions are

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
made

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,880
how they're documented whether or not

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,760
you can um

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,639
inspect them and there's very little

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,639
chaos about it

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,120
okay now we have the difficult problem

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,600
of how do i make money if i don't own

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,360
the intellectual property

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,760
okay this might be a little bit of a new

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,279
idea to you guys it's it's been

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,240
talked about in the open source world

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,600
for a long time the patent system as we

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,600
know it was designed

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,800
for physical mechanical inventions

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,680
and as such the pace of change was much

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,839
slower

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,200
the expertise that was required to make

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,880
a good determination about the

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,079
uniqueness of an idea

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,560
was also a lower bar today's

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,639
patent and trademark office in the u.s

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,320
which is the largest in the world

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,720
cannot hire enough qualified people to

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,160
do

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
real careful analysis of the uniqueness

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
of

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,839
what's being submitted so a lot more

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,040
patents are being granted without

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,720
deep um observation d

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,760
you know deep analysis and as a result

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,839
in patent court something like a third

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,360
of patents are actually being upheld

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
the other two thirds are being struck

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,680
down because they're bogus

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,360
and that's especially happening around

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,639
business method patents because the

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,959
other trend is

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
there are very few foundational patents

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,959
being filed now

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
it's mostly business method patents so

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,199
the difference there a foundational

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
patent

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,320
is a unique invention it's not just a

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,399
change in the way that you do things

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,240
and a business method patent is is a

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,000
change in the way you do things

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,199
so amazon owns a patent for something

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,199
called one click the idea that a company

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,120
could invent

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,360
a single click gets you the answer that

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,519
you need is ridiculous

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,600
right um there are a lot of other

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,000
patents like that that are ridiculous

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
and when

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,680
that patent was filed tim o'reilly of

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,399
o'reilly publishing

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,399
wrote a blog saying this is ridiculous

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,240
and jeff bezos answered him

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,800
so a long time ago jeff used to do his

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,199
own mail and he said

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
um dude i have to do this because my

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,040
investors want me to

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,720
stockpile value and this is the way to

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,040
do that but i agree with you that it's

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,320
broken so let's go to washington

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,079
so they went to washington together and

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,800
tim who's a friend of mine came back

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,680
from that meeting really depressed

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,560
in a week they were in 50 lawmaker

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
offices

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,959
this was during the bush administration

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,360
george w bush administration

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,839
they were in 50 different offices they

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
saw two working computers on lawmakers

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,279
offices

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,279
and they thought oh my god the problem

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,839
here is that everybody in power is too

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,680
old

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,959
to get what we're talking about so

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,680
nothing's gonna change

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,440
tim was like it's never gonna change and

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,000
then obama got elected

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,480
and there was a sea change in washington

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,560
people

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,000
from silicon valley moved into

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,160
d.c to help out as fast as they could

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
obama hired the first cto the country

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
had ever had

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,120
think about that it is a huge percentage

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
of our gdp

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,800
in america and yet there had never been

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
a technical person sitting in the white

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
house

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,920
but now there was however the patent

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,480
system has pro

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,560
has continued to be difficult to change

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,519
because they literally can't hire the

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
expertise

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,519
anybody who's good enough to be a patent

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,800
examiner is not going to work for civil

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,959
service wages

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,000
they're off working for the big tech

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
companies

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,959
so it's a broken system this is not how

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,240
to get roi out of your software

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,079
anymore it's a it's a serious long shot

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,800
unless you're doing foundational patents

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,160
and nobody's doing those in europe

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,880
business method patents aren't even

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,279
acceptable yet so

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,399
clinging to your ip's a bad idea what

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,000
makes more sense

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,519
is building your business i mean go

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,079
ahead and make ip

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,000
patent it if you must but don't hesitate

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,160
to open source your code if it gives

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,720
you a different advantage and some of

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,040
those advantages might include you get

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,240
more customers out of it the last two

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,120
really big

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,639
sales of open source companies have been

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,160
that the inflated values of those

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,799
companies came out of their

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,640
install base or their customer base or

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,520
their expertise in a specific

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,360
open source method so though that's

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,959
where your roi lives now

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,120
so you know don't be fooled by the

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
old-fashioned ways

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,760
all right then there's people whose

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,360
proprietary partners

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,720
don't like open source and they're

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,919
afraid that if they do it they're going

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
to get in trouble

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,000
this is another microsoft thing that

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,480
happened they they had the entire

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,760
subcontinent of india terrified of using

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,120
open source because

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,799
they were going to pull their funding

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
from the educational system if that

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,080
happened

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,720
this is you know up to about 15 years

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,640
ago

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
and then satya nadel shows up and all of

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,960
a sudden it's cool to do open source in

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,280
india

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,799
and they dove right in now they've got

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
laws on the books about

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,799
public code being uh you know stuff

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,799
that's paid for with taxpayer dollars

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,640
has to be open sourced in india now

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,320
um it's they're working on curricula to

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,360
teach it in schools i mean

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,480
it's they've made a big leap this uh

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,679
picture by the way

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,280
is from the week in night in

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,880
uh 2000 when ibm decided that they were

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,799
going to make public the fact that they

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,960
were making a big bet on linux

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,919
and they stenciled this design all over

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
the sidewalks

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,280
around this conference they were talking

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,360
at in san francisco

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,360
but they had neglected to get a proper

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
permit for this piece of street art and

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,200
they got

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,600
fined a lot of money for doing it

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,520
so people have bled real money for their

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
love of open source and big companies

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
have been doing it a long time

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,440
at this point it's table stakes and if

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
the company you're working with doesn't

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,000
like it

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,400
you probably need to dump them all right

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
then there's concern again this is more

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,039
of the unwashed masses thing

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,919
about how uncertain ship dates and

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,799
future

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,600
shipping is you can't plan around it the

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,600
future is

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,480
it's uncertain which is why you have a

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,480
climate change

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,880
beach shack there so here's the truth

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,400
about this one

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,760
most projects if anything ship too often

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,919
for you

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,960
so we have for many years now been

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,760
advocating

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,520
a pattern where they create a very

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,039
stable repository

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,120
that only once a year maybe they move

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,440
you know they do they port fixes to it

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,280
but pretty much it just stays the same

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
for a longer period of time

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,720
they put all of the new development into

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
a dev release

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,400
which means that your engineers can be

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
testing the new features and integrating

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
to them before

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,600
the big stable release comes out for the

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
next version which should make your

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,160
conversions a little bit better and

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
you won't feel so pressured to um do the

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,679
latest thing

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,280
without knowing that you like it and

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,559
most of the big projects are working

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,200
that way now

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
so um i think that this is actually kind

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
of a

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
moot point again now you're going to get

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,520
a very quick

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,000
licensing primer because

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,760
licensing is confusing however you have

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,960
the advantage of being with finos which

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,440
means that your if you

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,400
release your code under you know their

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,159
auspices

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,760
you will be using the apache software

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,159
license version too

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,280
which is a great license but let's go

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,799
through it quickly

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,559
on the right hand side you have

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,559
proprietary it's just there's

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,000
because it's the anchor against which we

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,880
measure everything else

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,880
on the left the far left you have the

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,320
inheritance or viral licenses

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,880
they don't like that name viral very

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,120
much they're also called the copy left

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
licenses because they use copyright in

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
an interesting way

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,280
to make sure that the code is always

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,679
going to be available

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,200
and the famous one is the gpl or gnu

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,400
public license and then there's some

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,360
others we'll talk about again in a

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,240
second

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,760
now if you look next to proprietary just

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
to the left of proprietary you see

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
permissive

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,039
that's the center the most easy to

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,039
digest licenses i will tell you from

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,559
personal experience the most likely to

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,679
drive deep adoption

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,720
are the permissive licenses mit bsd and

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
apache

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,559
these i call these copy center licenses

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
both because they're in the center

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,840
between

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,360
proprietary and copy left but also

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,880
because you can just go down to the copy

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
center and make as many copies as you

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,919
want because

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,480
the licenses literally say just use our

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,320
software we're not going to sue you

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
the apache is the gold standard because

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,360
it does have language about both

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,440
trademark and ip treatment

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,200
so that's why everybody has gotten

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,799
around those two the other two are very

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,760
brief licenses but they are

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,159
all sort of the same conceptually and

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,200
then

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,039
the mozilla license is a hybrid license

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,520
meaning that it acts like a permissive

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,320
license until some condition is broken

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,159
and it changes to being a viral or

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,760
inheritance license

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
so it's sort of the best of both worlds

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
or at least it looked that way to a lot

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
of companies but it turns out to be a

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,799
bad idea

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,600
to use that license for everyday use

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,799
because it creates smaller pools of code

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,840
less reuse all of these licenses except

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,799
for the proprietary and the affero

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,280
trigger on distribution and since most

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,919
code is now presented to consumers

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,280
behind a sas wall as software as a

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,840
service wall so it's

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,280
being performed over a browser or over

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,000
an app

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,760
you're not actually shipping open source

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
code like the linux

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,880
operating system if you're using it in

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
your shop

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,640
it's not being shipped to the customer

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,200
so you're not actually triggering

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,120
any of the requirements that you open

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,640
your code along with them

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,559
so hopefully that gives you a little bit

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
of idea remember again none of this

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,480
matters if you're going with finos

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,320
they've already chosen the best license

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,720
all right and then the last one is that

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,640
community requires resources

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,280
and that more and more people tell me

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,159
they just don't have time to build that

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,080
but that is so misguided the community

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,280
is in fact the whole

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,280
value almost of open source i mean yes

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,200
it is cheaper to acquire

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,559
but the way that you pay for it is by

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,799
building community

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,640
because you know about the tragedy of

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,320
the commons where if you over graze the

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,039
commons the commons dies

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,919
right feeding back into the system is

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,400
how you pay

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,080
for the use of that software and you do

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
that by building community around the

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,679
stuff that you open source

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,159
or by participating in community when

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,880
you donate contributions upstream

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,159
this is very key and anybody who misses

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,679
this point is going to be

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,200
disappointed in their open source

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,559
engagements

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,960
all right so after listening to all of

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,799
that

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,320
if you plan to open source you might as

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,880
well make it effective

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,640
so i'm going to give you a very quick

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,279
version of how to do that

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,960
i decided a little while ago to help one

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,279
of my employees by giving them

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,240
a quick set of questions they could ask

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,000
to sort through

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,039
proposed open source projects to see

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,159
whether they were going to be a good

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,159
idea or not

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,000
before we wasted time on them so i'm

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,400
going to give them to you now

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,679
number one does anybody care aside from

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
you and your mom

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,039
this is a hard concept to grasp if you

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,320
think that you are going to be like

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,799
apple where you do these

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,960
events with the big reveal but the big

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,960
reveal is really costly

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,159
in terms of your ability to actually get

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,039
the work done

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,840
it's in my opinion an unwieldy and bad

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,320
idea in like

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,240
99.99 of cases and so

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,240
it's perfectly reasonable to send an

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
engineer to a meet-up like the ones that

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,919
james runs

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,120
have them pitch the idea of this being

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,440
open source

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
and not as a done deal but as a look how

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
clever we are we built this thing would

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
it be helpful to you guys if we open

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
source this

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,799
come and see me later at the end of the

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,960
show

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,840
and if nobody turns up that should tell

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,880
you something

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
don't bother okay there are hundreds of

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,520
thousands of projects

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,520
that have been open source that nobody

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,919
cares about you don't want your brand

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,279
associated with one of them

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,600
secondly are you still using it people

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,679
tend to want to dump code that they

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
don't want to support anymore

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,799
or that they have an engineer who worked

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,799
on it and got

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,240
loved it but now they need him to do

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,679
something else so they

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
they promise him that they'll open

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
source it but

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,279
he's going to want to work on that

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,120
instead of the new thing probably

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,880
unless he's actually leaving the company

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
and you want him to go ahead and start a

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,159
company with that stuff that he worked

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,080
on for you that you're not using

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,919
but in general if you're not using

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,880
whatever it is you don't want to open

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,039
source it

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,279
okay next are you still improving it

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,440
assuming that somebody cares you found

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,799
somebody and you're still using it

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
are you still improving it or do you

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,240
think it's perfect now

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
if you think it's perfect it's a bad

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,600
candidate for open source because you're

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
not going to be able to build community

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,480
if there

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,799
aren't things left to do people think

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
they have to polish the code to a fine

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,520
gloss

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,960
before they release it but that is the

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,720
wrong impetus

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,240
what you want to do is get in the habit

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,200
of writing good code

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,600
but also being honest within your code

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,080
so

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,640
it's okay to tag a given part of the

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,440
code this needs to be replaced

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,600
or another part this is a bit of a hack

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,919
but we were trying to redo it or

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,799
this is an area that you could help this

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,400
is all cool

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,400
because it leaves people points of

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,440
integration so

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,640
don't don't over polish and then the

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,799
last one

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,840
after you have submitted the thing as an

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,640
open source project

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
made your splash can there only be one

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,080
tree please can you

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,919
kill the version that you keep inside

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
the firewall that you work on

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,840
if you keep working on that inside the

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,240
firewall instead of working as a regular

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
community member out in the project

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,919
you are going to be tempted to throw

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,559
stuff over the wall once you've got it

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,520
polished up and that will also disincent

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,600
your community

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,000
horribly there have been some very

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
famous very heavily funded

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,159
open source projects by corporations

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,000
that died that way

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
notably the darwin project that apple

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,600
did when they switched to

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,679
um the mock kernel they got the best

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,960
possible person they set it up they gave

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,720
it a lot of air space

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,640
but they could not break themselves of

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,360
the habit of building stuff inside the

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
firewall

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,039
and then catapulting it over the wall

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,000
don't do it

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,000
okay and now for questions

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,000
thank you very much denise um we do have

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,840
a few minutes um

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,919
for anybody who has a question but

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,320
before we go over to questions i'd like

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,480
to

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,960
announce the winners of the finnos

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
t-shirts um that we will be shipping to

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,080
you

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,320
so the first person who has been picked

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,320
at random is alexander phillips

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,520
from capital one congratulations

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
alexander

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
and the second person is ken long from

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
jpmorgan

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,200
um who incidentally both of those firms

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,279
are finos members

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,520
so thank you very much for attending and

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,279
being here today

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,960
and thanks for the the round of applause

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,120
denise um

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
so okay normally i actually ask um

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
people if they can

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,240
drop their questions in the chat but um

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
if there's anybody on the line who would

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,080
like to come off mute

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,640
feel free to come off mute and ask your

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,640
ask your questions to denise directly

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,120
hey james this is rob your colleague how

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,760
are you

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,720
hi bro i'm very well thank you i just

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,039
wanted to say

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,399
as always great job really wonderful

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,760
presentation and i just wanted to

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,559
highlight that last point

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,320
of no catapulting from so many good

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,960
nuggets in the presentation

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,480
i think that's probably my favorite um

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,480
that catapulting thing really

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,520
truly authentically working in the open

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,039
is

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
and really doing your builds and really

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
doing your commits and full requests to

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,520
the public repository and not

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,039
catapulting is perhaps the most

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,559
important thing

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,480
i know as we're going through the alloy

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,480
project that's one of the things that

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
um our member goldman sachs is really

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,720
committed to is

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,320
as it opens sorts of open sources alloy

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,520
really working hard to make sure that

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,399
the open source code is going to be the

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,919
um de facto and uh public version that

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,200
it's going to be doing its builds on

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,039
and that's a commitment that a bunch of

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
our members have made as they've open

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,520
source so i just wanted to highlight

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,679
that it's a really

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,120
yeah that's a great practice that's a

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,039
that's a really great practice

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,559
because it's not open source otherwise

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,480
we used to call that

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,760
i said catapulting we used to call it

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,440
tarball flinging

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,760
but people don't know what a tarball is

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
anymore

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,559
you know say hi and maybe you know pass

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,840

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,840
feel free to do so

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,159
gosh james maybe i answered all the

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,720
questions it'd be great

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,880
now hello oh hey

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,480
nice to meet you uh i'm georgia riedel

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,760
from banking sdk

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
uh i just have a small question maybe

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,840
which is uh oh what's the best way to to

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,600
build a community

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,880
around an open source project

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,679
well the main thing is that you have to

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
put yourself

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,320
in the shoes of a contributor that isn't

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,640
working for you or with you

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
and you have to bend over way backwards

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,520
to make sure

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,840
that those contributors have an easy

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,640
ramp to get involved

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,000
open source works based on enlightened

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,520
self-interest

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,240
so you have to be giving people an an

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,919
intrinsic good feeling about

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,679
contributing to your project

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,960
right and um so making it easy

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,640
making it fun making it uh

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,200
making them feel accomplished for

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,240
getting it done these are all good ideas

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,919
there's some famous projects like drupal

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,080
for instance which is a content

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,880
management system quite a large one

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
that every time they get together they

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,480
have

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,240
what's called a public check-in

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,679
where they randomly pick somebody from

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,799
their hackathon who's done an

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,840
interesting

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,720
piece of work and they publicly do the

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,840
code review

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,399
that is required before it's merged so

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,960
that poor person is standing there

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,679
while one of the main people from the

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,600
project

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,000
reads their code but they're doing it in

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,679
the most celebratory

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,519
way because they've pre-checked it to

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,840
make sure it's probably going to be okay

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,600
right and at the moment that they merge

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,440
it everybody in the and they'll have an

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
auditorium full of 500 people watching

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,640
this

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,360
everybody claps and that community

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,440
member is

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
instantly hooked they want to do it

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,640
again

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,399
so finding ways to celebrate the

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,480
contributions that come your way

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,159
is worth doing it doesn't have to be

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,240
that homegrown

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,279
um it can there's there's lots of ways

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,880
to do it

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,080
but uh the art of managing communities

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
what we used to call community

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,960
management

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,000
i prefer community gardening now because

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,519
it's a little bit more like

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,440
that um is

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,039
about 20 years old now we're getting

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,880
pretty good at it and there are some

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,919
good books about how to do it

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,200
my friend john o'bacon wrote a book 10

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
years ago now called the art of

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
community that's pretty good

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,679
um and then he just recently wrote

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,399
another book about how you can use that

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,399
community

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,840
to do amazing things for your brand and
