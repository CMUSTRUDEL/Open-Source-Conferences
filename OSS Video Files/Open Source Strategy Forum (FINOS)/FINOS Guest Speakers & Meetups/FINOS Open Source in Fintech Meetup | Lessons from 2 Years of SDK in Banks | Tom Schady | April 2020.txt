okay

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,560
so um it's now 4 p.m in the uk

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,600
and 11 a.m eastern time in the u.s

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,080
um i'd like to welcome everybody to

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
the finos virtual meetup this afternoon

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800
and this morning

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,559
um this is actually our our second um

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,760
virtual meetup the first of which was

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,079
last week

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
um and i'm very happy to see everybody

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:44,160
joining the cool this afternoon

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:48,160
um our aim aims at finos are to hold um

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,879
a virtual meet-up hopefully

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
as often as we can with vacations and

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,879
also

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,760
schedules permitting so far we've

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,000
been able to do that each wednesday and

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,719
so

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
we'll see how we can um see whether we

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
can keep that going forward

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,360
um moving on um whether we can

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,119
do that around our own holidays and you

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
know around all of the various different

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
breaks that we have across

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,040
all of our different time zones etc um

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
but it's brilliant to be able to invite

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,920
people who are

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,080
both part of the um finos

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,960
community and also people who are new to

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,840
finos

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,720
um into this school so we can all say hi

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
and welcome

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,280

the lead of our um our voice um

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,680
project um into the cool this afternoon

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,600
um for a talk on seven unexpected

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
lessons from two years of rsc

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,159
sdk in banks and so tom welcome to the

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
call this afternoon um

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,560
if i can hand the call over to you

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,960
great thank you james and good day

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
everyone

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
my name is tom shady i'm the cto of

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,840
greenkey technologies

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,200
we are a fintech startup focusing on

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,920
nlp for the financial industry

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,360
what that means is we can take in

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,800
unstructured voice

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,800
and chat data turned into

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,520
structured communication and

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
their power men downstream workflows so

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,840
in today's talk

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,480
the goal for me is is to help people

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,400
understand some of the common and

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
uncommon frictions

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
that we've experienced through getting

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
our open source sdk

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
adopted by banks so that you can

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,160
accelerate usage

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,360
in your own firms for whatever open

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,120
source project you'd like to

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
so i'm going to present some background

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
on our sdk what it does

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,360
what the what our engine does just so

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,280
you can get some context for

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,480
these lessons i'm going to get right

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,440
into

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
seven lessons we've learned some hard

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,319
one

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,319
over the last two years

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,519
and try and present some of the

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,920
mitigations

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
and solutions that we've done for these

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,400
uh

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,200
again just to so you can avoid some of

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,879
these problems yourself or accelerate

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
all right and then lastly i'm going to

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,480
mention some resources

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,239
not only to help contribute to uh

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,879
finos projects and the green key sdk but

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,239
uh how to accelerate open source usage

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,680
in your firms through some of the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,879
excellent finance programs that exist

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
so without further ado get right into a

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,599
description

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
of our engine so the sdk is a software

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,400
development kit

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,439
that sits on top of an api

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,319
behind which is our nlp engine and what

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,840
this does is

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,120
is captured most efficiently in this

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
slide here so

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
we take this unstructured inquiry and i

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
get a price

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,799
uh and the product mentioned and the

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,599
price and and all the uh

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,720
various detail and we take that

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,799
unstructured text

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
and turn it into the below json so this

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,199
is a

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,280
once quick snapshot on what we can do

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
and then of course json is the lingua

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,560
franca for

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,080
inter operation these days you can power

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,080
many downstream

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,040
uh products and and uh

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
reports from this so what is our

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
greenkey

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,520
discovery sdk

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,840
it allows you your firm to create your

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,400
own custom rules and definitions to help

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,240
power this nlp

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,400
the rest so it takes transcription in

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
you determine the intent which you can

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,280
think of as

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,440
like a command or a verb

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,639
and we search for all the relevant

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
entities in that

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
expression an entity you can consider

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,840
loosely

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,759
an object or a noun our algorithm

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
uh which is one of the my favorite parts

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,840
of

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,919
of green key allows you to choose the

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
best set of all these possibilities or

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
or the engine automatically does that

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
for you

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
and then of course we populate the json

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
as you saw before

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,639
so what's an example of this this is

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,440
sometimes called the nlp

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
uh intense lot filling as an example

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
let's say

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,320
you say open google chrome open

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,520
the intent chrome is the

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,960
entity but where this gets complex is

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
google could be an entity

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
or chrome could be an entity and so what

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,840
our engine does is it figures out the

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,759
best

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,639
combination in this case google chrome

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,479
is is what you meant

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,759
and we learned this over time so what do

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,280
we do

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,680
with these results uh this feeds into

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,479
why we need the sdk so we generate a lot

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,039
of reports

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
right now there's several examples here

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
we find

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,039
all mentions of a product and email

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,240
voice and chat

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,319
this allows you to miss fewer

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
opportunities you can create an audit

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,000
trail you can analyze a vast amount of

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,600
uh content in minutes and speed customer

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,639
interaction and ultimately we want to

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
drive trades

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,919
so this is uh this is the motivation

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,319
for for a bank to to pick up our sdk

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,400
and the reason they want to do so is

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
there's always some custom extensions so

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,160
the motivation for us offering an open

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,280
source sdk for

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,199
uh through finos is you know we provide

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,960
a very good base level engine

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,880
but for people who want to customize it

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,319
further maybe they have very specific

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,240
things for their firm we thought

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
allowing them the power of an open

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,639
source sdk on top

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160
you can really customize it uh and and

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,440
tailor it specifically

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,639
to your needs so uh you know if you're

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,840
interested in that there's

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,720
an email below uh so james if

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
you can relax my sales pitch is over now

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
uh

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,000
so what what we do here

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,919
for this presentation i'm going to be

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
talking about

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
our experiences from a startup

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,800
perspective

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,440
but all partnerships are two-way

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,360
so it's good for both sides to be aware

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,400
of the problems that you may

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,639
experience uh this is really

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,440
down to an impedance mismatch there's a

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,360
fundamental

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,000
frequency difference between a startup

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,720
and a bank

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,639
you know there's opposition to certain

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,039
information that comes in just

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,160
organizationally we operate a certain

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,800
way banks operate very differently

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,960
and so lessons although they'll be from

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
my perspective as a startup

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,479
you could easily see the you know bank

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,840
for those

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,240
calling in from banking institutions

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
uh you can see the kind of problems that

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
both sides have

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,840
so without further ado let me get into

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
the first one

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,240
assume hub accessibility so these are

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,919
going to be pretty specific

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,599
um but i'm going to show through some

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,440
examples here so

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,960
this is a sample conversation that we

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960
would have the customer

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
allow you to read that for a moment

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,400
and the left here is that don't assume

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,840
even if someone says they have access it

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
may not be full access

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,839
this was a big surprise to us when

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
somebody says yeah we can access github

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,800
okay cool listen all these things oh no

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,039
we're restricted in the specifics of how

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,000
we do that we can't use ssh we can't

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,760
hit certain endpoints uh and so this

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
this was a big shocker

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,839
uh you know most open source people

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,000
collaborate around github or gitlab or

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,920
some centralized

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,120
code repository and so this

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,680
took some doing fortunately

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,800
its origins began with email-based

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,080
workflows

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,920
uh in the 90s so

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
you know there's a long history of and

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,279
tooling for for

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,279
you to collaborate over email but this

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,720
is something that that we wanted to

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,440
get up front how are we going to

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
collaborate um what are the restrictions

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,560
you'll see this is a

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,240
common theme throughout a lot of these

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,320
and that's that communication solves a

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,360
lot of problems

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,760
number two don't assume familiarity with

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,839
tools that you take for granted

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,680
so our banking customers are not us

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,279
this is not a typical open source

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
community if you're offering open source

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,560
software

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,920
to a financial institution you can't

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,480
assume some of the things that you might

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
for things in you know the apache

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,920
foundation for instance

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,080
so some tools are pretty well known uh

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,519
pip and pm amongst the generally no

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,079
problems with those

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
but one thing that really surprised us

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
is people who are not familiar with

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,120
docker we've been using it for years

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,880
it's kind of second nature for us so the

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,079
docker command line was

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,440
was a challenge uh some of our customers

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,839
are microsoft shops

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
um i know there's a microsoft open

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
source community as well

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
we're not familiar with that you know

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,399
we're we're linux based

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,680
so just the standard unix command lines

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,680
uh tools it was surprising the the level

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,000
of um difference in

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,880
understanding there and even bash

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,279
scripts which

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,200
you know we we would supply uh on a

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
regular basis there was some difficulty

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
there so

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,160
we have a lot of windows users and our

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,800
clients even windows development

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,079
uh and this is just not something to

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,320
take for granted

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,120
uh and so asking a lot of questions up

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
front

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
uh being very explicit uh providing

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,399
really good readme they're all

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:04,720
good solutions for this um the next one

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,720
all right this is something we hoped for

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,079
we shouldn't assume people are going to

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,800
want to tinker with your product

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,000
what i mean by that is even if there's

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,480
an open source project

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
that's interesting you can download it

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
play with it

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,560
do some experimentation something we're

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,519
looking for

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,200
that's not what happened so you know our

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,519
customers either ignore us

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
do a quick hello world and then ignore

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
us

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
or the ones that are successful have a

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,279
mandate to drive this in a schedule so

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,399
that's something we

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:45,040
we address up front

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:48,399
this is a mutually beneficial financial

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,680
partnership we don't want

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,040
to waste our time or our customers time

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,959
so right up front it's what's the

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880
project plan we have this open source

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,440
software who's going to be working on it

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,880
and what's their mandate time kills

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
deals and it's just important to

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,399
accelerate things

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,959
by getting behind up front so this one

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,240
was

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:18,079
uh is constantly surprising

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,920
assume every possible restriction

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,800
in the company we have some examples

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
here there's some standard ones where

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
you know

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,920
ports for lockdown protocols file

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,399
permissions are very restricted

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,040
the developer laptops may exist in some

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,279
kind of

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,480
limbo between production and something

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
open

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,560
uh one of the surprising things we had

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
was that admin access time is limited to

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
20 minutes

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
at one customer with a lot of machine

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,720
learning libraries and they take quite a

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,760
long time to install a very large

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,800
it takes more than 20 so minutes to

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,120
process was quite long

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,240
we had to bring our installer up into 20

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
minutes

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
so this customer could could install it

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,279
correctly given their

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,399
20 minute window for admin time for root

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
access

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
so this is something that was pretty

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,720
surprising

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,279
now how do you possibly address all of

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
these

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,360
things that might go wrong i came from

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,639
medical devices years ago there's

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
something that

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,399
just came out of the military fmea is a

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,680
process called failure mode effects

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,200
analysis

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,120
basically assume that everything is

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
going to fail assume everything will go

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
wrong

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,760
throughout your software throughout your

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
communication throughout your stack

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,440
how is this going to go wrong and what

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
are the consequences of it

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,959
okay so the install script is going to

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,079
fail how okay that you know

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,720
all right going through painstaking

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,720
detail

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
on every single component and how it's

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,920
going to fail from a communication

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,519
from a permission perspective doing all

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
this upfront will save you

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,360
a ton of time and grief for our

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,600
customers and an interesting

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,560
technique we like to use is reverse

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,480
brainstorming it's one of my favorites

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,720
that's where you imagine the uh

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
have the opposite goal and decide how

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,800
you would achieve that

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,880
so how would we make sure if i'm a bank

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,720
that we can never deploy software

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
and go through all the possibilities of

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
that okay let's make sure that no one

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
has any file permissions

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,240
let's make sure that admin access is

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,360
five seconds long

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
uh let's have all ports blocked

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,639
and then when you reverse that you

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,920
sometimes come up with

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,920
interesting solutions for these

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,959
number five do provide advanced

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,959
tutorials

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
this helps with this is a good

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,040
mitigation to help with a couple of the

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,720
problems that we have elsewhere

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,519
we need to be extremely explicit

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,800
and it helps with the familiarities with

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
tools that's our number two

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,240
surprise don't assume people

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
know bash commands don't assume people

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,399
know

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,399
uh docker commands don't assume anything

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
type out every single command that was

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,199
necessary to get your

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,959
things installed you'll see this with

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,480
some larger open source projects to kind

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,920
of skip some steps

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,959
because they assume a certain level of

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,959
knowledge assume nothing

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,320
the one metric we used to use was time

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,480
the first hello world that's ttfhw

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
it's it's a good metric for an sdks how

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
long does it take someone to get a quick

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,160
example up and running

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,639
complex i found that wasn't enough

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,079
so we had to continue and it's how long

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,639
does it take someone to go through the

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,639
advanced

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,160
tutorial hello world for those not

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,000
familiar is

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,160
uh a primordial expression for

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
how what's the simplest possible program

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,079
and that's one that you just print hello

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,720
world on your screen

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,040
and there's a lot that happens for that

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
to occur so what's the simplest possible

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,000
use of our sdk

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,440
let's get that and let's let's measure

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
that but it actually

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,240
the advanced um the advanced case was

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,040
was more important

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
a huge benefit of this is doing an

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,839
extreme advanced tutorial you actually

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,399
uncover

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,399
a lot of restrictions in a firm so

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,639
by someone executing this tutorial very

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,120
early you

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,639
know what their access restrictions are

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
you know what some of the developer

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
laptop

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,880
uh restrictions are it saved a ton of

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,000
time for us

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,440
so you know it's not quite

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,040
you know build something for your

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,680
production example but it's close

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,399
and it allows you to find all the early

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,240
which saves

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,560
a ton of time here's one that uh

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
that surprised me so this this has

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,320
happened that

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,320
um i i hate to say it too firm so i

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,279
didn't learn my lesson the first time

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
but it's yeah we're almost ready to go

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,560
have you met our ciso

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,079
uh our customers are large organizations

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,160
separate departments feel like separate

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,160
companies

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,559
and it's very difficult to understand

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,600
how to navigate the full

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,199
path of your of your firm and if you can

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,000
find someone that knows that they're

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,039
worth their weight in gold for you

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,360
and so what we've had to do is when we

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,480
engage one team we actually reach out

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,319
proactively say

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
okay let's who's the infrastructure

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,520
content here

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
who's your security officer what's your

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,640
security team if you're doing a

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,600
cloud-based product it's what cloud team

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,480
do you have

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
so we don't wait for our customers to

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
drive that

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
project we reach out and do it ahead of

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,320
time so you as a startup

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,000
you may need to drive this the last

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,640
thing you want to do is get everything

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,400
in place and then do a full stop because

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,000
some important business unit was not

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,400
considered the lesson here is that

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,600
you know organizations are huge and

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
complex

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,200
you can't always count on them to be to

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
know how

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,039
all the check boxes that they're going

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
to need ahead of time so just reach out

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:11,360
and proactively do this

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,400
the last one sounds like a catch-all but

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,720
it's uh it's good guys for us really

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
don't assume anything

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,559
this has happened to us too great

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,280
everything's in place

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,160
can you run it on red hat six so for

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,840
those that don't know

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,320
it's a ten year old operating system

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,640
which is

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,080
40 years old for a startup you know

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,039
startup years practically

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,160
it's just it's ancient and so weird

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,679
blockers come up

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,720
at the last minute how do you handle

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,240
unknown unknowns

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,120
of course it's it's impossible but

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
you can do your best by really asking

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,799
questions

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
all the time hunt down risks find

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,440
miscommunications

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,440
what do you mean by that word

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,679
it's it's critical to get to speak the

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,120
same language and you probably don't so

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,120
ask a lot of questions

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,880
all the time think ahead what might go

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,000
wrong um

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,000
and lastly expect there to be a surprise

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
you have to plan for curveballs you have

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,280
to leave room in a project plan for

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,400
unknown unknowns because there will be

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
in every single one

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
and so in summary

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,440
here's the lift you know

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,280
don't assume tools

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,799
you take for granted don't assume the

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,320
same knowledge

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,160
don't assume that people are going to be

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
interested in playing with your software

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,320
they're

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,840
there for a professional reason only

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
you have to assume every possible

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,080
restriction

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,400
a lot of these problems through very

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,960
advanced step-by-step tutorials

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,919
get ahead on a communication problem

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,440
lastly

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,200
plan for curveballs i detected the

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,600
contradiction in these rules

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
but you know the world's messy it

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,000
doesn't always boil down into seven

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,760
simple

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,960
principles so before we get into any

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,000
questions

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,440
just like to remind people that there

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,200
are many ways to contribute

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,200
fenus is a great organization we're

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
happy to be a member

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
there's many repositories inside finos

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
that you can look at on github there's a

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,840
repository link

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,520
a program that i i very much enjoy that

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,880
actually is designed to solve a lot of

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
the problems i brought up today the

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,840
financial delivery accelerator

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,039
fdx there's a group called osr

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,640
inside it which is open source readiness

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,960
i believe there was a call there this

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,799

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
mentioned today

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,520
second one is a standalone project to

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,000

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,120
so please take a look at those take a

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
look at finos

a

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,120
um something that i'd like to say is

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
this afternoon we will be giving away

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
two

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,799
um free finnos t-shirts um at random to

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,919
people who have registered in advance

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,559
for the call

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
um so grizz in the background is um

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,640
currently getting the

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
um random number generator uh warmed up

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,120
to pull those names

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
um and also just to remind people that

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,039
um

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,799
we do have uh the finnos page

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,840
um on linkedin and we also have a

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,240
twitter account and we've also got

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,080
github.com

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,320
which um grizz has actually put in the

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,919
chat um if people want to follow

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,280
those links and find us um so okay so

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,640
tom i guess now

00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,320
uh you're ready to to move into um a q a

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,080
so if anybody's got any questions

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,840
in fact actually i've got one coming

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,200
through or there is one

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,240
in chat from emerging tech ny

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,559
um which is what was the

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
motivation to open source through finnos

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,760
instead of other foundations or even

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,919
maintaining it yourself

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,360
so that one is actually quite an honest

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
question so

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
tom are you are you happy to answer that

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,799
yeah

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,280
sure i'm happy to answer anything uh so

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,080
we do maintain it ourselves inside finos

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,320
first of all

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,360
um you know finos is an organization

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,200
providing a lot of resources for us

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
that we thought was a best fit for this

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,080
but you know we

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,880
are actively making pull requests

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
and our team every day is improving the

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
sdk

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,840
so so we certainly maintain it and you

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
know we we do accept outside

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,640
contributions as well

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,320
uh subject venus rules of course

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,159
finance was a great organization because

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,679
there's such a focus on

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,600
finance and all of our customers and

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,039
potential customers

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,880
many of them are members

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,760
we share the same interest in

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,840
helping out with all of the frictions

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,600
and interoperability between this

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,960
this whole platform and we think that

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,799
vanessa's the best

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,799
poise to to help everyone

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,799
that's amazing specifically from

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
financial institutions

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,280
absolutely um and we also have a

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,159
question from mohit

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,400
um who asks how do you suggest to start

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,039
a core banking software with open source

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
tech stack

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
wow

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,600
each each bank is going to be very

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,400
different i think

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,360
i mean there's there's a variety of of

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
open source

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,200
stacks to to start with i mean that's a

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,880
tough one to answer

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,320
i i think you should choose the right

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,159
tools for the job i

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,440
hate to give you that answer but it

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,640
depends

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,760
um can i give a different angle to that

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,039
same question

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,799
um say tommy in your experience would

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,279
you

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,200
go to the tech stack first you know in

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,679
order to solve your problems with your

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
team

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,480
or would you um go out to the vent to

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240
the to the banks to ask them what level

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,799
of open source they will accept

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,799
before you architect your solution ah i

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,000
see what you're saying

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,760
so from from that angle um yeah i mean

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,600
there's there's no point in offering

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,039
something customers don't want

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,159
uh you know we we obtain you know on our

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,760
engine side

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,799
we uh we build that with best of breed

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,640
that

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,279
that's a close-sourced solution so

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,480
whatever is best for us there

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,120
but absolutely so we interview people we

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,799
ask them uh we thought about who's going

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,480
to be using this you know at first it

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,919
was you know our first iteration we

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
thought data scientists would be doing

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,200
this

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,919
uh and so you know python was was an

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,320
interface

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,320
then we realized that we could be that

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,400
data scientist for you

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,600
and so just simple config files um

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,880
yaml is all that's necessary to to drive

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,360
the green key discovery sdk so

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
uh you know you you definitely have to

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,320
interview people

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,919
understand what they can use and what

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,640
they can't they're certain they're very

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,480
popular

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,440
and node seems to have caught on

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,120
certainly python is in most places

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,400
um and is totally acceptable

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,120
um now where it gets trickier

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,960
things like docker kubernetes this is

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
what we deploy on so when we go on

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,120
premise

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,000
we found some some obstacles there

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,679
uh but for a small company we thought

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,240
that was worth the risk it lets us

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,559
deploy in our cloud with the same stack

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,679
as

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,440
an on-prem solution we we do you're

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,120
right in that we do spend considerable

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,039
time educating

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,200
helping our customers get through that

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,320
process sometimes helping them

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,080
get approval to to use those tools so

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,520
that's a conscious choice we made you

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,240
just have to ask a lot of questions your

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,400
customers

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
and tell your solution

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,400
that's brilliant um okay so very hits

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,640
coming in uh with an

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,520
another line saying i guess online banks

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
like monze

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,760
are using certain open source tech

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,919
stacks um which is absolutely right so

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,279
right here i know on first hand that

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,360
monzo um are um so

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,320
they actually came into a meet-up that i

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,799
run in london

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,760
um and gave a demonstration of graphql

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,080
um

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
but i guess you know they've had the

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,240
opportunity to architect their platform

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
from the ground upwards

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,600
whereas um a lot of startups are

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,840
actually you know

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,679
supplying software into banks where that

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
architecture's been around for quite a

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,080
while

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,520
um okay tom so another question for you

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
if it's okay and this one's actually

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,440
from me

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,440
um so within your your presentation you

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,720
gave some great examples of where you

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,960
kind of hit blockers

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,000
um as you start introducing your

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
software

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,640
um and more people get introduced into

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,679
the product team

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,000
um do you probably at the wrong time as

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,320
well

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,480
so like about to go live and then see so

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,159
kind of like it introduced which um i've

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,440
also seen before

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,440
do you have any examples where a bank is

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,760
kind of changed and maybe you get all of

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,039
those people

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,120
around the table in advance or

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,240
have you had the chance to influence who

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,559
those people should be

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,039
in advance of your project or your

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:53,039
introduction to that bank starting

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:56,480
i mean we try uh you know

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,080
we focus on learning from our mistakes

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,679
each time we interact with the customers

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,399
a chance to get better and so we have

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
checklists

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,240
project plans our success team is

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,399
measured by how fast they can

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,960
onboard and get to production and so we

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,559
you know we look for those opportunities

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,720
uh

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,720
it's hard because we you know sometimes

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,080
an organization is a huge black box to

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,440
us and so

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,799
you know we may have a handful of

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,799
contacts we just do our best

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,279
generally speaking there's a fairly

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,799
standard patterns that people follow you

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,799
know there's an infrastructure team

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
you have to get on their their backlog

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,440
you have to get them to

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,880
help deploy it if it's an on-premise

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,880
solution um

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,399
yeah every time it's

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,240
there's no cookie cutter solution

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,919
unfortunately

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,120
so in retrospective if this was like a

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,360
an actual retrospective you know kind of

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
session is there any advice that you

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,320
would give to the

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,240
to the bigger banks about how they can

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,440
be you know more inclusive

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,760
of you know startups and fintechs who do

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,880
have

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,080
innovative solutions um but maybe their

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,720
current setup

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,159
both in terms of org design and in terms

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,080
of architecture

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,440
is limited limiting that engagement

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,960
sure yeah i think

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,440
whether it's your job or not it's

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,640
important to get a 50 000 foot view

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
of things i know that

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,880
you know if you're an implementer or

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,880
tasked with something specific

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,200
you know your nose is to the grindstone

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,000
you have a six inch view of things

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,559
but uh someone on the project and maybe

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,799
that's

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,080
you needs to take a step back and say

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,679
okay what what is

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,520
what are the potential blockers here for

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,679
this what can go wrong

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,399
um i think it's just foresight

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,120
you know this so surprised could have

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,120
been foreseen

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,279
you know by our customers that you know

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
the second time it was definitely

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,640
you know that was on us and we can

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,000
foresee that but

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,919
uh it's important to make sure someone

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,080
on the project can can work

00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,000
inter-departmentally

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,360
and knows about all these connections

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,640
you just need that person that

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,000
understands the

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,039
the flow of your politics

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,080
of your approval process

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,960
so we we agree as a startup we

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,159
really seek that person out uh do you

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
understand how the different departments

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,440
work together okay

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,399
no who who does who can we talk to let's

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,679
get them

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,760
let's get them on this call let's get

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,159
them on this project so

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,240
all right that's um that's brilliant

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,919
um so i'm actually looking in our chat

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,640
we've um got a bit of a

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,159
conversation starting from trey um he's

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,600
um replying to rohit

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,760
um it's it's really good to see

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,799
everybody engaging um and thank you

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,279
about the

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,320
uh fraught mounting monitoring question

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,720
as well

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,559
um so if there's um any questions that

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,320
people have about finos

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,000
um or if people want to get in contact

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,640
with me you know after

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,519
this webinar feel free to email me at

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,519
james

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,039
phillips.org and we can continue the

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,399
conversation

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,919
um so okay so we're on

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:23,279
at 4 30 uh in the uk um

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,320
and 11 30 eastern time in the u.s

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,679
um does anybody have any additional

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,000
questions

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,640
um actually one's just come in for trey

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,799
so trey you're asking about um a finnos

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,120
um slack uh question so

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,919
and mike you're replying to that so at

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,720
the moment

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,360
uh finos doesn't have a slack channel um

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,760
but we do

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,640
have um a number of working group calls

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,840
that people can

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,960
um join uh in order to continue

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,399
the conversation around our projects um

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
the reason that we don't have a slack

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,960
channel

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,559
is because we actually uh communicate

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,120
using symphony

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,559
which is supplied um for the regulated

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,559
banking industry

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,480
um and that's all part of you know the

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,960
the offering that philos actually

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,000
um has it's about being able to

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,480
communicate across

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,799
a regulated industry without being seen

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,360
to you know influence within that area

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,120
and so we have certain kind of um
