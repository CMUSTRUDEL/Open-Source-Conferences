Description: 
	STEPHEN DIEHL // CTO // ADJOINT
In this presentation, Stephen introduces Adjoint's approach and motivations for open-sourcing. He covers the technical, cultural and commercial benefits for the company, its staff, partners and clients. He also talks about how to build commercial products using open-source technology components and Open Banking APIs; and how this brings digitisation, speed, efficiency and controls to financial operations in ways that were hitherto infeasible.
