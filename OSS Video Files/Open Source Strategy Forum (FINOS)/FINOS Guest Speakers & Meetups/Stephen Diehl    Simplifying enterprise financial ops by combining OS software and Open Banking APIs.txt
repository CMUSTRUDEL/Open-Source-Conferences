Title: Stephen Diehl    Simplifying enterprise financial ops by combining OS software and Open Banking APIs
Publication date: 2021-01-08
Playlist: FINOS Guest Speakers & Meetups
Description: 
	STEPHEN DIEHL // CTO // ADJOINT
In this presentation, Stephen introduces Adjoint's approach and motivations for open-sourcing. He covers the technical, cultural and commercial benefits for the company, its staff, partners and clients. He also talks about how to build commercial products using open-source technology components and Open Banking APIs; and how this brings digitisation, speed, efficiency and controls to financial operations in ways that were hitherto infeasible.
 
The London Open Source Fintech Meetup is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).

okay so I'm Stephen and I'm just

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,970
speaking about open banking and open

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,110
source FinTech so I think it's actually

00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,670
really good that I actually followed

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,699
Adam because I'm represent sort of the

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,500
dual side to him so I worked for a fin

00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:20,539
tech company which worked with banks and

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,130
he works for a bank so I'm gonna give

00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,830
you kind of the the FinTech start-up

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,990
perspective on these things and my talk

00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,619
is gonna be about the shortcoming is in

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,180
the current banking infrastructure how

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:33,859
open banking and open source are

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,000
potential remedies and the solutions and

00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,760
most the best way to start interacting

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,960
with FinTech startups to maximize the

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,429
wins that both institutions can have so

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,620
so I'm Stephen I'm the CTO of a fin tech

00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,269
startup here in London I moved here to

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,370
London about three years ago from the

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,019
states so my background is originally

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,999
like Adam I also came from physics

00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:59,929
before I turned to the dark side and

00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:02,209
went into finance so my background is in

00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,159
a variety of things I've worked on in

00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:05,990
high tech I've worked in banking I've

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,850
worked primarily on what I would call

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,140
back office solutions for a variety of

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,850
institutions in the state before my

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,010
share to London

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,340
and I've seen a lot of back office the

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,720
good the bad the ugly and I've also been

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,040
heavily involved in the open source

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,630
community for the better part of the

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,580
last ten years so if you want to take a

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,430
look at my Kido profile and see all the

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,230
projects I contribute to my company

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,240
heavily invests in open source I think

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,100
that's kind of rare for a lot of FinTech

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,750
startups a lot of context hard ups

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,350
didn't teach things pretty close to

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,850
their chests but the actual way to move

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,770
everything forward as an industry is to

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,570
start embracing open source as the

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,070
standard that's kind of the crux of my

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,330
talk and it's something that has to

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,890
happen people can take side and also

00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:51,170
happen happen has to happen from the

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:54,590
banking side so banking it's one of the

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,940
older professions it's a profession

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,170
that's been around for quite a while so

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,420
I have here the Bank of England I think

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:05,000
this is a day at 17 33 3 of a bank in

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,620
1795 and you know in some ways some

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,750
things have changed but in some ways a

00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,759
lot of things have not changed

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,280
Adam was exactly right when he said that

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,510
the incentive structures that's inform

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,210
how management is form inside these

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,880
companies

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,410
and a bit behind the time sometimes and

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,500
that's reflected in some of the IT

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,570
choices that are done these days most of

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,200
the world sadly still runs on COBOL

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,580
systems even in 2020 I'm sure those of

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,860
you have written banking I've seen all

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,320
sorts of legacy mainframe systems that

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,090
still run large more infrastructure

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,310
across the world and that's kind of a

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,640
fact we have to do with this sector it's

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,110
slowly shifting but it's taking a lot of

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,940
effort to change and a lot of things

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,910
need to happen before we can start

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,010
getting to a more progressive IT stack

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,380
and banking so my company in particular

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,460
works with banks to help improve some

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,450
the infrastructure to help them better

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,830
address the needs of their clients so

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,510
let me kind of put these things in kind

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,060
of a broad kind of macroeconomic

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,440
perspective we have here on the left is

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,330
we have like the banking institutions is

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,390
a very 19th century ways of thinking

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,150
about the world and then we have like

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,610
the 21st century institutions and they

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,630
have a variety of or why difference in

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,410
the way they operate and how they do

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,600
business

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,860
these old institutions they just have a

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,460
certain set of IT practices that are

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,780
very old very slow very risk-averse and

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,040
then you have these very very

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,940
progressive American FinTech companies

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,650
which iterate extremely fast they get

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,660
things to market faster than anything

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,100
you can possibly imagine they're eating

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,860
a lunch and everything software is

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,150
hitting the world and what I think these

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,200
19th century history shion's have to do

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,520
is they need to embrace some of the

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,500
ideas that are common over in the

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,210
high-tech sector and embrace those over

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,470
here in the banking sector so in

00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,200
particular I would say the big problem

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,070
from these banking sectors that reliance

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,120
on external vendors to build solutions

00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,920
if you've worked in the banking sector

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,590
you've seen these these horrible

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,930
solutions that are piles upon piles of

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,610
Java code laid by piles and piles of

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,830
bodies from consultants over and over

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,450
and over again for 20 years and that's

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,260
kind of the norm that can't work forever

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,520
people need to start building the

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,140
solutions in-house and pulling the

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,109
technical expertise to kind of build

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,700
these solutions in-house we need to be

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,310
faster and iteration need to be faster

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,960
to market we need to tighten the

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,700
iteration loop between external parties

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,440
and we need to be involved with the open

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,360
source community so

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,530
these kind of ideas that are kind of

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,300
prevalent over in the high tech sector

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,400
need to start transferring over into the

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,470
banking sector if the Mexico gets a lot

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,760
because whenever I go out to the west

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,740
coast and talk with you know the

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,240
American venture capitalists you know

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,400
the big story that we're be talking

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,680
about is how do we dismantle these

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,390
institutions how do we unfold the banks

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,190
because a lot of these firms they're

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,080
getting banking licenses they're going

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,910
into financial services they're going to

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,260
come here and try to take as many

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,300
markets as they can because they can't

00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,670
grow inside of advertising and so that's

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,570
kind of the big macroeconomic trend so

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:06,630
you know banking so not here is a doom

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,760
and gloom I'm saying there's a way that

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,170
we can move forward by adopting more

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,580
open source practices that will help

00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,870
these institutions grow and can work

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,290
adapt to the times okay so the solution

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,750
that my company particular solves is we

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,300
build in-house banking solutions for

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,830
multinational corporates so the problem

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,390
that we see with most of our clients is

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,770
that they have many many divisions of

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,050
their company each one of these

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,760
divisions has one or more bank accounts

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,530
which they manage to pick them out of

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,450
their working capital for doing

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,890
day-to-day business right so how have

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,810
actually haven't had this massive

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,550
proliferation of accounts that they have

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,830
to manage internally and this becomes

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,610
the massive headache for them because

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,800
they want to focus on their core

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,200
competency of their business and not

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,940
managing all of these payments and

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,560
payable and we half of and collectible

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,750
on behalf of but they're forced to do

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,130
this in-house so so they're officers

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,330
forced to do this across the world that

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,220
are multinational corporates so

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,930
everywhere you see this there's some

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,250
some poor corporate treasurers Janis

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,690
sitting there that has to manage all

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,760
these bank accounts from all of these

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,960
different entities for all of these

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,030
different divisions of these companies

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,920
and this becomes a headache for them to

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,300
manage so we build a software solution

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,880
that allows them to better manage these

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,170
things so intrinsic to this is banking

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,850
integration at the end of the day we

00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,290
have to actually integrate with the

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,420
banks and actually be able to issue

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,440
payments be able to collect payments and

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,910
be able to query metadata about

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,880
transactions that are being sent through

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,800
these corporate bank accounts so this is

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,970
where open banking in the standard of

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,290
the European Parliament and the

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,720
government have really pushed forward

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,700
gibs banks a chance to really really

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,020
really innovate and do really really

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,789
progressive new products that can

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,410
expand their client base increase their

00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,300
deposits and open up new lines of

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:51,460
business so it's really very interesting

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:53,500
opportunity so in practice what happens

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,550
with these IT projects is it looks

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,009
something like this they have some bunch

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,210
of arty architects they sketch out some

00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,919
sort of system by which they're going to

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,659
reconcile a bunch of databases inside of

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,580
their organization there's a bunch of

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:05,169
databases they have to some sort of

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,180
business process workflow that they

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,550
model and then at the end a comes a

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,949
dashboard which some c-level executives

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,780
can manage to see what the liquidity of

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:16,000
their accounts is manage their working

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,139
capital better to issue payments or just

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,940
get a better oversight of what their

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,120
financial status actually is so you

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,919
practice this whole thing is a very you

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,150
know this is how its sketched out and

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,340
practice these things will actually turn

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:34,990
out that well actually it looked you

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:36,219
looks more like this where it's straight

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,560
instead of straight through processing

00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:40,629
tend to be straight to printer where the

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,879
actual databases are not actually done

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,190
from database database but from database

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,810
to paper to database where a manual step

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,280
is actually added to this so I've seen

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,419
this pattern over and over and over

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,599
again and all the projects that worked

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,250
on the back office so in most of these

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,930
organizations there's a massive kind of

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,630
what I call a shadow IT departments

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,009
which by hook or by crook has to make

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,930
these processes work by any means

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,120
possible not necessarily the best way

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,729
possible and so oftentimes you'll end up

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,639
with these solutions where your proposed

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,319
and M system will actually be replaced

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,240
with a bunch of very manual processes

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,130
along the way just to make it work and

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:22,120
tend to feed some sort of requirements

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:23,889
so Excel for all its utility has become

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,169
kind of the universal a corporate

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,669
interchange format because it can be

00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,500
used to evade all sorts of compliance

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,389
checks internally it's quick to email an

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,010
Excel document and increasingly we're

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,050
seeing fortune 500 companies that run

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,120
massive none of the processes basically

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,039
just on email Excel documents around and

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,930
that's kind of the de facto standard but

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,380
we to move away from that because that

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:48,459
doesn't scale as a as a way of doing

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,920
business so that's the problem of my

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,449
company addresses so if we look at like

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,960
the equivalent of what the high tech

00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,180
companies

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,520
- there's a very different kind of way

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,020
of approaching technology problems and

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,850
it's one that's based on a lot less

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:05,410
zero-sum thinking about technology so in

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,870
the web space for instance you look at

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,210
one of these web companies they depend

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,280
on a stack just like the banking sector

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,660
depends on a stack that consists

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,640
primarily of the composition of a bunch

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,790
of open source frameworks none of which

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,900
is controlled by any one single vendor

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,430
so you look at the internet stack for

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,710
instance you have tcp/ip at the lowest

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,080
level you have Linux operating system

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,520
you have applications with a bunch of no

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,350
commonly agreed-upon standards that

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,780
everybody uses and you have variety of

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,190
web protocols that bolt off of it so

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,870
these are organically-grown they're open

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,720
standards and they're collaborations

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:41,980
that go across the entire sector so

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,330
Microsoft Google Amazon Netflix they all

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,620
contribute to these web standards and

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,740
they all agree that this is the right

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,500
way to do things so this model does work

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,670
we see it working but the banking sector

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,170
needs to kind of adapt this kind of

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,270
model and open banking is kind of the

00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:00,790
right catalyst sort of start doing this

00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:03,670
on a sector-wide basis so the problem

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,630
with corporate bank accounts it's a very

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,240
simple thing at the end of the day of

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,660
account is a database ledger and that

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,920
records credits and debits it hooks into

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,820
payment infrastructure to receive wires

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,160
to issue wires it has an audit log

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,250
around who accessed the accounts of what

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,270
point in time wishing payments and it

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,400
has signatories attached with the

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,570
account which are legal requirements

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,570
about who can issue payments of those

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,310
things but banking API simply just don't

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,050
expose enough information to manage the

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,880
processes around them they require

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,860
massive amounts of systems to basically

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,260
manage all of the metadata about

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,150
transactions out-of-band so if you look

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,500
at like a swift transaction the Swift

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,150
reduction is a memo field inside of it

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,670
but it has less information than it

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,170
suites so typically you can send a wire

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,700
for a million dollars and the metadata

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,110
that you can attach to it is less than

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,680
that of a tweet that I could send out my

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,360
phone so when these institutions send

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,250
money to each other they're not able to

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,230
encode the amount of the appropriate

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,180
information that's relevant to there was

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,320
you know the receiver the transaction

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,570
and so they have to build these systems

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,950
out of band to track where the payments

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,690
are coming from and I

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,250
large companies that have entire floors

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,380
of people that basically just sit there

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,420
and scant accounts to basically match

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,620
you know a 2 million pounds to showed up

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,750
in this account where did it come from

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,250
and this is a big problem for a lot of

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,990
corporates and they spend massive

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,940
amounts of money basically just trying

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,500
to reconcile these accounts because the

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,769
banking layer just doesn't have enough

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:31,870
bandwidth because it's based on legacy

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:34,779
infrastructure so our solution really

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,699
looks like this so it's a kind of a

00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,440
broad utilization of like what a lot of

00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,790
these kind of next-generation FinTech

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,220
platforms like I look like especially in

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,019
the corporate space so we have a variety

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,949
of FinTech or physical accounts that are

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,399
associated with some of the you know

00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:49,810
well-known British banks or other banks

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,550
across the world these are physical

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,980
accounts they're opened up by the bank

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,389
itself let me have possibly virtual

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,209
account structure on top of those which

00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,040
manage specific subsets of the funds in

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,779
those and we have a variety of business

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,190
rules we have a bunch of fun segregation

00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,070
rules and compliance rules that are laid

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,329
on top of the payments that either

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,880
restrict or allow certain payments to be

00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:13,390
done and then at the end of this we have

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,130
a bunch of business actors that can

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,170
collect on behalf of and pay on behalf

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,390
of we connect into a variety of earpiece

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,060
systems we connect into payment api's

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,790
like wire transfers and we have to do

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,100
over a bunch of reporting obligations so

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,500
the solution that my company builds is

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,410
basically to replace all of this manual

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,790
piles of Java that are typically done in

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,040
a place it with a single end to end

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,690
solution that uses open banking talk

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,570
with the physical API or physical Mecca

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,550
counts and then uses API integration to

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,720
talk with a variety of the external

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,470
services that have to degree inside the

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,529
organization so this is unique because

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,920
the solution that we built has two big

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,569
open-source components to it these are

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,670
things that we as an organization have

00:12:55,569 --> 00:13:01,269
chosen to open source because they're

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:03,220
not our core competency as a company so

00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:06,430
open banking and the API is that we do

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,899
to a variety of our you know to a

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,029
variety of solutions that are typically

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:11,769
used in Seidel recommendations are

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,860
things that other context should be open

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,779
sourcing because they're not part of the

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,709
core competency of our business and so

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,050
this is a pattern that you should

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,690
practice the

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,240
it's one that basically allows a lot of

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,529
organizations to open up more of the

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,100
infrastructure to focus on things that

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,630
actually mattered in the business these

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,910
are just example account by the way

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,019
there's no affiliation with my company

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,649
without this and it is it's just

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:41,089
examples so what we build is digital

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,089
in-house banking solutions that allow

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,250
multinational corporates to better layer

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,029
these business rules and these

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,060
transaction flows on top of their

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,950
existing bank account infrastructure so

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,269
in particular we can do you know 10

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,010
million transfers between five different

00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:58,260
multinational entities in two minutes

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,120
versus the 1.5 months it takes to

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,740
manually so that's a big win for a lot

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,500
of these regulations so open banking

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,730
it's a very European phenomenon it's one

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,120
that I think is gonna be extremely

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,459
important for the established franchise

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,470
service providers here to get on ahead

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,649
up because I think it's a once in a

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,810
generation kind of opportunity to

00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,310
catalyze a lot of change and open up a

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:28,110
whole new lines of business for these

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,810
banks so you've seen primarily a lot of

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,279
this push forward in the retail space

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,810
but I think there's a lot more business

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,490
opportunities for don't like corporate

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,720
account side as well so my company in

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,100
particular we don't touch gate retail

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,540
banking we primarily just deal with

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:45,060
corporate accounts but open banking

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,279
allows the potential for a lot of

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,930
clients to better utilize the data that

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,910
they're already at giving to these banks

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,920
and utilize it and query it in a way

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,370
that's more structured it integrates

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,050
better with their systems so there's

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,360
large opportunities for the banks to

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,160
really just increase just streamline

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,740
integration with our key clients which

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,970
will lower costs and to just increase

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,709
the deposit of the clients if they're

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,779
able to build these kind of in-house

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,089
solutions they can open up a lot more

00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,920
account with the banks they can use the

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,019
chance they have more efficiently they

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,850
can deposit more funds and overall just

00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:21,480
increases the bank usage doesn't detract

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:24,329
from it but there's a big kind of gap

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,860
between where PSD to as it was laid up

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,540
by the government and where it's

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,260
actually implemented by the banks these

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,230
days and that Delta is kind of yet to be

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,430
filled and yet

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,570
to be fulfilled by a lot of the

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,430
developer teams inside of these

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,680
organizations so I think a lot of that

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,920
is kind of what Adam mentioned kind of a

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,750
cultural difference between how

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,360
typically risk-averse organizations have

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,280
approached developments in the past and

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,830
so I kind of wanted to lay out what I

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,540
think from the FinTech startups side or

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:58,390
that kind of key points to think about

00:15:52,540 --> 00:16:00,070
how to best approach the but the

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,740
technical cultural and commercial sides

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,490
of doing a little bit banking so I put

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,530
together kind of a a guideline about how

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,440
to best approach internal development

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:14,080
open banking api's so this comes from my

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,920
experience of reverse engineering a few

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,500
of the European bank api's and what we

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,730
saw was not good some of them are better

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,660
than others but a lot of them are very

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,820
very nascent

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,200
and if this is gonna be a big thing it's

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,840
best to kind of follow what kind of set

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,370
of best practices that a lot of web

00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,920
protocols have already gone through and

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,510
not reinvent the wheel all the time so

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,360
these are the kind of things that I

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:41,050
learned from working with large banking

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,400
api's from the past three years it's

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,320
absolutely important to decrease the

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,170
barrier to enter to this api's you have

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,600
to make it easy to spin up developers on

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,920
these ABI if you can't actually allocate

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,450
you know a bunch of my engineers to

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,550
actually figure out your making API in

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,600
like two weeks it's probably not kind of

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,610
we're probably not going to integrate

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,660
with your platform we're probably not

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,760
going to be able to do it because the

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,580
barrier to entry is too high and often

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,620
times these things are the API is were

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,240
pushed in one very small corner of the

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,250
bank and it's not given sufficient

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,740
funding and it's not really seen as a

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,020
it's seen as a cost center rather than

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,640
as a investment and so these things

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,190
don't get the like little light of day

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,720
that they should

00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:24,850
don't put your documentation behind a

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,590
login screen so no big you know if you

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,830
look at stripes API for instance you go

00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:31,660
into stripe github page you can get 15

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,370
different programming language SDKs you

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,860
can download them in ten seconds you

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,210
immediately to a HTML page doesn't

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,340
require you to log in you can see where

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,490
all the API endpoints that's a very

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,830
progressive model that we should follow

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,620
don't make me sign up for

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,090
whenever you know developer login to

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,460
basically its feel to access and query

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,549
what your API is doing make it as

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,440
seamless as possible

00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,910
don't make me also contact your customer

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,700
services department or go through a

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,400
client or go through a relationship

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,929
officer or anything just put your

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,960
documentation in the public that's kind

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,270
of key have a public github repository

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:15,160
which was suggested case you'd be

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:16,960
shocked by about how many banks have

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,309
these things hidden behind it's this

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,750
massive walls of synapse that you have

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,790
to do to basically just get on board it

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,890
on there with sandbox environments this

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,120
can't possibly exists American tech

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,100
firms don't do this

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,650
banks should not do this this is not the

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,000
future you should be able to spin up a

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,809
sandbox environment of public cloud

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,880
obviously when you're dealing with

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,220
banking API s you don't want us to give

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,150
like a you know login credentials to

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,710
anybody on the Internet

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,929
but you probably want to be able to have

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,960
a sandbox API that you can log in

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:49,600
simulate account transactions you know

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,130
see how the API works end to end not on

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,350
a live account but on the simulated

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,630
accounts this is a very simple thing

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,730
that the most public API is Web API is

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,530
to these days but it's very rare to see

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,360
making so basically instead of trying to

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,400
spin up something inside of your

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,410
internal infrastructure at your bank you

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,470
know pull out the company card buy a you

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,919
know $10 AWS instance load your code up

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,419
there put a bunch of mocks simulate it

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,950
don't don't make me kind of login to

00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:18,100
everything just to get the sandbox to

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,130
see if the API is work using common

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,690
encryption standards don't roll your own

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,760
you know you have a wide variety of

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,980
standard of the laid out by eye things

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,370
like the NIST organization run how to do

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,290
you know RSA elliptic curve cryptography

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,549
don't invent your own cryptography and

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,370
sign up your bank you're not gonna do it

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:38,830
right this I've seen in the scares make

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,740
white have been actually avoid the

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,910
cryptography hairball soften times the

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,049
security layers of these things I know

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,790
how this happened actually there was a

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:50,169
board meeting and we're about four or

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,630
five different models proposed by how to

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:54,280
secure authenticate users and so the

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,940
executive in charge of our product said

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,320
why don't we just do all four of them

00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,690
until you end up with this kind of

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,460
multi-layered authentication mechanism

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,580
by which I have to authenticate four or

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,960
five times just to access an account

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,320
don't do that make one authentication

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,059
mechanism and pick one method of doing

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,669
transport left for security across this

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,990
don't encrypt it and do TLS or just pick

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:17,690
one

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,779
don't multi-layered cryptography is not

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,429
making your platform more secure pick

00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:26,029
one for protocol level and one for

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,309
transit these days XML is not the

00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:31,309
preferred interchange format anymore

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,529
pick a public standard like JSON if

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:35,090
preferable you can have XML to fall back

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:39,500
but most developers days don't want to

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,700
be coughing up large XML hairballs don't

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,350
reinvent the wheel I mean we know how to

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,470
build public API is there's a wide

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:48,860
variety of best practices about how to

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,809
build restful api is these days don't

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:55,100
try to roll your own misspoke thing

00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:57,710
in-house you know expose Spanish check

00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,570
syrupy ice so I should be able to query

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,190
whether you know the bank is actually

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,169
able to service my request before I do

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,450
my requests so oftentimes these things

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:06,860
have to have a certain atomic nature to

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,259
them when I'm dealing with real money so

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,330
I want to know before I issue like say

00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,340
you know a 10 million dollar wire that

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,519
you know the banking API is behaving as

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,679
normal you know have a status dashboard

00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,419
to all your partners to check on the

00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,399
uptime of the API so downtime is

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:24,379
actually quite common with these banking

00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:27,409
api's I've seen them go down for days on

00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:29,120
end that's ok and this happens in the

00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:30,200
API is but you know you need people

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,340
check on the status to make sure that

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,919
you know it's not my system that's

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,720
failing it's something on the banks and

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
then iterate quickly inversion your API

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,159
is so these things don't have to be kind

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,049
of the golden standard of API that will

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,580
kind of live reverence at the bank you

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,399
can version these things have a v1 or v2

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,129
of v3 v4 and then support maybe the last

00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:50,870
two of them don't think that you have to

00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:52,340
have this kind of forever and always API

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,129
that will kind of live forever and

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,779
service all clients it's ok to iterate

00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:59,080
quickly and sort of break things move

00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:59,080
forward

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:08,600
so the kind of three big points I see

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,850
that the banks need to embrace when

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,580
doing these kind of open banking ap

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,590
night transformation projects so you

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,120
really need to embrace open source the

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,800
only way this is ever going to add value

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,420
to the organization is if it comes an

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,700
open source effort I need to be able to

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,710
go to you know pick your favorite high

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,970
street bank go to their getup page and

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,210
download mystic eight actually builder

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,920
products if that's not possible or

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,690
there's too many too much red tape or

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,560
too many barriers to entry we're just

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,740
not going to do it we're gonna go to

00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,140
your competitors you need to set up

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,390
corporate github accounts this is very

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,550
very small thing but you know just being

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,530
able to ship your SDKs to developers in

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,490
a way that they expect is really key and

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,720
it's not a very hard thing to do you can

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,040
sign up for a corporate account have all

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,350
the compliant checks in place on your

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,850
code you know restrict access but it's a

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,810
very simple thing just to disseminate

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,310
the SDKs for your libraries and then you

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,480
should really see FinTech startups as

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:07,250
your beta testers these products FinTech

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,690
startups have a vested interest in

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,920
collaborating with large corporates for

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,180
a variety of reasons and you should see

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,920
us as the beta tester because we're

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,020
willing to put up with quite a bit to

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,370
make our code work with your code we're

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,020
going to spend months and months months

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,130
of investment just to make sure

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,570
everything works and ten so you

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,930
shouldn't see us as the users think of

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,250
us as the beta testers because we're

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,720
here to help you make your code better

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,240
and we're here to help build products

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,470
that enable you to get more customers so

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,810
what Adam actually did I thought was I

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,070
very very appropriate as well because

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,870
there's a big difference in the

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,250
open-source culture versus what I would

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,360
call the traditional enterprise software

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,550
culture so financial services really

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,960
needs to kind of embrace what I would

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,010
call the open-source culture something

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
I've been involved in for most of my

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,490
life and it's one that definitely thinks

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,290
externally first you should think how

00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,680
your code is going to work outside of

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,060
the organization as well as inside

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,340
should think internationally first code

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:09,650
these days it's not a phenomenon is

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:11,120
limited to one region should reject

00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,870
thinking this kind of zero-sum thinking

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,150
that if we open up our code it's going

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:19,800
somehow you know degrade the quality of

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:21,960
our application or introduce competitive

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,210
risk because in practice making your

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,930
platform more open is only the trend of

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,030
most of these solutions these days in

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,380
practice exposing SDK access is only

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,510
going to let your customers do things

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,809
they wanted to do anyways and it's going

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:38,760
to label more clients and more FinTech

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,730
startups to build solutions that utilize

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,960
your platform and the most important

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,460
thing what open-source culture is that

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,350
it's a community of people it's a very

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,690
small people it's kind of this Pareto

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,070
distribution whereabouts you know 90% of

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,590
the work of somebody with 10% of people

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,150
in the world and if you'd look at the

00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,160
get up statistic suppose this as well

00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,170
there's a really really dedicated group

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,059
of people that are extremely prolific

00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,230
and open source and if you can attract

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,270
people that are prolific open source

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,020
developers they're gonna do amazing

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,880
amounts of things as business

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,990
organization but open source engineers

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,270
want to work with other open source

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,100
engineers and the most important thing

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,809
about the open source community is it

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,940
transcends any one organization and

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:17,910
that's a good thing and a bad thing

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,320
primarily when you have employees that

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,780
move on you know they build that works

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,610
with organizations and allow

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,040
connectivity and bring in new business

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,929
if they know because they bring the

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,510
expertise but using your API to other

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,980
organizations and the more and more that

00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,160
the kind of standards and best practices

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,679
becomes crystallized across an entire

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,090
sector the more we will able to improve

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,350
the entire sector that only happens when

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,600
you have this kind of cross-pollination

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,010
of employees moving between companies

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,900
that are able to collaborate with build

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,520
these kind of best practices we saw that

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,410
with the web and we're gonna see that

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,330
with banking eventually maybe not this

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:57,000
decade but what's hopefully the best so

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,590
what I would call the kind of key point

00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,790
about open FinTech is that the key

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,200
differentiator of your company is the

00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,240
trust of your clients and the user

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,220
experience of your product not the code

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,510
that connects it to it and if your

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,679
company doesn't embrace open source

00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:12,120
their competitors will so thank you

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,750
there's the contact information for my

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,750
company and

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,660
