In a recent Twitter poll which received over 2,000 responses, 65% of respondents claimed that being able to release and contribute to open-source software as part of their full-time job was somewhat or extremely important. Only 18% thought it was not important at all.

Facebook ran a survey with its new engineering recruits in 2015—when it was still one of the most desirable Silicon Valley companies to work for—75% mentioned Facebook’s open-source programme as a key reason they had joined the company.

In a market where there’s much more demand for software engineers than there is supply, building a strong open-source culture is critical to recruit and retain top talent. And promoting it is just as important.

In this talk, Tobie explains why software engineers care so much about open source, what you can do to foster a strong open-source culture, and how you can make sure to effectively promote it to attract—and retain—top talent.

The Open Source in Fintech Event Series is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).

Before the COVID-19 crisis, the events took place at meetups in Edinburgh and London, and they will again – when it is safe to do so! We've also started a new group in Bristol and look forward to our first face-to-face event there as soon as it's possible.

You can join the groups here to be the first to hear about future events and webinars:
