[Music]

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:23,550
without further ado allow me to

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:27,119
introduce Chris Anna chick Chris is the

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,769
CTO I believe of the cloud Native

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,290
community computing foundation that I'll

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:35,940
let Chris correct me from and is also

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,250
heavily involved in the to do group

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,110
which is the Linux foundations in

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,140
information sharing group for those

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,079
involved in running open source programs

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,969
at Linux Foundation members so Chris is

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,710
going to talk to us today about best

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,610
practices for running an open source

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,030
program and project Chris go ahead and

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,850
complete the connection and take it away

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,880
cool good good to hear from everyone

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,409
today so a little brief introduction

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,229
about myself before I can I dive in on

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,799
the topic around you know best practices

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,270
and lessons learned from both the cloud

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,290
native computing foundation community

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,360
kubernetes project and to new group a

00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,820
little background of myself so I helped

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,470
start both the cloud native computing

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,790
foundation and the open container

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,049
initiative which were kind of efforts

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:34,290
around bringing standards to containers

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,450
and also a kind of neutral home for

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,579
container and climate related projects

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,040
I'm also the vice president developer

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,899
relations at the Linux Foundation

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,930
responsible for the to do group and and

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,360
bringing on new kind of foundations to

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,850
the organization in a previous life you

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,549
know I used to run open source a Twitter

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,500
created their open source office was

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,110
that open-source maintainer working on

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,850
things such as gentoo linux fedora you

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,640
know spend some time in the in the Red

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,920
Hat and IBM occult lines I think back in

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,920
the day working on a variety of projects

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,500
so kind of a fun little background from

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,959
you know open-source maintainer to

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,950
person running foundations the last five

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,959
years have been a little bit

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,879
crazy for me so I apologize if I'm a

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,680
little extra Haggard today especially

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,420
with the pandemic but you know the

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,569
kubernetes and cloud native ecosystems

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,450
has grown significantly in the last five

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,060
years so it's been kind of a wild ride

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,069
to watch a technology grow so fast and

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,680
have so much impact in industry but on

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,470
the bright side when things tend to grow

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,390
incredibly fast there's a lot of useful

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,400
lessons that you have kind of glean from

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,720
that effort and a lot of mistakes that

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,200
you kind of share with folks so they

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,810
could kind of learn learn from you so

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,519
you know I don't know how familiar you

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,440
know people here on the call with kind

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,610
of open source if it's whispered in the

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,190
general so I'm gonna spend a little time

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,470
kind of giving a brief you know you know

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,060
update of of my view of what's going on

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,040
in the industry before diving in on some

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,200
you know practical tips and lessons

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,970
people could learn from and then I'd

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,150
like to really open up for questions to

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,450
kind of keep things interactive towards

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,670
the end so I'm sure a lot of you are

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,940
familiar with this that open source is

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,980
no longer a hobbyist thing it's in

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,170
widespread use all over the enterprise

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,870
it's very easy for people generally to

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,600
consume open source these days this is

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,700
some data from our to do group survey

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,180
that we put up every year around open

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,940
source programs that essentially service

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,340
surveys corporations and corporate open

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,239
source programs out there based on you

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,010
know what they're kind of doing with

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,690
open source are you using it for

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,430
commercial non-commercial reasons are

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,280
you contributing code upstream are you

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,540
speaking at open source events and you

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,700
know the data basically shows the

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,459
majority of people are consuming this is

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,280
no surprise for everyone there's still a

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,840
lot of work to do about people

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,389
contributing upstream I think one little

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,250
interesting tidbit that I'd like to

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,489
share with folks is it seems the

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,769
financial services industry is pretty

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:12,540
good about you know using you know

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,120
essentially you know open source out

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,709
there but when it comes to actually

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,560
contributing and sharing code upstream

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,539
they tend to not be as strong as you

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,380
know there are other peer industry at

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,580
verticals but there's a lot of

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,919
interesting data for you to kind of

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,150
glean from that survey linked off the

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,699
github on this slide but

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,260
hopefully with efforts like you know fit

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,720
awesome the work Linux Foundation does

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,699
we get kind of change you know this so

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,400
people are not only just consumers but

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,900
are contributing you know upstream the

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,520
projects and open sourcing things that

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,500
they find useful to to share with the

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,419
world you know

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,520
another trend that's happening that a

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,460
lot of people you know should be

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,410
familiar with is you know the historical

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,050
kind of web scale internet scale

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,150
companies out there given that their

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,340
business models are really not about

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,229
selling software they're usually selling

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,580
services have been kind of on an

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,010
open-source bonanza

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,449
they've been sharing you know a lot of

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,090
work that they've been doing to scale

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,680
their own services you know from you

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,110
know google with kubernetes and

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,520
tensorflow you know twitter and my time

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,350
at twitter we basically open source the

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,030
majority of our infrastructure not

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,770
related to our ad server

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,630
you know folks like lead in open source

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,440
Kafka and Netflix has this famous a

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,510
Netflix OSS stack lift you know open

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,389
source envoy because they were you know

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,099
struggling dealing with a commercial /

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,950
open source alternative called nginx so

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:38,680
there's this kind of notion that you

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,419
know it's it's ok to share we we open

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,039
source kind of what we're innovating and

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,280
essentially have our peers use that it's

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,810
kind of becoming very commonplace in the

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,120
internet scale companies which is great

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,919
because you know there were essentially

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,930
you know facing a lot of scaling

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,310
challenges and sharing what they learn

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,190
where other industries and companies

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,560
kind of take advantage of what they

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,260
built the other kind of big you know

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,180
change that I've noticed in kind of open

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,880
source land in general we've generally

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,289
moved from let's let's say like single

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,960
vendor closed ecosystems you know from

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:15,820
the past of you know you only buying you

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,400
know a piece of software from one vendor

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,970
or closed or the you know set a software

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,490
to more kind of healthy distributed

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,860
multi vendor cross vendor eco open

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,250
ecosystems you know things like you know

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,330
CN CF things like there is five

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,669
organization things like finis these are

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,229
all kind of healthy multiple vendor or

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,900
open ecosystems and this is basically

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,320
happening to almost every industry

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,540
vertical out there and will continue

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,980
to happen and just like I mentioned you

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,660
know this is open sourcing is not

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,660
slowing down anytime soon it's gonna

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,380
continue to you know work its way into

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,000
new industries as people find a way to

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,060
externalize some of their R&D costs and

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,630
also collaborate with their peers on

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,450
essential you know a commodity any

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,950
things so open source program so with

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,230
all this you know rise of open source

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,350
goodness what are open source programs

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,730
so it's been this trend you know as I

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,430
mentioned a lot of these internet scale

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,440
companies you know have been very

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,910
successful in adopting and you know

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,590
contributing and building open source

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,390
projects and communities and so one

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,550
thing they did as part of this in

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,470
lessons they learned is they essentially

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,120
needed to create a center of competency

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,870
or a group of folks that essentially

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,070
owned the problem of what do you do with

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,990
all this open source that you both

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,800
consume and produce just like an

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,270
organization would have a you know a

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,920
chief security officer or security

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,180
office to kind of deal with security

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,430
issues these companies have kind of

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,990
pioneered the case of establishing an

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,270
open-source program so you know you

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,590
could look at some of the programs from

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,660
Google and Facebook but you know this is

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,240
you know started maybe with these kind

00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,610
of internet scale companies but now has

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,470
really I've been you know pioneered all

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,730
over throughout industries you have kind

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,010
of little old-school traditional

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,160
companies like your Autodesk Comcast's

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:09,760
of the world you know two big chip

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,430
companies like Intel you know Samsung

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,780
Salesforce you know start off see these

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,980
companies aren't really startups these

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,600
days anymore since they're

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,910
well-established all the companies but

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,030
back when they were in their early kind

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,360
of young days they knew that it was

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,820
important to create an open-source

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,430
program Microsoft as you're well aware

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,830
has a very extensive open-source program

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,360
they're heavily invested in a good

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,390
source these days even by picking up

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,000
github good for them some companies are

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,450
even establishing you know chief

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,520
open-source officers der kondal out in

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,630
VMware kind of leads their open-source

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,630
thing so these are kind of serious

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,760
executive positions for open sourcing so

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,700
fit agree where does a tunic of problem

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,130
so when you know I was building out the

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,660
open-source

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,090
we're gonna Twitter there was kind of a

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,640
small group of us in the Bay Area that

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,590
were essentially you know commiserating

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,880
uh you know privately dealing with

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,710
issues of like you know how do you deal

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,980
with this issue you know hey this person

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,990
potentially you know inserted GPL code

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,150
in a mobile app we thought it a little

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,460
bit late you know how do you do you know

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,170
automated checking and so on back in

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,870
your company so we essentially you know

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,550
started this group as kind of a private

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,520
mailing list amongst you know companies

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,920
like Google a Google you know Twitter or

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,710
Facebook and a couple others to kind of

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,090
just share you know practices you know

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,340
how did you build your developer

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,610
dashboard how do you prove your ROI for

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,220
your company and so on and so you know

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,620
this informal thing eventually became a

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,150
formal thing which we called the to do

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,030
group and announced it at the Facebook

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,840
on a scale conference in 2014 and

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,100
eventually we decided that the

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,280
organization needed to become a little

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,960
more formalized and moved it to a Linux

00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,410
Foundation to establish a more formal

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,960
entity and governance structure for that

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,610
to do group so you know what exactly is

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,560
a to do group outside of just a group of

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,930
companies that are collaborating on you

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,570
know running open source programs well

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,250
you know essentially that is the core of

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,440
it you know we're an affiliate kind of

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,300
network for companies that either having

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,370
a open source program or about to

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,680
establish an open source program we

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,080
share software training materials and

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,700
other kind of useful things that you

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,010
know people could benefit from who are

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,600
kind of in this position because even

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,240
though open source programs tend to be a

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,730
little bit different across companies

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,210
there's a lot of similar tools and

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,430
lessons learned that could be shared

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:43,190
amongst amongst each other so one

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,380
important thing to know about this is

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,860
you know there is a kind of a difference

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,240
between what you would have considered

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,670
like hobbyist open-source such as an

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,940
open-source project versus truly

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,140
corporate scale open source you know one

00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,630
thing we noticed when we're kind of

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,120
building out our programs is the tools

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,630
that you need to manage you know you

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,630
know hundreds of repositories or you

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,870
know thousands of engineers working on

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,390
you know upstream projects or stuff like

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,430
that it is very complicated a lot of

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,200
tools out there whether like github or

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,570
get loud these days just weren't really

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,990
built in money to deal with corporate

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,990
scale open source so we generally went

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:29,360
out ahead and you know grafted and built

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,550
tools on top of github etc to kind of

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,260
deal with corporate scale open source

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,110
problems the tools are getting a little

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,810
bit better these days but you know that

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,240
was kind of the original impetus of the

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,580
group to kind of get around this problem

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,410
you know historically you know get up

00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,420
steam management and role management was

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,120
absolutely atrocious back in a day and

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,820
we worked successfully with github to

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,530
improve that system over time so things

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,050
are a little bit you know better now

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,970
than they than they were before another

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,650
thing that we kind of served for a time

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,320
you know when github was very small we

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,230
kind of served as their product Council

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,370
to improve a variety of features so a

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,700
lot of things that you've kind of seen

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,790
github may have ended up you know coming

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,280
from the tutor group pushing github and

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:19,640
we actually have a repo out there that

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,160
github checks quite frequently and works

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,640
with basically is just all the problems

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,980
that you have dealing with github so

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,110
check that out if you're interested in

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,340
looking at some of the kind of ideas and

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,310
suggestions we've had to improve the

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,200
platform over the years and you know in

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,570
terms of membership we're about Fino 50

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,970
or so organizations spanning you know a

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,550
variety of companies out there and we're

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,560
always looking to kind of learn and

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,240
bring on new folks from from new

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,940
industries it would be great in my

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,650
opinion to have some more financial

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,390
related companies involved in the group

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,300
we have a we have a couple with you know

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,400
fidelity and and so on but I would love

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,250
to really see more organizations from

00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,740
the finance side so another thing the

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,390
two new group does as I mentioned is you

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,770
know given that open source programs are

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,500
still a bit of a nation you know

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,180
practice industry a few years ago we

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,330
decided to create a survey that we

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,290
essentially you know a partner with

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,210
publication called a new stack and

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,370
essentially go out and send this out to

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,080
all companies out there to kind of get

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,880
of whether they have an open-source

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,770
program what they're looking at plan

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,270
I think old an open-source program are

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,880
they using open-source what are their

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,310
kind of problems and so on so we share

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,500
this data every year

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,730
we're actually we just launched the 22

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,920
edition of the survey so if your

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,150
organization is using open source source

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,430
building open source program we'd love

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,980
to hear from you I have a link there for

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,300
you to see but in general um you know

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,680
this is kind of useful information

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,839
especially if you're looking to figure

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,339
out you know what is the size of an open

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,410
source you know program you know

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:59,180
compared to you know other organizations

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,920
and one interesting thing from you know

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,420
at least a survey you kind of see the

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,830
you know which type of industry

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,529
verticals have open source programs

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,170
obviously both kind of tech and telco

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,900
oddly haven't had a bit of bias compared

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,820
to others always compared to you know

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,710
financial services which comes down a

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:22,760
little bit the middle middle rank

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:23,960
compared to everyone else I talked a

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,310
little bit out you know snorting you

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,680
have a source program before diving into

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,620
some kind of tips and and actresses and

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,540
friends and so on so the tutor grant

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,390
maintains a open source program

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,790
definition you know which should we kind

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,850
of cultivated over the years and we have

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,870
a guy that you kind of learn from so

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:50,180
[Applause]

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:55,400
crazy that got noise cool thank you

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,810
forever muted the hairdryer so you could

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,550
look at our open source definition if

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,380
you're kind of looking to understand

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:05,540
what an actual open source program is

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,980
you know if you if you have one within

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,850
your company you should be kind of aware

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,790
that open source program

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,870
responsibilities kind of vary across

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,580
organization depending you know what

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,410
type of you know product your company

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,510
sells you know if you're mostly selling

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,580
you know services software is less you

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,010
know potentially relevant to you but if

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,690
you're selling software you know

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,070
obviously you have to have a little bit

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,350
more particular strategy around how you

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,760
manage your IP but you know generally

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,950
these are some responsibilities that

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,290
open source programs share and a lot all

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,379
this informations up available on the

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:39,709
tutor group github and website

00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:41,990
one thing we also do is share software

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,759
and ideas so we have something called an

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,759
awesome list or open source program

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,160
management a lot of challenges that our

00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,199
open source programs faced were around

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,899
you know how do you manage potentially

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,430
seal is at scale how do you deal with

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,629
metrics across different projects and

00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,910
organizations how you deal with

00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,250
developer affiliations what tools do you

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,410
use for licensing internet

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,000
internationalization and so on so we

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,610
have all these available online for you

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,819
to kind of poke at play with them learn

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,670
from and even contribute contribute your

00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,319
own the other thing you know that I'll

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,180
stress is you know a lot of these

00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,639
programs are basically able to scale

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,899
based on just developing tooling to kind

00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,449
of deal with all sorts of problems

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,670
whether it's you know linking

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,709
repositories we have a tool called repo

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,370
linter which basically just links a

00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:33,829
github repository for quality so whether

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,920
you know you have a security MD file or

00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,269
you have a license file etc you know

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,680
licenses and every file so it's just

00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:41,350
kind of useful tools like this that we

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,600
kind of share and if you kind of look at

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,639
that link I shared earlier a lot of

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,790
companies can have shared their tools in

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:53,920
terms of how they manage open source at

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:56,529
scale another thing that you know

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,100
companies have kind of been doing mostly

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:03,139
internally is building a you know open

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,400
sourced and it TechRadar free

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,750
organization so I don't know if people

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,039
are familiar with an organization out

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,720
there called thoughtworks but they kind

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,459
of put together this thought works

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,049
TechRadar and you know showing which

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:15,890
technology is that you should you know

00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:19,610
adopt or assess or drop etc well there's

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,049
a project out there called Zalando open

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,000
sourced which allows you to build your

00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,130
own TechRadar in a lot of open source

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,589
programs that I've worked with

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:31,419
essentially have been kind of serving as

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:33,770
almost like a architecture review or or

00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:35,630
you know source of truth when it comes

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,280
to which open source projects we should

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,409
kind of look at and this is kind of one

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,190
mechanism that some of them are starting

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:44,409
to use internally to kind of share

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,610
practices so I generally recommend

00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,130
checking that out super useful better

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,550
than essentially a

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:54,400
a spreadsheet of some type and and

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:57,010
finally you know there's a lot of guides

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,780
that we've open-sourced from you know

00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,770
learning how to archive your open source

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,030
project you have to do how do you

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,860
measure your open source program and

00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,440
they're all kind of available online in

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,690
you know English Japanese Chinese and a

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,440
variety languages so please you know

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,090
check them out in detail so now let's

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,880
talk a little bit more about starting

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,900
and cultivating an open source approach

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
project you know why you should do it

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,590
what lessons have we learned in you know

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,650
CNC - tutor group that we kind of share

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,720
with the wider audience so you know when

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,170
it comes to starting an open source

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,270
project you know there's many reasons to

00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,040
do it depending if you're you know

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,410
company you know maybe you want to

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,700
undercut your competition competition

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,380
somehow maybe you want to share and

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,180
externalize some R&D so you're not doing

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,430
all the work on a particular project

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,800
maybe you want to commoditize a market

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,210
you know similar to what IBM did with

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,190
Eclipse tooling where they basically

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,050
decided to come out commoditize most of

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,180
the developer tooling you know the

00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:54,730
market out there so companies like you

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,080
know Morlan don't really exist anymore

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,900
maybe you want to build an ecosystem

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,220
kind of like the kubernetes play maybe

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,250
own engage and partner with your

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,900
customers and so on and kind of support

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,070
some kind of common or commodity piece

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,190
of software so there's lots of good

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,020
reasons to you know start an open-source

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,120
you know project could be hiring you

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:18,940
know common thing for a lot of companies

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:21,970
and in the internet scale area so some

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,040
good questions - oops I got a little

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,900
track so questions before you should ask

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,810
the questions you asked yourself before

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,970
you start an open-source project is you

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,860
know number one are you duplicating any

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,100
work that may exist out there you know

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,360
there's a hundred million plus

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,010
repositories out there and projects that

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,200
exist so I think it's important to kind

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,290
of get your bearings on where engineers

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,300
have a tendency to reinvent the wheel or

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,220
start from scratch versus joining a

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,810
sixteen effort think portable and

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,670
open-source program office is to

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,900
evaluate and ensure that that

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,920
duplication is not happening

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,540
understanding what constitutes success

00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,760
for an open-source project that's going

00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,870
to be different or you know you know

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,490
everyone

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,840
you know can you actually financially

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,520
support and sustain the project there's

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,620
many times we've interacted with

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,300
companies that you know open sourced

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,340
something shared it on you know github

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,260
or you know whatever place but they

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,480
didn't really invest in you know

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,370
building a community or even you know

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,300
throwing engineering resources on it you

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,130
know they're like oh we just open

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,660
sources to share some lessons and we put

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,720
someone part-time on it you know that's

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,390
not really gonna help you know long term

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,400
it truly takes a bit of open-source

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,510
gardening and cultivating kind of really

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,880
grow project it really you know

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:37,510
community doesn't really come for free

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,730
so a lot of these lessons are shared in

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,340
the guide that I link below in terms of

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,070
starting at an open-source project

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,230
so kind of you know head towards they're

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,850
kind of final chapter here for our talk

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,100
today before I open it up for questions

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,920
is some best practices and kind of you

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,690
know basic lessons we've learned over

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,970
the years you know within the tutor

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,040
group and my recent experience in CNC

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,290
yeah this shouldn't be a surprise for

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,720
anyone using standard office licenses is

00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:08,640
great you know OSI FSF approved license

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,960
we generally amend permissive licenses

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,200
particularly Apache to do its patent

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,780
friendliness uh so you know we kind of

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,840
detail in a CN CF blog post why we

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,520
explicitly recommend Apache I highly

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,660
recommend you take a read of that but

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,030
this should be kind of standard

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,910
operating procedure for anyone if your

00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,790
goal is true wide adoption we find

00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:33,070
permissive licenses generally work the

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,840
best for that and preferably ones that

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,270
have some language in it to kind of deal

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,870
with you know patents and so on could

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,940
could definitely help you know one thing

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,950
that we do within C&C F that's been

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:50,530
super useful is have all of our projects

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,640
have a best practices bad from the core

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,470
infrastructure initiative which is

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,660
another Linux Foundation project you can

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,280
basically think of this as know if you

00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,380
read the book checklist manifesto but

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,720
essentially it is a checklist of things

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,559
and practices that an open source

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,970
project should have as a best practice

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,340
these are things like you should have a

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,020
potential security disclosure mechanism

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,300
you should have static analysis you

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,340
should have a way for projects to

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,980
contact you to report issues you know

00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,440
kind of

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,529
basic you know things that are just

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,450
super useful for people to kind of go

00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,370
through and ensure that their project

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,080
has because evidently developers forget

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,990
things but essentially is a good way to

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,760
kind of codify you know best practices

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,529
we've seen over the years and we have

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,179
you know thousands a few thousand

00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:38,539
projects now that have adopted this

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:41,120
across the open-source ecosystem so

00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:42,559
highly recommend everyone kind of take

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,380
takes a look at that

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,360
you know developer statistics you know

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,799
there's many tools out there but a lot

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,799
of the stuff that comes built in with

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,960
github or gitlab is generally not

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,179
sufficient so we generally recommend

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,580
people either take a look at kind of

00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,990
what we done with a project called dev

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,539
stats there's companies out there like

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,850
Sergio that build stuff too but in

00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:08,090
general I think it's important to have a

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,340
singular dashboard you could point

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,700
people to within your community to

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,669
understand the healthier projects you

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,169
know who's contributing and so on and so

00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:22,340
one thing that I'm serious for this

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:25,070
really quick you know we have a simple

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:27,559
dashboard here for the CN CF community

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,059
which just shows you know here's all our

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,409
projects not the prettiest thing in the

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,929
world and if apologize but here's all

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,909
the projects you can see you know days

00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,070
since last commit all these are fairly

00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:39,190
active you can see number of commits you

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,840
know are they increasing versus the last

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,130
you know three months for sis occur in

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,289
three months and you kind of have just a

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,380
quick you know overview of health you

00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:49,850
can look for a medium you know median

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,559
time they respond the issue is across

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,860
these things so stuff like this within

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:57,049
your open source project or community is

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,059
a super value even internally as a

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:03,889
company having something like this is

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,769
super important to really understand you

00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:09,860
know the health of things the other

00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:12,649
thing that we generally recommend is

00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,820
having an open governance structure and

00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:20,659
that's truly just you know defining how

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,970
you perform project actions within your

00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:25,879
community so these are things like you

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:29,000
know how you know do we have elections

00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:29,600
how how is a project governed who owns

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,190
the tree

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,840
Mark's dough means how's all that

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,049
managed build systems and so on so

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:39,110
having opened transparent governance

00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:41,030
generally builds trust in your community

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,940
and I think really helps with growth and

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:46,000
adoption of projects we have a lot of

00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,830
examples for you to kind of learn from

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,059
there's really no kind of one way to do

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,429
this but if you go to open governance

00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,929
not Deb you could go look at you know

00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,950
some basic chat likes checklists and

00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,799
examples for you to kind of learn from

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,160
to add to your projects I truly wish

00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,659
github and get lab one day kind of adopt

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,580
some kind of standard around this where

00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:06,470
you kind of have a definition just like

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,059
you have a you know like since file

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,010
you know governance file becomes kind of

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,350
standard standard operating practice for

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,940
github other kind of things that we've

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,799
learned that you know generally has been

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,950
hard for a lot of companies that are new

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,990
to open source defaulting to open

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,820
communications for basically everything

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,679
so having public meeting minutes

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,510
recording meetings having them post it

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,429
on you know YouTube or whatever forum

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,570
open agenda is where anyone could kind

00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:33,950
of show up and contribute to the agendas

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,289
rotating kind of meeting coordinators so

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,299
people don't get burned out and so on I

00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,340
highly recommend looking at the

00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:43,850
kubernetes community for their kind of

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,470
guidelines of what they have done to

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,559
kind of deal with this problem

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,120
especially for community I've scaled you

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,169
know over time we have a lot of good

00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,179
practices in their code of conducts you

00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:57,799
know these things have become you know

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,590
standard practice now for the most part

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,179
which is great our advice here is don't

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,059
reinvent the wheel here there's some

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,230
great photo conducts out there from

00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:10,580
organizations like the contributor

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:13,190
covenant another kind of thing to share

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,740
is for the most part you generally don't

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,020
you know have issues over time but you

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,299
know when you know your end in terms of

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,000
time grows longer you're always going to

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:24,890
have your you know or bad actor

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,200
in the community and when you have that

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,039
being able deal of that situation is

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,230
challenging right and I highly recommend

00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,059
potentially having your community or

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,309
company organization look at code of

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,080
conduct incident you know training and

00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,940
response there's a couple companies out

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,320
there that do that I just winked one of

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,029
them but it's super useful to kind of

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,340
test drive

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:50,679
your process the other important thing

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:53,659
to share here is essentially having your

00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,450
community and project police itself

00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:59,599
versus you know an independent mediator

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,979
is probably best practice it essentially

00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,889
you know have your community be

00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:06,469
responsible in terms of deciding what is

00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:10,549
proper conduct and so on is is kind of a

00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:11,989
better practice for us you know this one

00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,029
you know should be obvious these days

00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:15,200
but you know some new projects that I

00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:17,029
worked at the Linux foundations a little

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,080
bit surprising that some people don't

00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:22,609
have a public driven community see ICD

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,830
system generally you know when we

00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:27,999
started the communities in C&C F in the

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,919
beginning you know kubernetes CI and CD

00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,539
actually was still kind of somewhat

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,039
owned by Google at the time so generally

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:35,779
for complex setup it takes time to kind

00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,059
of make this whole process community

00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,859
driven but these days it's significantly

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,869
easier with things like you know actions

00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:45,349
circle CI there's just a ton of you know

00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:48,049
great CI CD tools out there but

00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:49,909
essentially giving people access that

00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:53,509
they could you know a contribute to this

00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:54,679
maintain this and so on it is crucially

00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:58,330
as important just as you know

00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:00,499
maintaining you know the the source code

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,940
acknowledging contributors you know this

00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:04,099
sounds a little bit silly but you know

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,309
one thing we've done for a long time is

00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,899
for you know people that contribute

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,919
something to kubernetes we would

00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:15,619
basically send them a contributor patch

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,359
you know for them to kind of put on

00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,759
their laptop or a long piece of clothing

00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,799
but generally rewarding and

00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,539
acknowledging contributors first time

00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,940
for aviation community is something that

00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:27,679
we've seen just pays dividends over the

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,269
long term and you know it could be as

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,450
simple as acknowledgment on a website

00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:34,249
but you know do something in a way where

00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:37,580
people kind of feel special

00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:40,580
contributing in your in you know to your

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:44,330
community you know other kind of cool

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:47,210
things we've done in the past you know

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,549
our build landscapes so in C&C F we

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,940
built this tool essentially that

00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:56,059
displays the overall landscape projects

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,740
and adopters in our community we've done

00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,450
this for

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,640
idea projects mostly in the Linux

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,630
Foundation but it's a super useful way

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,160
for you to go

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,800
you know the scene step one is

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,730
definitely a little excessive

00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,200
here because we have a larger complex

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,150
you know community with projects from

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,940
all different sides but it's generally

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:19,010
super easy for us to kind of highlight

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,530
and filter our projects and members in

00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:24,050
the ecosystem you know you could filter

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,370
by you know hey now which projects and

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,950
companies come from China it's very

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,050
simple to filter you go see you know the

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,490
market cap of said companies that's a

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,580
very detailed thing and super kind of

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,960
useful thing that we recommend for folks

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,300
it doesn't have to be complex we have

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,000
some other communities like graph QL to

00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,610
have much simpler you know landscapes

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,570
but it's something that we find super

00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,420
useful on something we generally

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:51,700
recommend now for projects that kind of

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:54,010
have a good ecosystem component to it

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,720
another thing that should be straight

00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,220
obvious for folks is you know look as I

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,420
mentioned before communities don't come

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,420
for free so having things like

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,730
conferences meetups and so on or super

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,590
useful I have a little graph here that

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,470
kind of shows when we started our

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:12,020
kubernetes conferences and cloud native

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,730
conferences back in 2015

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,340
you know we had about 500 or so people

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,500
show up you know last year we had over

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,059
twenty thousand people so you know these

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,880
things tend to grow over time but in

00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:24,500
general you know it's not that hard for

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,570
you know someone that hosts a meet-up

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,940
you know out there but it's you know

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,429
just reminder that it's important to not

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,950
only invest in the building of said

00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:36,110
software but also the kind of community

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,650
growth and community management of a

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:42,760
piece of code internationalization you

00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,740
know we've seen a lot of success with

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,850
international localization you know we

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:52,400
essentially saw a fundamental you know

00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:54,170
increase in contributions to kubernetes

00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,600
when we enabled the site for

00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,280
translations you know and there's a lot

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,230
of different tools out there to do this

00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,090
depending what you use there's you know

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:05,000
Mozilla has built stuff there's sanada

00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,350
there's you know third-party companies

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,510
you kind of work with it's just a

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,490
fundamental easy thing that you could do

00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,660
that generally when you start your

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,970
project it's easier

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,610
to have the interrelation localization

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,990
kind of ached in versus trying to go you

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,910
know do that

00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,290
you know after you have you know some

00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,630
major releases it definitely took us a

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,180
lot of work to perform that in

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,590
kubernetes because initially when we you

00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,850
know built out the kubernetes site it

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,900
was not built for internationalization

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:34,730
and it was a bit of a nightmare to had

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,040
to do that but eventually it definitely

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,470
paid dividends once we did it

00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,110
internships you know one common

00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,990
complaint you know we have from projects

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,550
are that you know we would love more

00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,460
maintainer as we'd love people outside

00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:52,100
our company to come contribute you know

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,520
we found a huge amount of success in

00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,540
having our own internships programs or

00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,130
participating with efforts like Google

00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,470
Summer of Code which is about to kick

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,300
off even the Linux Foundation has a free

00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,280
internship mentoring platform community

00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,880
a bridge which allows you to kind of

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,790
match mate

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,550
projects mentors and mentees and be able

00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:13,370
to pay them basically anytime so this is

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:16,220
just one of the most useful things I

00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,290
think you could do for your project and

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,680
one interesting thing is after doing

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:25,190
this for a few years in CNC F in

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,740
particular we've had folks that have you

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,290
know basically started out as a intern

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,970
you know that worked on a project that

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,440
eventually they became a maintainer on

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,560
that project which eventually led to

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,430
full-time jobs related to that project

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,650
where they didn't worked on that project

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,480
full-time where they you know had their

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,190
first job in the industry and to me

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,640
that's just like incredibly rewarding

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,320
and super useful when it comes to you

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,360
know your community because these people

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,710
will take that experience and

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,170
potentially that project to new

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,610
companies that they join and potentially

00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,600
get them to adopt it which generally

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:01,490
just helps the overall ecosystem for you

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,500
another kind of cool thing that I

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,580
recommend that is possible now that

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,220
hasn't really been possible in the past

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,320
is automating things like license

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,480
scanning you know this used to be a more

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,790
laborious effort back in the day but

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,710
with tools like snick fossa pathology

00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,110
you could basically make license

00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,220
scanning and part of your build process

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,380
highly recommend you check out tools

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,710
like this it's just it just makes life a

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,500
lot easier than kind of manually doing

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,810
this to kind of

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,990
developers in the early days if they

00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:33,120
make any mistakes you know another kind

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,770
of legal thing to discuss is we're huge

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,350
fans of the developer certificate of

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,270
origin over things like clas you know

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,580
there are we you know justifications to

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:44,460
have a CLA but D CEO could definitely

00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,230
longer the barrier of entry when it

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,810
comes to people that contribute to a

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,660
project whereas CLA generally has to you

00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,890
know go to legal department or you know

00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,930
get some of its signing authority to

00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,410
sign that document and just deals with a

00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,430
lot of essentially you know churn that

00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,860
you have to go through to kind of get

00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:05,340
someone to contribute the project DCO

00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,690
provides a you know set of legal

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,970
protections with a little bit lower

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,040
barrier of entry projects like you know

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:14,310
linux you know use this and it's a

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,110
fairly successful you know legal

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,780
practice that many people aren't aware

00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:21,450
of and on the bright side github and

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,179
other even get lab has basically bots

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,770
that check for DCO these days so it just

00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,429
makes it super easy for you to kinda

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,389
implement in your projects other kind of

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,450
cool things

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:36,570
security disclosure process anytime your

00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:39,149
project gets any sign of success long

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,159
term you'll basically have to create

00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:42,360
something like this on the bright side

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,790
if you're using github

00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,419
they now have some you know nice built

00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:50,190
in mechanisms to kind of help define a

00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,800
security disclosure process release

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:55,169
process and also promote security

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,870
advisories through an API and

00:34:55,169 --> 00:35:00,060
programmatic way for folks there's a lot

00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,280
of examples out there if you just search

00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,470
security MV across github you could see

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,570
some examples out there but this is

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,280
something that I recommend folks do

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,190
earlier than later especially if you

00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,890
have if you really truly want to invest

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,210
in building a long term projects there

00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,340
are third-party tools out there like

00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:20,100
hacker one that can help you know kind

00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,190
of you define this if you're looking for

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,690
a more of kind of a paid offering as I

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,610
mentioned before just like license

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,230
scanning a lot of security tooling these

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,960
days is quote-unquote shifting left

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,720
where you know you're able to both scan

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,480
for security issues at you know

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,190
development time and build time you know

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,940
now so there's a lot of tools out there

00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,220
from

00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,599
you know vendor as I've mentioned before

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,599
there's also fuzzers out there which are

00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,369
becoming a more common thing but

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,040
anything you kind of do to kind of

00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:52,980
include these types of tools within your

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,980
project shows benefits we found tons of

00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,730
issues within CN CF projects like

00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,020
kubernetes envoy and so on by fuzzing

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:04,109
you know fuzzing them so highly

00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,030
recommended another kind of interesting

00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:08,030
practice that you know is think it's

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,990
kind of new to open source land is

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,609
security audits you know generally these

00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,349
are things that you know companies have

00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:15,329
historically done for products and

00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,990
things they've done but one practice

00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:20,490
that we've been doing within CN CF is

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,130
performing you know and hiring

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,720
third-party firms to do security audits

00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,910
and our open source projects and also

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,710
open source and share all the results

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,589
you know from you know the tools they

00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,319
use to any threat models they've built

00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:35,190
there's a great set of vendors that are

00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:37,829
starting to do this and are a little bit

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,950
more familiar with open source projects

00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,819
highly recommend you check them out

00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,710
there's an effort we have under the

00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,930
Linux Foundation called asked if Mozilla

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,520
has a mozilla security effort that's

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,230
been doing a lot of audits on open

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,390
source stuff so it's a good kind of

00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,119
lists of examples you kind of learn from

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,500
it's something that is not the cheapest

00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,079
thing in the world but it is a very

00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,720
high-value activity because a it

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,130
improves you know the quality of the

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,770
project generally because you know a lot

00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,660
of times we've had issues where we've

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,730
had a project that may have defined a

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,170
securely disclosure project in CN CF but

00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,210
they've never actually had a security

00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,829
bug reported and this was kind of one

00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,970
way to kind of guarantee that happens so

00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:17,130
it's kind of a good way to kind of

00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,829
battle test your your process too so

00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,349
hugely usually recommended practice and

00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:24,569
then kind of finally before I take

00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:27,420
questions for the last like 20 minutes

00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:30,270
or so is I think it's important to note

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,369
that you know all open source projects

00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,200
you know have a life cycle just like any

00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:36,690
product you know not every project is

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,849
going to be successful on you know some

00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,109
me you know never grow to a size of like

00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:41,640
a kubernetes and Linux but it's

00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:43,920
important to understand that you should

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,950
kind of allocate your resources a little

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,210
bit differently as projects are in a

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,829
different thing when you're launching a

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,390
project you obviously want to invest in

00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:52,680
community management building a little

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,290
bit of marketing for

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,970
as you know the kind of you know the

00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,440
growths the further kind of

00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,300
commercialization and maintaining and

00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,190
archiving stages in the projects so just

00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,500
something to kind of remind people and

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,940
think about a lot of times people tend

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,520
to treat open-source projects different

00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,800
from products in general I find them

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,510
very you know similar in in terms of

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,579
life cycles and and so on so it's just

00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,470
something to kind of keep in mind and

00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,260
you know not every open-source project

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,180
turns you know out to be a huge success

00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,160
so potentially it's something you should

00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,349
look at archiving and so on and we have

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,510
a great to do Who Cried on kind of how

00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:30,720
to archive and sunset projects of

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,910
Yannick get to that situation so that's

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,579
basically it you know I'd love to kind

00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,290
of take any questions you know from

00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,960
folks but kind of like summarize things

00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,220
is you know there's really kind of no

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,140
one-size-fits-all approach when it comes

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,940
to open source projects or open source

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,300
programs or really kind of custom-built

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,010
for the company or community you know

00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,750
and you know the lesson I've kind of

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,329
always shared for companies I've

00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:57,630
consulted with or worked with is you

00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:59,579
know truly contribution is the currency

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,609
and open source and if you don't have

00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:05,190
contribution to projects you can't

00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:07,140
influence them so if you're depending on

00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,849
all this software find a way to kind of

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,460
insert yourself so you kind of influence

00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:13,740
these things to a direction that

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,299
benefits you and if you're interested in

00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,470
learning more from kind of companies

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:19,020
that are going through this I highly

00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:21,119
recommend you take a look at joining the

00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,799
t2 group we have a slack and a bunch of

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,349
guides and stuff on github that you kind

00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:27,390
of contribute to you so that kind of

00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:30,390
wraps things up if you know I'd love to

00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,520
kind of take any questions you know from

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,910
folks to kind of make the last you know

00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,780
15 20 minutes interactive but if not you

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:42,329
could find me online CRA on Twitter and

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,910
Sienna Zak or CRA at Linux Foundation at

00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:47,430
org if you wanna catch up over email so

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:50,010
I hope you learned something new today

00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,990
and thank you for the finis folks gab

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:55,049
and Aaron for inviting me to share some

00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,940
thoughts today so happy to take

00:39:55,049 --> 00:40:02,690
questions depending how you want to do

00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:06,119
this let me go find mine thank you Chris

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,609
there was a lot of a lot of material in

00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,160
in

00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:15,369
forty minutes so we have folks on the

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,349
call with questions remember please to

00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:23,410
unmute yourselves if you have any

00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:25,210
questions for Chris before you do I was

00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:29,650
going to say that I've just posted the

00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:31,779
slides from our LinkedIn page and at the

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,480
bottom of the chat if you find the chat

00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:39,339
like Christine earlier plus all the

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,980
links are in the chat so I have one

00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:46,119
question from your experience with TV

00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:50,019
group and working with you know working

00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:52,089
with companies on their sort of journey

00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:55,690
toward toward an effective open-source

00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:57,339
program office because you know in the

00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,549
financial services industry you sort of

00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:03,910
see collected on this call here the

00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:07,119
folks who are who are pushing hard in

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,489
that direction in this industry and you

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,450
know we see see is the sort of same

00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:16,150
pattern repeating from firm to firm

00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,910
about just how you know where folks get

00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,009
started and how they progress from you

00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:25,119
know maybe their first open source

00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:27,539
project to having a good source program

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:32,109
that can sort of process a number of

00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:35,349
open source contribution requests at a

00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:37,989
time and and just sort of manage things

00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:40,269
at scale I'm just wondering whether you

00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:44,109
have any thoughts on sort of where you

00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:49,119
see common common mistakes or pitfalls

00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:52,239
or you know how folks can can be sure

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,339
that they're sort of headed in the right

00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,220
direction with putting together their

00:41:54,339 --> 00:42:00,549
open source programs yeah I mean you

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:03,400
know as I mentioned sorry muted myself

00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:05,170
as I mentioned before you know I think

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,180
for the financial industry you know just

00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,880
like any other industry you know the

00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:12,309
lessons learned are you know a having

00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:16,180
you know someone owned the problem

00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:19,960
full-time is generally important with

00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:22,300
full kind of buy-in from you know

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,900
executive team that you know open-source

00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,960
is something important you know outside

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,430
of just you know purely compliance which

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,200
is you know kind of had a lot of open

00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:35,680
source programs have historically chart

00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:39,310
started and essentially defining the

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:42,099
metrics for the success of that program

00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:44,560
whether you know a lot of a lot of times

00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,390
if you're you know I you know engineer

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,490
or building a product you know you know

00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:51,760
your team is gonna be defining a set of

00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:55,240
KPIs Karos you know whatever you want to

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,760
call them you know doing that exact same

00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,160
thing for your open-source program and

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,390
getting you know concrete agreement

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,530
amongst all the stakeholders your

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,540
company I think is important to kind of

00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,640
show the value and you know deciding

00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,869
what those metrics are for all your

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,430
organization's are important depending

00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:11,230
on what they do so I don't know if in

00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,890
you know financial firms like you know

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:18,160
maybe ensuring that you know you know we

00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:20,710
have no compliance you know incidents or

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,839
you know any responses the open-source

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,810
program you know are handled within a

00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:28,480
certain SLA you know an engineer could

00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:31,030
consume open-source and get approval to

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,800
do something within you know 24 hours or

00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:36,490
40 hours so essentially defining those

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,050
metrics sharing them having buy-in from

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,570
everyone and just having that publicly

00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,890
available inside the company I think is

00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,490
kind of something I've seen that helps

00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:47,710
is health the success for a lot of

00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,450
people starting out so you know short to

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,609
find the metrics and having that kind of

00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,900
you know dashboard available just just

00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:56,170
like any other kind of engineering

00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,240
effort within a company so I I know if

00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,609
that fully answers your question Aaron

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,960
but that's kind of you know from what

00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:03,609
I've noticed isn't sure that someone

00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,990
owns the problem you define your core

00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:06,520
set of metrics just like you have any

00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,530
other projects and company and make

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,530
those fully accessible

00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:28,520
I'm gonna ask another one then so again

00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:31,910
steamy was the topic of open source

00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,040
program offices you know I think the

00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:37,220
first step that a lot of the companies

00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,800
on the line take is to get their get

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,540
their compliance house in order you know

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,750
make sure that they they're tracking you

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:49,190
open source they're using and then maybe

00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:50,840
they'll do a a you know a pilot of open

00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,660
sourcing something of their own even

00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,750
before they get into contributing a lot

00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:01,160
to external projects but you know as

00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:04,280
companies are looking to to begin making

00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,110
their first contributions to external

00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,510
open source projects I think there's a

00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:13,220
there's this sort of idea that maybe

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:16,670
that is in some ways you know increasing

00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:19,090
and a higher risk activity than either

00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:22,490
you know consuming open source or

00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,930
sourcing their own projects and and you

00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:28,010
know often the first steps there are

00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:32,450
tentative have any any thoughts on how

00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:36,440
to sort of go from you know how to make

00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:39,080
your first contributions to the world at

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,880
large and then how to how to scale that

00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,400
up so that you know you're sort of

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,220
enabling your development organization

00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,320
to participate fully in open source sure

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,380
I think I think the first step would be

00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,710
basically cataloguing and indexing all

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,970
of you know kind of the open source you

00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,920
know you're using so you have an

00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,470
understanding of you know what you

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,750
potentially may want to contribute to

00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:05,900
and also understanding you know it's

00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:07,850
interesting from my time looking you

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,250
know a Twitter which was you know a

00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:13,040
couple thousand you know engineers you

00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:17,740
know size organization after doing that

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:22,010
indexing effort the amount of duplicated

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,810
forks and just you know projects that

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,610
you know you know just different

00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,350
versions of all sorts of crazy stuff

00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,380
that was out there that the evidence of

00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,670
program basically helped you know

00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,110
catalog and work with teams to

00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,780
understand well this

00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,430
you know is using you know Redis for key

00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,780
value services memcache you know maybe

00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:41,720
you should go standardize one and then

00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:44,510
contribute to just one of those upstream

00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,430
has kind of been a very kind of useful

00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,460
activity for an open source program and

00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:51,170
and the other thing is I think when

00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:55,280
these companies start contributing

00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:58,250
there's there's more trusted places to

00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,080
contribute than others so you know

00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,120
there's a lot of organizations out there

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,500
and particularly source foundations

00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,680
folks like you know the Apache

00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,690
foundation Eclipse Linux Foundation set

00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,810
of projects generally have very strong

00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:14,300
you know IP policies and maturity about

00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:16,820
them versus just some random you know

00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,350
library you have on github so basically

00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:23,510
coming up with essentially you know a

00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:26,060
whitelist or some type of levels out

00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:29,240
there where you know hey you know these

00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,090
areas are safe you know potentially to

00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,310
contribute versus others I've seen as a

00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:36,980
fairly kind of successful way to kind of

00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,880
ease towards towards folks and

00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,730
essentially it's interesting because

00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,220
sometimes that causes engineering teams

00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,750
to make decisions on what open-source

00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,090
software or to adopt like they may

00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,250
choose something out of a you know a

00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:52,580
well trusted foundation versus just

00:47:49,250 --> 00:48:00,890
something they find on kiddo so there's

00:47:52,580 --> 00:48:03,080
a couple things I've seen here can you

00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:07,370
talk more about the major difference

00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:11,090
between the DCO and the CLE yeah I mean

00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:13,160
so that's so DCO is is very much

00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:17,780
extremely standardized rate and that

00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:21,200
basically tells let me go to find let me

00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:24,110
go to my slide basically DCO is

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,900
basically guaranteeing that the

00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:29,060
contribution that you received from

00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,950
someone is something they have the right

00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,020
to submit to they basically wrote it

00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,430
themselves they didn't copy it from you

00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,250
know yadda yadda this is all kind of

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:40,940
came from the experiences from the skill

00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:42,920
lawsuit back in a day clas are a lot

00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,410
more variable because there is not one

00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,430
standard type of CLA or there's

00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,779
different ones

00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,369
there's you know there's something like

00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:51,680
the Apache CLA which exists that a lot

00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:53,450
of company is used but there's also clas

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,880
out there that do copyright assignment

00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,250
and other kind of legal nefarious things

00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,460
clas generally are things that require

00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,900
you know someone with you know legal

00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,970
authority and your company to decide is

00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:07,460
like a process right it's actually makes

00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:10,640
the barrier for contribution much higher

00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,200
but you know versus like ADC which is

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,960
essentially just requires a developer to

00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:19,270
kind of sign off within get each commit

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:23,240
git commit dash S is fairly simple so

00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:25,520
the CLA the CLA doesn't give the same IP

00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,000
protection the DCO doesn't give the same

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,490
IP protection as CLA right it depends on

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,099
the CLA a lot of clas will have language

00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:35,930
in them like I said I certify that I

00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:38,299
write this contribution myself I didn't

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:40,730
copy it from anywhere so you know you

00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:44,779
can almost view clas that has been a

00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:47,750
subset of what is specified in a DC o

00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:49,819
with with more potential things around

00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,950
copyright assignment or other stuff like

00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:54,380
there is no standard CLA so it's kind of

00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:57,260
a hard hard thing they tend to be kind

00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,029
of custom depending on community that

00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,950
you're working with you know open source

00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:03,640
foundations there CLA tend to be very

00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,869
kind of fair more straightforward

00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,630
companies that tend to have CLA are

00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:10,279
usually protecting themselves you know

00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,819
if they have an open source product that

00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:13,760
they're building

00:50:10,819 --> 00:50:16,309
maybe they require you know a license or

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,900
even assignment to all the copyright

00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:22,190
associated so I find D cos as fairly a

00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,619
lightweight mechanism to kind of get you

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:27,859
a lot of the typical legal guarantees

00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:30,380
that you truly care about in a project

00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:32,569
especially paired with a patent friendly

00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,510
license like an Apache if you point to

00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:43,069
point O type type style license okay

00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:46,609
thank you Chris of course

00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:49,489
can you hear me well very well Reza hi

00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:53,839
and this is um um Reza Alavi I'm working

00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:58,160
with open source we protein source

00:50:53,839 --> 00:51:01,969
global practice I'm actually quite new

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:06,819
to open source and my background is

00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:10,279
security risk and governance and we I

00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:15,469
was asked to be engaged in one of the

00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:17,660
clients vaporous client in in the UK the

00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:21,650
subjects I know the question I want to

00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:24,170
ask the subjects may not really be lots

00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:27,890
of open source folks may not like the

00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:30,859
question itself but I'm also a part of a

00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:34,190
risk management committee more than one

00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:38,299
in a British Standard institution vsi as

00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,609
part of our global practice one of the

00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:42,380
first things I've noticed when I started

00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:44,359
my involvement with open source

00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:50,059
governess I've realised there was no

00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:52,519
written standard or a framework it's at

00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:57,170
something which in other practice you

00:51:52,519 --> 00:52:01,640
refer to so if you deal if you do I -

00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:06,140
governess you refer to ISO 3/8 500 you

00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,819
we do data quality you refer to ISO 8004

00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,660
--the you didn't have to but there are

00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:17,589
frameworks available for for for various

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:21,920
practices in security and risk as you I

00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:25,309
am I also took initiative I - what in

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,209
one of the rm1 committees about six

00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:30,559
seven months ago

00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:33,499
I presented an open source from a

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:37,150
governance and risk perspective for them

00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:41,209
the risk management perspective to

00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:45,440
explain to them the deficiencies in in

00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:48,979
industry and how reluctance some of the

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,479
some of organizations are to get engaged

00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:52,869
with open source governance and

00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:56,060
management because there is no specific

00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:57,980
written standard a framework

00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:02,300
there are lots of them available as as

00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:06,940
as I've learned you know you guys know

00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:12,670
more than me but I've just seen a lot

00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:18,200
but my current current project I had to

00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,860
borrow stuff from various standards of

00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,310
frameworks

00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:26,210
I used copies for instance for certain

00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:31,970
elements and also 8000 do you think

00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:37,820
though if there is a appetite and and

00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:40,840
also it's a need at all to to create a

00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:46,490
working group as part of global I it's a

00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:51,110
standard or BSI in in the UK in in order

00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:53,780
to bring and experts and expertise from

00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:55,750
it various parts of open-source but

00:53:53,780 --> 00:54:00,430
there is a compliance or risk or

00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:03,290
security and creates a kind of

00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:06,970
open-source champions for standards

00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:10,700
something like that to give a coherent

00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:12,980
framework which everyone can refer to

00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,580
like oh if you want to do cybersecurity

00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:20,200
go to NIST or cloud security do this in

00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:22,960
that we do you think that's something

00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:26,930
achievable or do you think this is

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:34,370
considering the open source community

00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:37,280
globally that the the the politics or

00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,720
mechanism in in that community do you

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,590
think this is this is something

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,510
achievable or doable what do you think

00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:47,120
about this I think I mean I think

00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:50,420
everyone basically will come yeah I

00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:52,070
think it's not it's not a bad idea to

00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,600
have you know what you would

00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:55,190
traditionally have like Isis standards

00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,430
for a variety things and so people could

00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:01,370
leverage and use them but I find in open

00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:03,230
source their almost you know there's

00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,200
almost a desire to kind of build things

00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:07,670
on your own it's kind of like yeah I was

00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,960
like at IKEA effect if you kind of build

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,339
a guru and you kind of feel better about

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,069
it

00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:13,329
cultivate on your own so you know for CN

00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:14,950
CF we have a lot of projects that they

00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:16,719
craft their own governance like there's

00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,099
no one way to kind of do it so they do

00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,269
it on their own and then when they do it

00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:19,779
they kind of feel good about it because

00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:21,579
it's theirs

00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:23,680
it's they're a little you know thing

00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:26,769
that they built and so on but there

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:30,039
could be there could be standards for

00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:34,299
things around you know what it means to

00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:36,249
be a good like secure project or you

00:55:34,299 --> 00:55:37,569
know good open source project like I'm

00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,979
sharing my screen right now we have

00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:42,130
something called like the best practices

00:55:38,979 --> 00:55:44,109
effort from CII which a lot of projects

00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:47,349
go to and they're essentially you know

00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:49,420
like a checklist of things you know what

00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:51,549
a good project should have from like

00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,529
working build system automated tests we

00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:57,309
all do all this stuff so like I think

00:55:53,529 --> 00:56:00,479
there is opportunities to you know

00:55:57,309 --> 00:56:03,450
develop stuff like this but generally

00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:07,479
open-source developers prefer a more

00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:09,400
automated you know type approach to

00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:11,829
things if you can they do tend to not

00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,809
you know that they ignore you know

00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:14,859
standards as much as possible at least

00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:16,299
from my experience at least the

00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:21,130
communities I tend to work with which

00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:23,410
gonna be a little bit accepted one one

00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:25,710
one one of our one of our colleagues

00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:30,130
who's been in open-source

00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:37,509
ecosystem for last 2025 years thirty

00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:39,130
years and and he said he hated that's

00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:42,039
why I just this is the first time I'm

00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:44,650
actually asking this question and this

00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:48,670
from this audience and I'm more than

00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:51,039
happy to have further conversation if if

00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:54,729
you or Aaron or and Robbie you think

00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:57,670
that's that that's something I mean you

00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:59,829
guys can facilitate or you think it

00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:03,519
could be something out of this

00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:05,529
conversation comment knowledge sharing

00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,599
is always always good understanding

00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:09,789
people's perspectives and problems and

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,140
and what they've dealt with and sharing

00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:12,700
what we've learned is they get super

00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:17,859
useful so I'm always happy to have a

00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:20,589
conversation that would be that would be

00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:23,549
great if we have that conversation in

00:57:20,589 --> 00:57:23,549
separate

00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:31,410
yeah I don't I don't have a your access

00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:35,900
email at listen we can we can set up

00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,900
something and have a conversation now

00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:41,490
all right we are at the end of the hour

00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,800
so I want to give a hearty thank you to

00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:45,690
Chris and a sick no Anna Schick

00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,030
apologies for mispronouncing it before

00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:50,700
right of the cloud native computing

00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:53,910
foundation of the Linux Foundation and

00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:55,740
thank to everyone who who showed up was

00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:57,180
a terrific presentation I hope everyone

00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,190
got a lot out of it
