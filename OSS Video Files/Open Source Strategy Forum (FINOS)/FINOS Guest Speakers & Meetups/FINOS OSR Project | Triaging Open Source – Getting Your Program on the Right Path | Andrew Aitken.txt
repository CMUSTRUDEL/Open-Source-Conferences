[Music]

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,970
and I'm Erin Williamson I'm the

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,090
open-source readiness lead here at finis

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,490
and without further ado I'll go ahead

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,420
and turn it over to Andrew akin who is

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,679
GM and global open-source practice lead

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:35,579
at Wipro technologies and you're doing

00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,870
all right thanks Erin so I definitely

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,510
want to make this an interactive

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,239
presentation please interrupt with

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,110
questions or comments and I'm happy to

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:50,129
get additional input the content today

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,989
is is really about how to be a triage

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,340
your open source program how to get your

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,840
program on the right track so you can

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,360
actually get to the important stuff

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:03,000
which is realizing the benefits of open

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,060
source and I love feedback and input

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,400
from the team I not going to try and do

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,189
this exhaustively that that would be a

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,530
good full-day conversation but I want to

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,229
really really sat down and thought about

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,270
you know over the 200 engagements that

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,310
myself and my team have done what are

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,990
some of the common lessons learned what

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,970
are some of the common experiences we've

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,259
had what are some you know what are some

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,869
of the best practices that we've been

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,229
able to extract from this and wanted to

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,299
share that but again we'd love to get

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,950
input from some people in the call so I

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:45,210
hope this is a bit of a two-way

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:47,820
conversation so briefly let's see just a

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:57,540
second I cannot seem to move from the

00:01:47,820 --> 00:02:00,450
first slide there we go oops so for

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,180
those of you who don't know who Wipro is

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,700
were one of the large global systems

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,390
integrators over 8 billion in revenue

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,310
about 172 thousand employees

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:16,310
I believe in over a thousand active

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,900
enterprise-class clients from a more

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,940
relevant from an open source perspective

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,000
we have well over twenty five thousand

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,370
developers working on open using and

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,780
working on open source projects we're

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,820
very very active in the open source

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,750
community and that's growing we were

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:36,980
deeply engaged in 20-plus projects and

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,560
foundations today and we've completed in

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,660
the last couple years over a thousand

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,910
specific open source projects wrote

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,540
again for large global enterprises so we

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,340
have but we're pretty good a pretty good

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,050
focus on an open source where the first

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,510
global systems integrator to actually

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,700
instantiate an open-source dedicated

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,470
practice and so a lot of the information

00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,209
is coming from the lessons we've learned

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,840
and the clients has worked with in this

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,840
context

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,120
seemed to be a delay in moving slides

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,209
not sure what that's about

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,780
there we go so what are we what I'm

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,640
really talking about today this is the

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,530
technical definition of triage assigning

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,060
degrees of urgency wounds or illnesses

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,970
to decide the order of treatment that's

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,870
a little dramatic for our conversation

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,180
and I've extrapolated that really to to

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,159
what it means to me from an open source

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,170
perspective so it's really it's about

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,909
defining and sequencing activities to

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,239
determine and reduce the real and or

00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,650
perceived compliance and security issues

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,900
related to the use of an undetermined

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,840
amount and type of open source and again

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,849
it's really that did you do all that in

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,579
order to build and implement plans to

00:03:49,849 --> 00:04:00,409
realize the actual benefits of open

00:03:52,579 --> 00:04:02,480
source so we're we're focusing on

00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,530
financial services today most of the

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,900
information that I'm going to share with

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,730
you is related to our financial services

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,319
clients that we work that we're working

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,720
with privately and over the last few

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,940
years and as we're probably aware

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,090
there's a huge amount of enthusiasm for

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,269
open source and financial services but

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,760
there's also a degree of in some cases

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,880
what I might call naivete or simply just

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,919
a of of experience or knowledge and

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,410
these are actual quotes that we've

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,750
gotten from that we've heard from our

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,370
clients again to that point on

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,710
enthusiasm we've one client is that they

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,900
wanted to open source a few dozen

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,460
applications and but really didn't

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,479
understand why we recommend that they go

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,370
look at github first at the end of the

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,740
day there was three or four of the

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,060
applications that that they wanted to

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,620
open source it hadn't almost been

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,039
completely replicated within within

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,840
github and one of the more interesting

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,669
comments we've had is this application

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,349
assess that they're talking about there

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,090
this is a bank is talking about an

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,139
internal application that assesses the

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,000
risk and impact the security

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,430
vulnerabilities in all their other

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,900
applications and they were completely

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,720
confident there was no open source in

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,070
this application it turned out they had

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,510
187 different open source components in

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:20,080
that one and my favorite is we asked the

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:23,379
community and they're talking about

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,409
a blanket email to an open-source

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,840
community and they asked for an SLA and

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,389
indemnification and they really could

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,969
not understand why no one replied to

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,680
them you know we're XYZ bank this is a

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,199
huge opportunity we want to use the

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,370
software but we have to have an SLA we

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,159
have to have them in the kitchen and

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,840
nobody's replying to us so again there's

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,580
a huge amount of enthusiasm for open

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,759
source and financial services but we

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:53,020
still have a bit of a ways to go to to

00:05:48,759 --> 00:06:03,430
really mature its use in financial

00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:05,110
services all right so we're talking this

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,590
is this can be kind of a complex issue

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,139
and we should talk a little bit about

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,879
where open source B comes from in an

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:15,580
enterprise and a financial services

00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,979
organization how is open source ingested

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,279
essentially what are the paths that open

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:23,229
source gets into the organization well a

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,319
lot of a lot of Meg's today are using

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,690
community open source so in production

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,770
some more in development and they sort

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,710
of that from communities from

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,680
foundations from publicly available

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,909
repositories many many of you use

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,370
commercial open source

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:44,050
oh let me let me finish that personal a

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,479
little bit so excuse me so the community

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,490
of the source is mostly unvetted and

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,020
what I mean by that is if it's not

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,879
necessarily been in the codes not

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,279
inserted and scanned there isn't

00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,960
necessarily a model by which they make

00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,719
sure that they're the software that

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,560
they're developing is free of their own

00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:08,469
IP issues or encumbrances one of the

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,779
challenges is there's this notion of

00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:13,240
declared versus undeclared licenses so a

00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:16,810
top-level project will have a declared

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,120
license but what is very common is that

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,520
developers will use other pieces of open

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,349
source to create this piece of open

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,479
source in those other pieces of open

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,969
source under a different license which

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,440
may or may not be declared so that's one

00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,810
of the challenges with with community

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,240
open source then we have commercial open

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,189
source which is mostly vetted

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,110
today but not completely if you're

00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,490
working with a lot of startup state they

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,059
don't necessarily even understand that

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,099
process but the commercial open source

00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:46,839
obviously comes with a ton of community

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,990
open source then we have proprietary

00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:53,020
software there's some great examples if

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,839
you look at sa P by their own by their

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,149
own designation they use a source of

00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,169
about 90 to 90 percent of the software

00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:04,719
they they built and the same can be said

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,300
for Oracle or Microsoft or many other

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,309
proprietary software vendors so and

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,649
again there's a relationship between the

00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:15,879
size of the vendor and the

00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:18,009
comprehensiveness of their own

00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,769
governance program if you look into

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,599
Microsoft or an s AP they have very very

00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,569
robust governance and compliance

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:27,610
programs in place but again as you as

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,769
you begin using software from smaller

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,430
proprietary software vendors you get a

00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:34,509
really mixed bag in typically

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,099
proprietary software vendors provide

00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,750
software to you that includes community

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,329
open sources and some third-party

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,810
licensed commercial open sources then we

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:45,819
have to spoke mostly unvetted you know

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,920
the software that you build or you

00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:49,630
contract to have built and it can also

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,660
include community open source and

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,009
commercial open source and then software

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,720
you require through your partners

00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:58,930
whether they be independent software

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,290
vendors or sis like micro again mixed

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:05,829
vetting some have really good governance

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,689
programs some don'ts and it's challenge

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:10,209
to know which unless you explicitly ask

00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:11,709
them and again that software will come

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:21,339
with both community and commercial open

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:24,449
source in a study oops the study by

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:27,399
white source showed that the average

00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:31,870
opens the average application today

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:39,939
contains about 257 different components

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:42,939
the source components so if I if I had a

00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:44,410
nickel for every time I heard from our

00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:46,000
clients particularly I have to say in

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,920
financial services that they are a

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,470
highly

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,450
distributed organization and that our

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,310
typical approach to helping them build a

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,360
governance model wouldn't really be

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,950
appropriate because they're so

00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,269
distributed I would I could retire yes

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,160
financial services organizations are

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:05,220
very distributed and they are highly

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,070
complex organizations we understand that

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,990
in the conversation typically goes that

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,779
way we understand we built the models

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,339
that helps you that helps address the

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,110
distributed and complex nature of

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,910
financial services organizations and the

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,470
typical responses again yes but you

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,029
don't really understand how distributed

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,800
you are we really are what we've tried

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,060
to take that in consideration no no you

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,190
don't understand we're really really

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,589
really distributed and complex and so

00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:38,130
it's just not going to work we get it

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:42,079
this is how a typical enterprise looks

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:45,029
like if you can if you put them on a

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,949
maturity curve where you have you know

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,050
the lowest level of maturity is really

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:52,230
open sources is brought in through

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,930
ground up with few controls and it's

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,510
it's ad-hoc you move all the way up the

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,040
maturity curve to collaborate where

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,959
you're co-creating with the community to

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,880
add additional business value to the

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,029
organization or even you're driving

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,320
you're becoming a leader in the open

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,209
source buy publish on your own open

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,890
source or contributing actively to

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:17,070
communities so every organization is on

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:20,010
a maturity curve somewhere and it's a

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,709
really important to understand that in

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,360
your organization's you have different

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,600
lines of business that are in different

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,019
places on this on this maturity curve

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,170
you'll have functions HR legal

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,910
procurement that are on have different

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,459
understandings or different places on

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,199
this maturity curve and you have this

00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,850
and some organizations have this notion

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,040
of a shared services group or a shared

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,870
architecture group and again even within

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,420
that they will be with them they will be

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:54,600
on different different at different

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:58,230
stages of a maturity curve so this is

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:09,239
this is a typical plot for

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:13,110
an average enterprise today so it's got

00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:15,929
some some common attributes of

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,089
enterprises that are on this that are

00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,889
that are on this maturity curve and

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,660
these are some of the ones that that

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,629
we've really some common aspects that

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,329
we've been able to extract from our

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,459
experience one of the key trends is that

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,049
most organizations are recognizing that

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:34,410
open source is becoming a strategic

00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:36,569
asset and not just a set of tactical

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,220
components in your IT infrastructure and

00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:40,499
are beginning to think about how do we

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:47,610
treat it that way

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:49,290
there is a typically enterprises do not

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,869
understand how much open source they're

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,899
using where they're using it or how

00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:59,040
they're using it this the numbers here I

00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,509
share are from the recent engagement now

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,720
where clients thought they had 200

00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:06,449
components they didn't quick internal

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,220
analysis found out they reason 400 today

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,740
after working with them for a while and

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,019
we're well over 4,000 and that number is

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,629
probably going to continue to grow so

00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:20,100
the the average enterprise today is is

00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:22,649
certainly using in the thousands the are

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,350
the number of open source components the

00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:27,899
main issue that we see is really around

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,339
versioning so in some organizations will

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,889
want to particularly we found that they

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,309
were using software that was 12 versions

00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,589
old it's it's really common I would say

00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:39,629
to find organizations that are using

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:43,559
versions that are for the fluting and

00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:46,589
four to five versions old with unpatched

00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,240
security fixes that in our experience is

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:52,410
really at the end of the day this is

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,029
really the key issue we find the some

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,819
form of policy exists somewhere in the

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,769
organization but typically it's it's

00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,720
definitely not been uniformly

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:05,160
implemented neither has a process and

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,079
many organizations either have or

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,299
beginning to put together a program

00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,470
office and one of our one of them one of

00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,509
the things that we commonly know

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,850
HRP chairman and the developers

00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,769
themselves are actually overlooked in in

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,720
an awesome open-source program office

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,430
and these are these are important people

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,220
to engage in this process particularly

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,230
developers them and it's it's really

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,050
interesting that most organizations

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,939
don't have this notion of a developer

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,069
council or developer community with a

00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,899
representative into the open source

00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:38,040
program office we definitely recommend

00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:40,680
that so from a focused perspective

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,189
typically we see too much focus on

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,139
intellectual property issues yes it has

00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:48,089
to be addressed it's actually relatively

00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,829
straightforward to address and at the

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:52,110
end of day there really isn't too much

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:56,670
concern around I mean too much reality

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,170
around IP leakage we do see that there's

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,449
too much or an appropriate level of

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,480
focus on on security it depends where

00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:05,759
that's being driven from but sometimes

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,189
organizations focus so tightly on

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,829
security that again they they lose the

00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:14,519
overall benefit of consuming more and

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:16,019
more open source we do find typically an

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,930
appropriate appropriate focus on

00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,399
compliance light and in this instance

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,550
were talking about license compliance

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,860
because for enterprises it's not like an

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,779
OEM with someone manufacturing a handset

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,759
who's distributing a hundred different

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,730
applications mostly open source on their

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,649
handset to 100 million 100 million users

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:39,540
they have real real real compliance

00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:41,970
issues and concerns and liability in the

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,180
enterprise that's less of an issue and

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,000
so we see that that that is typically

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,220
fairly well governed we do see too

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,120
little focus on operational aspects and

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,410
this is this is really important because

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,529
you're going to be using more and more

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,600
open source over time that's just a

00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,550
given right open source is becoming more

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,250
important to software overall and

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,800
therefore it's can be become more

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,420
important to all of us and so there it's

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,009
really important that not only do you

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,290
put in place a governance program that

00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,689
protects you from licensing compliance

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,730
and security issues but a program that

00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:20,339
also addresses issues like how are you

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,499
going to manage this over a period of

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,719
time how are you going to

00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:26,639
bring in more open source efficiently

00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:28,019
how are you going to govern that open

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,399
source efficiently how are you going to

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,059
update it how is it going to be

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,279
supported so we really really recommend

00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,379
that people spend a lot of time focusing

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,349
on the operational aspects of open

00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,539
source and we also see too little focus

00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:47,549
on ease-of-use really and this really

00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:49,349
comes to the the process itself so as we

00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,599
know developers will look at any

00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:55,979
anything that competes their ability to

00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:58,099
write good quality software fast as a

00:16:55,979 --> 00:17:01,679
burden as another layer of bureaucracy

00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:04,620
and so we really recommend that you

00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,480
spend some time you get the architecture

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,449
teams together you get the teams

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,909
together you get the legal team from the

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,490
security teams together and really think

00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:17,250
through how can this be most efficiently

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,289
implemented to create the least

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,799
additional burden to our developer

00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,730
community those bottom two we spend we

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,600
recommend you spend as much time

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:33,990
thinking through as the rest or more and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,460
we see because of the ride the continued

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,649
rise of open source and the enterprise

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,179
we we definitely see a number of

00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:41,730
different when we get engaged with a

00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:45,750
number of different disconnected

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:48,450
activities it's funny as I putting this

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,619
together a few days ago it done to me

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,259
that we're actually engaged within the

00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:54,899
client that has a DevOps activity going

00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,649
on a shared shared services activity

00:17:54,899 --> 00:18:00,509
central architecture activity going on a

00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:02,789
security activity going on and the legal

00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:05,460
one all addressing various aspects of

00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:07,379
their own issues around open source and

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,580
none of them were talking to each other

00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:17,429
or barely knew each other so this is

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:20,039
more common than might be expected any

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,509
thoughts or comments here again I'd like

00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:30,139
to make this a bit bit of a two-way

00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:30,139
conversation okay

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,440
so over the years we've really thought

00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:39,679
through what what some of the core

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,570
elements of good governance look like

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,000
and we think of that from from kind of

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:48,450
two key aspects one is what are the core

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,399
components well the the core components

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,890
of governance really boils down to three

00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,840
things that's strategy defining the

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,370
business rationale objectives for why

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,630
you're using open source and going

00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,370
through this whole exercise and

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,120
investing the time and energy and

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,830
funding to do to go through this process

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,659
policy defining the rules and then

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,450
processes again how do we effectively

00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:14,940
implement automation into our DevOps our

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,279
dev environment to manage the use of

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,360
open source on an ongoing basis and then

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:26,820
further there are seven key dimensions

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,490
of that makeup and best practices around

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,770
governance it's how do you discover open

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,330
source and how does that open source get

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,190
approved how is it commercially procured

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,620
which is which can which includes supply

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,770
chain management how do we actually

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,580
manage the code and maintain it how do

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:51,270
we engage with the open source community

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:54,000
what is our license compliance model and

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,399
do we have executive sponsorship so all

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,500
of these are really key aspects of your

00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:01,830
open source management strategy your

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,840
policy in your processes and each one is

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,450
broken down into a variety of different

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,159
elements and aspects but you look at it

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,909
from that to have a successful program

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,340
it's important to take into

00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:17,539
consideration these these seven

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,539
dimensions of good governance

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:29,090
alright so the first step really is

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:30,650
about knowing where you are and how do

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,600
how do we recommend you you go about

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,150
doing that it's it's really start with a

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,220
start with a survey we recommend the

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,630
survey be cross functional recommend

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,610
that it be multiple choice to offer

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,830
response respondents wait the aspect of

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,780
having something be multiple choice gets

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,550
the respondents to think about the

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,170
question itself in more detail so what

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,540
we found rather than providing it you

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,250
know kind of a binary the answers and

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,830
I'll give an example and injustice like

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,640
here and we also recommend that it that

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:04,220
it be anonymous or offer to be anonymous

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,470
the you know we've looked at this pretty

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,050
carefully in the difference particularly

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,200
in the next step during the interview

00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:15,470
process speed between offering to be

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,050
anonymous in surveys that are not don't

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,620
have that option the depth and quality

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:25,310
of information and feedback is in some

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,950
instances substantially greater okay so

00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,210
step two is really doing qualitative

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,920
interviews and identifying key

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,510
stakeholders which include people from

00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,440
the different functions I mentioned

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:39,440
earlier and identifying key stakeholders

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,380
and going through a actual

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,830
person-to-person interview process and

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:49,010
addressing qualitative aspects of open

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:52,220
source usage and then the last the last

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:55,100
step to really rounding out your new

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,920
review of your internal view of where

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,980
you are today is really going through a

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:04,490
baseline set of scaling so greenfield

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,570
and legacy and to really get a picture

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,720
of where you are today

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,570
in the last part is you need to

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,600
determine which applications to put in

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,090
your ear sample scans to develop the

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,120
baseline not necessarily let the vendor

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,010
select those because they won't

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,770
necessarily have the insights into your

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:27,110
application portfolio in the attributes

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,060
of your applications that you do so we

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,670
recommend that again

00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,230
you as the end user of these

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,490
applications determine which one should

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,990
be should be included in a baseline scam

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,180
Andrea I have a question here I've had a

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,450
question from her from various

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:46,330
participants in this program before sort

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:50,080
of how to choose more how to go about

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:54,390
deciding which applications within the

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,700
sort of legacy portfolio to scan first

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,930
and sort of how to plan out you know how

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,390
you go through your backlog of

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,720
applications and do that scanning into

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,720
mediation

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,970
sure well a few of them are probably

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,590
obvious such as anything that's customer

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,350
facing you want to do you want to pick a

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,260
few of your more complex customer-facing

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,180
applications those applications where

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,120
customers may be inputting personal data

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,760
obviously you want to see what the what

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,800
the issues if there are issues around

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,460
open source and privacy so that's that's

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,660
one set if you're moving to a cloud

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,650
native architecture in other words

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,950
you're going through an internal

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,760
transformation we recommend picking some

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,140
of those apps that have already been

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:45,820
transformed as it were and I have become

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:48,510
a cloud hosted definitely scan a few of

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,640
those and then pick some of the older

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,870
pick some of the older legacy

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,040
applications where you're storing any

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,960
kind of customer data also it doesn't to

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,850
do a sample baseline scan you may want

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,130
to make sure that that you're covering

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,660
your lines of business you want to make

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,210
sure you're covering customer-facing

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,670
applications and those legacy

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,670
applications that again contain a lot or

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,830
any customer data that's kind of a cut

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,510
at which ones to pick and it doesn't

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,770
have to be you know we're not saying you

00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,720
put together a list in 40 different

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,090
applications you I don't think you need

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,040
that many it can be depending upon the

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:28,540
size and complexity application it can

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,980
be six eight applications okay so this

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,730
is a third of the cross section of your

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,600
interpret it really is important to get

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:39,720
across session

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,360
and at the end of the day you may make

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,050
the decision that you're going to let

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,700
your legacy portfolio be alone and not

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:53,580
try and scan everything and and

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,350
remediating it and you know that's

00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:00,390
that's just something you have to

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:02,700
determine I would say probably 25

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:06,960
percent of our clients want to get

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,760
everything scanned and 75% are just

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,120
focusing on new Greenfield applications

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,520
and and customer data in customer data

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,200
applications that contain customer data

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:26,130
and letting the older legacy

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:28,820
applications go then once you've done

00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:33,170
this the survey we recommend taking a

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,310
it's important to help visualize the the

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,230
where you are today and be able to

00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,720
convey that visually to the people

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,340
within the organization so it's you know

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,360
recommend putting together some form of

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,230
a chart doesn't have to be a spider

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,320
chart but this is output from an actual

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:52,350
client that worked with a while ago and

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,480
it shows where they are on managing

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,340
these the different aspects of that the

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,700
different dimensions of open source

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,310
governance so they need to expand we

00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,280
don't necessarily say you have to have

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:07,710
you have to cover that entire circle but

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,390
you should be farther out than this

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,240
organization is you should certainly be

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:14,550
farther into the green and blue

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:19,080
sometimes trying to reach that that last

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:20,880
stage is simply not it's it's not

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,820
necessarily what you're trying to

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,240
achieve as an organization to be and to

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:30,330
become an absolute leader and Driver and

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,980
visible member of the open-source

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,510
community that may not be your corporate

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,820
goals but your goals are to consume

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,860
relevant open source and to contribute

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,900
back and then maybe occasionally publish

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,570
your own and that's fine so setting your

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:46,640
goals on getting out to the the green

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,640
and the blue is can be perfectly accept

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:57,200
so this is an example of a type of

00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:00,170
question we recommend in the survey that

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,940
you should do so again this guy this is

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:06,980
how to developers in the organization

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:09,200
find and source open source and in ours

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,420
we actually have about six or seven more

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,760
pieces to this that's one question and

00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,040
what you're really trying to do by

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,170
providing it as multiple choice here is

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,730
get your developers this is a part of

00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,740
the acculturation process is getting

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,590
your developers and in any of the

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,300
respondents to think about how we're

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,490
using open source in your position why

00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,080
we're using open sources you've got to

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,330
realize that you want to ask you want to

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,890
survey people who really have not

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,900
thought about this you want to make sure

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,420
you're not you're not self selecting

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,830
your most knowledgeable audience you're

00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,750
trying to get broader than you're trying

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,770
to get it put input which is broader

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,150
than that you want to go beyond your

00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,710
your open source leaders in the

00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,630
organization you want to go beyond your

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,880
attorney who's an open source expert or

00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,210
your chief architect is who's an open

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,980
source expert tiller you know people at

00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,870
that type you want to get broaden it to

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,679
those who use open source but don't

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:06,970
really think about it too much okay and

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,230
so by giving them a multiple choice

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:17,840
question it helps them begin to thank

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:19,880
you that in a bit more detail so these

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,710
are aspects of open source governance

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,940
which we find are often overlooked if

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,950
some of you are going through this list

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,240
and saying hey we've incorporated every

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,910
one of these elements in our governance

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,390
program awesome congratulations kudos to

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,770
you but this is that key and you can be

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,630
proud that you're not typical you're

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:42,140
definitely on you know on the forward

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:44,750
edge of good governance but again these

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,700
are typical elements that are that are

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,190
definitely over often overlooked and I'm

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,070
going to go

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,050
a few of them so mmm build a business

00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,030
justification model it's not only this

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,710
isn't only just for your overall

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:58,740
enterprise-wide strategy but this is

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,500
kind of a decision tree type of approach

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,200
that you can make available to

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,390
developers who want to either consume

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,640
more open source or contribute or

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,210
publish it on open source so make it

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:16,470
easy for them to figure out if it makes

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,990
sense and this can be something as as

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,920
simple as a web-based survey with you

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,760
know eight or nine or ten different

00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,050
questions but build a model that helps

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,050
developers think through that process

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,910
and helps make it easy for your program

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,420
office or other leadership to make a

00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:35,280
decision on these on whether or not to

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,640
do something related do something in

00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,740
open source here clearly define your

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,080
operating model in your own version of

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,490
internal best practices and describe why

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,080
that's important to the organization

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,090
because what you're doing is you're

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,300
beginning to create your own open source

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:54,060
culture as we know many organizations

00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,860
today are trying to become more more of

00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,380
a tech company for a variety of reasons

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,940
and they view open source as a catalyst

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,670
to do so in that process of

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,250
transformation is really the technology

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,140
the tools Frank left is the easy part as

00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,990
we know it's really the cultural change

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,220
that's most difficult so as a part of

00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,640
your government of building a good

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,660
governance model begin to define what

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,670
your best practices are and and align

00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,340
that with your existing culture and then

00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,380
think through how you can use open

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,230
source technologies or open source

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,970
methods to begin to change your culture

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:36,960
and build training program many

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,270
enterprises and financial services

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,990
organizations really give this short

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:46,500
trip build a fairly detailed training

00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:48,270
program on the basics of open source why

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,670
it's important to your organization

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,770
don't overlook that because the more you

00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,390
share with your with your developer

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,640
community and other stakeholders why

00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:00,240
you're doing this it's easier it is for

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,080
them to buy into it make this available

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:07,110
as a part of HR onboarding for new

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,779
people make it available as a survey or

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,539
a fun test online for your existing

00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:16,169
developer community don't ignore this

00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:19,679
piece one of the first things it's

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:21,510
important to do is align on the risk so

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,769
every organization has a slightly

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:28,769
different risk tolerance and within a

00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:32,490
distributed organization as we as we as

00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:34,649
I showed earlier different groups within

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:38,130
the organization will have different

00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:40,769
views on risk and what that means to to

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,350
the company as a whole so one of the

00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:45,169
things we really highly recommend is one

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:48,029
of the first things you should do is

00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:50,610
align across the organization on what

00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:56,340
level of risk you are comfortable in

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:59,250
taking when it comes to open source also

00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,830
it's amazingly overlooked the notion of

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,510
defining what success not only to

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:08,340
success is to metrics here is two

00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,139
dimensions here one is success of our

00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,529
governance program what does success

00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:17,450
look like for us are we going to get to

00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:20,100
90% we our target is going to be

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,480
understanding 90% of the open source we

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,730
used in the organization or we're going

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,429
to try and get higher than that is

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,380
success to standardize you can get down

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,580
to granular levels with successes we're

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,070
going to discover all the open source

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,419
databases we're using and over time

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,380
we're going to try and get that down to

00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:39,269
just five for example define success of

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,980
the over all of your over all open

00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:45,630
source strategy that's really important

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:48,299
to do overly on because again a

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:51,179
governance program is something that you

00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,039
need to do so that you can get to

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,600
realizing the actual benefits of open

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,100
source so define what those benefits are

00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,710
to you each different organizations have

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,470
different types of definitions of

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,380
success engage your developers in this

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,299
whole process we recommend creating a

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,190
kind of a self-selected developing

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:10,529
council or community and have them

00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,860
elected representative to be a part of

00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:16,059
the governance

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,700
government process our internal and

00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:20,799
external communication policy so there

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,380
are good best practices around how you

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,799
communicate internally and externally

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:31,059
things through you know if you have to

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:33,070
issue a legal missive on open source and

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:36,070
risk and compliance and security and so

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:39,250
on make sure that it it's reviewed by a

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,980
number of different people too so that

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:45,130
it's tailored for the audience simple

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:47,470
things like that also many organizations

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,269
look at governance and compliance from

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,240
purely an internal perspective they look

00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:54,789
at the they look at the the software

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,559
that they're consuming from open source

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,789
sources but they're not necessarily

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,190
looking at the software that they're

00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:03,880
that they're ingesting from third-party

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,799
sources again frequently missed missed

00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,179
here and so we definitely recommend that

00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:09,149
that be a part of the process you have

00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:12,639
it's really important to understand what

00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:15,010
software what open source is in the

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,119
software that you are consuming from

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:22,419
your third-party vendors other ISPs or a

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,030
size like like web Pro and you should

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:26,859
have a form a way of tracking that

00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,320
whether it's using some of the resources

00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:32,260
out there like like open chain or as PDX

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,089
which allow you to create a standard

00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,639
bill of materials and you can say hey

00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:38,800
here's what we need to know about open

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,960
source before we'll buy it from you

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,280
please produce this bill of materials

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,399
for us and we know exactly what's in

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,409
your software and then engage HR and

00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,169
procurement in the process now this is

00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:52,540
again something that's that's mostly

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:56,260
overlooked they're there they're

00:34:52,540 --> 00:35:00,490
evidence essentially there are they're

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,140
added as an actor as what's were them

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,000
looking for they're added to this

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,890
process at the tail end there they're

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,690
essentially notified of the governance

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,790
model and program as opposed to being a

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,910
part of constructing it this is

00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,500
important for HR to be a part because we

00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,170
probably all heard of this notion of

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,320
frozen middle as open source becomes

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,960
more

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,700
or standard in your enterprise you have

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,380
the developers they that get it they

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,940
want to use it more and more and you

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,320
have executives that are beginning to

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,390
see what their peers are doing an open

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,040
source and in some instances issuing

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,110
edicts hey we're an open source first

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,550
company but it's that true it's that

00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,500
group in the middle that one they're

00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:40,960
paid for stability and predictability

00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,800
and reliability and for resisting change

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,270
alright so you've got this pressure

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,590
coming from the bottom from the top and

00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,960
the guy and the people in the middle are

00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,700
many not always obviously but in many

00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,200
instances kind of resisting that because

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:56,180
that's not their job so if you engage HR

00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,220
you can begin to think through how do we

00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,980
change how do we incentivize is that

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,740
that middle group the middle management

00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,870
layer to actually begin to incorporate

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:11,750
an embrace open source and helping the

00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:14,630
governance process so I'm going to

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:18,200
finish up here with with a recommended

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,000
set comes sequencing or how we recommend

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,280
you go about thinking how to implement

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,190
the governance program and open source

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,590
strategy overall so we've been talking a

00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,780
bit about about triage here that's

00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,950
typically the the first step we know

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,990
that many of you are going to that

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,750
process and it can take a bit of time

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,850
but you should also as you begin to

00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,700
think about your governance model think

00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,410
about okay we have to do typically

00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,840
there's a sense of urgency to

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,990
understanding how much open source were

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:51,650
using today are there security are there

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,370
are their license or IP issues let's get

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,040
that fixed

00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,540
let's move it into them a steady-state

00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,550
let's move it in and let's make sure

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:02,510
that we we're kind of defining that

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,760
change from addressing this from from an

00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:09,080
immediate perspective to moving it into

00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,150
a steady-state governance model there we

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,760
remain recommend along with this triage

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,650
process that you begin to drive internal

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,450
alignment at the different levels of the

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,110
organization at the developer at the

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,970
mid-management

00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,910
at the executive level with the

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,710
different functions HR procurement legal

00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,350
it's important to as early as possible

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,750
to get internal alignment on what

00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:31,060
miss tolerance is what your overall

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,130
strategy is how you define how you're

00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,290
defining success in the organization

00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:40,750
that should be an exercise that started

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:42,760
off at the very beginning stage then as

00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,350
you begin to get a hold of where you are

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,880
and what open source you're using you're

00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,380
beginning to drive internal alignment

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,870
okay and now it's time to really begin

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,910
to think about your enterprise wide open

00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,470
source strategy what is that strategy

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,330
what's the business rationale and

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,990
justification one of the success metrics

00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:00,430
for the different aspects of strategy

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,930
and then think through how you're going

00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,820
to actually implement that across the

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,040
organization as you begin to think

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,890
through that key part of it is community

00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,750
engagement and when I say community

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,110
engagement in this context it's very

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,370
broad it's how do we how do we engage

00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,470
with communities how how do we

00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:21,250
contribute back to communities which

00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:24,100
foundations should we be a part of what

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,890
resources are we going to allocate to

00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:29,500
our community engagement model how is

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:32,350
that going to be governed if we're going

00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:37,530
to open source something what resources

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:37,530
are necessary to to apply to that

00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,380
because today if you look in if you look

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,350
across the top 10 banks in the world

00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,470
today they have about 5,000 projects on

00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,720
github and that's growing exponentially

00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,110
but of those 5,000 projects maybe a

00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,960
hundred or actually vibrant and viable

00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:04,240
so it's really important to to have a

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,240
clear well-thought-out plan that if

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,620
you're going to open source something

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,860
make sure that you're allocating the

00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,720
right level of resources and making the

00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,430
right level of commitment to make that

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,190
project successful which will help you

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,710
stand out in the in the very crowded

00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,710
field in the last process mmm the last

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:28,420
thing we recommend is to start the the

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:31,150
kind of organizational cultural process

00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,070
wealth in the early here bringing open

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,440
source into your organization accruing

00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,390
the benefits of

00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,150
open-source is really a lot about

00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:41,010
changing culture and so the earlier you

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:44,240
begin to do that the better and of

00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:47,700
course that is an ongoing process

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:52,760
so I've mmm I've thrown a lot out there

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:54,569
today this this is you know our

00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,569
recommendation is going through a

00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:59,940
governance it going to building a

00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:04,470
governance model is a little bit like

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,660
building the first piece of software so

00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:10,589
it's really hard to write that first

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:14,730
piece of software and but you can't get

00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:16,349
to that you can't get to that economy of

00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:21,569
scale unless you go through that that

00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:23,099
those first few hard steps and because

00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:24,960
if you think about it releasing that

00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,869
second that second piece of software

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,270
it's so much easier once you've gone

00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:31,589
through that in the third and fourth and

00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,869
the fifth and the tenth and the hundred

00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:35,520
is so much easier once you've gone

00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:40,760
through the hard work of getting that

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:44,190
the software built the first time so

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:48,630
this is a little bit of our experiences

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:57,560
and our lessons learned in the other

00:40:48,630 --> 00:41:00,690
comments like I'm sorry I missed that

00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,790
III was saying thank you Andrew I think

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:06,240
is a very enlightening presentation but

00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:10,410
yes any questions from the from the

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:14,630
audience yes hi hi Andrew it's Sally

00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:17,730
here I have a question so where we are

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:20,160
purchasing something from a third party

00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,980
and with regards to the Bill of

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,240
Materials that we are requesting from

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:30,210
them how realistic is it for us to

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:33,690
expect them to provide us with a list of

00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:36,930
the open-source licenses associated to

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,599
their embedded components confirming

00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:42,089
that they comply with the license terms

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,980
and conditions confirming that they will

00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:45,420
address identified security

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,970
vulnerabilities in their software

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,700
products and also request

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,980
that they indemnify our company in the

00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,119
event any breach of license terms and

00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:59,099
conditions occurs how realistic that

00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:02,369
with emulation to development executed

00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:05,790
by them is that realistic for us to

00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:09,480
expect that they agree to to those terms

00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:11,910
and conditions or requirements we're

00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,430
expecting that that's the case for new

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,440
software that we're purchasing these are

00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,109
the sort of guideline rules that we're

00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,170
going to implement in our procurement

00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,730
process so I just need to just wanted to

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,010
understand your view one on our

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:30,630
expectations

00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:31,859
sure well and you ask a few questions in

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:36,780
there let me break it down a little bit

00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:40,170
so first off there is there is a direct

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,570
relationship between the size and nature

00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:45,090
of the organization you're buying the

00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:48,030
software from if you ask for this from

00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,540
an IBM and NSA P and the organizations

00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:54,359
like that yeah they'll be able to do it

00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:56,940
and it it wouldn't be too much of an

00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:59,089
issue but as you go down there is a

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,099
direct relationship as you could in

00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:03,930
using accounting to mid-level software

00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:10,349
event and software providers down to

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:11,760
startups they they will have many of

00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:14,010
them don't understand what software

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,700
they're using themselves to make in

00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:22,050
their own right and it's alright so

00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,760
today it's very typical that they

00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,630
understand what their software does but

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,460
they don't necessarily understand

00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,190
everything that makes up that secret

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:33,119
sauce so what we think some

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,530
organizations do is and many of them

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,200
have not scanned the software so they

00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,880
can't produce that the materials for you

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,190
some organizations we've seen actually

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,910
offer that some enterprises like

00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:47,010
yourself off of that as to they'll say

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,540
we have a recommended vendor who does

00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:51,470
the scanning please work with them

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,670
they'll do it with you and it will be

00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,109
and sometimes if the software is

00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,240
important some enterprises pay for that

00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:58,760
sometimes they push that back on on the

00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,280
software vendor that's that's kind of

00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,640
next but that's a part of what we

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,510
recommend is whomever your preferred

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:12,080
vendor is having an agreement with them

00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,820
that they will audit third-party

00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,070
suppliers at your request which

00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,880
typically isn't a hardship for them to

00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:22,280
do so so that's one way around it and

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:29,510
then the indemnification issue is a bit

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:31,190
harder we'll we'll provide the high

00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,450
levels of indemnification because

00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,570
they're not not particularly worried

00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,880
about ever having to to adhere to it you

00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,830
know there's kind of an issue it's if an

00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,940
issue whether it's an IP or license or

00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:46,220
compliance issue comes up that

00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,460
particularly you know that particularly

00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:53,960
egregious like it's it's actually a real

00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:56,210
issue then it there you're not going to

00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,950
be the only one that has it with them

00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:00,580
whomever else they provided that

00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,570
software to will also have the issue and

00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,690
at the end of the day no one's going to

00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,980
collect anything I'm a start-up I mean

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:11,390
you really at the end day you really

00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:14,150
don't have a lot of recourse and so

00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:20,480
again we recommend that that enterprises

00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:21,830
have a have an approach for particular

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,270
those those startups that they're

00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:27,590
working with that anticipates the fact

00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,080
that one they don't know the software

00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:31,340
and they don't know themselves but they

00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,260
don't know what's in their software in

00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:36,260
the day and they don't know how to go

00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,760
about identifying that so you can make

00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,230
it easy on them with just a little bit

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,120
of work and say please work with our

00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,160
recommended vendor they'll help you

00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:47,600
produce the Bill of Materials we can

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,940
address it after that okay thank you I

00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:55,040
mean obviously that's that's helpful

00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:57,440
just to understand that we may come

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,500
across some a challenge with you know

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,020
according to the size of the company and

00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,450
the vendor they're engaging with and

00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,150
that started may need a little bit more

00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:11,900
work or some back-and-forth negotiation

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:12,800
so that's really helpful thank you sure

00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,910
and we see

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,920
and last piece on that if they're a

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,600
venture back startup with a really cool

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,250
hot technology that you're looking after

00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:24,380
whatever reason many VCS require before

00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:29,140
they'll write a check they they require

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,140
to understand what's in in the code so

00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:34,670
and that's actually you know fairly

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,390
common today so they may actually have

00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:50,600
it depends on how recent that that scan

00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:52,580
is thank you Andrew you mentioned

00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,790
training and I know that's something

00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:59,390
that a lot of our members are sort of

00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:02,870
focused on right now can you can you

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:06,490
give a brief overview on on sort of you

00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:08,180
know who who you deliver or you know who

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,490
enterprises should be focused on

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:15,830
delivering open source related training

00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:17,960
does that training vary across roles you

00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:23,660
know how do you get started on producing

00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:27,620
a useful training program so it it will

00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,630
vary across roles but there is always or

00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,280
should be a kind of lowest common

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:36,830
denominator and open source 101 and 201

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,570
that everyone who will be touching open

00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:41,930
source in some way shape or form should

00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:44,420
go through and demonstrate retention

00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:47,090
knowledge retention essentially and

00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:49,790
that'll be you know the basics the

00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:51,620
fundamentals associate layman's

00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:54,860
understanding of what open source is

00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,440
what copyleft is where it is today why

00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,420
it's important from an industry

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,920
perspective why it's important to that

00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:05,780
particular whatever organization it is

00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,160
so we definitely recommend and that's

00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,320
easiest way to get started and building

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,670
a training program is creating those you

00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,530
know one or two levels the lowest common

00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:17,360
denominator knowledge we definitely

00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,650
recommend that it that the web-based I

00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,530
mean that almost goes without without

00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:25,859
saying today web-based that it has

00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:27,809
I don't like the word test but it really

00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:30,630
you want to understand that you do want

00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:33,839
to know that everyone's gone through it

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:35,490
and has the basic understanding of it

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,670
there are certainly ways to with game of

00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:44,660
high the training that make it fun make

00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:46,950
it make it not not burdensome and then

00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,950
the training should be modular so you

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,690
have a module for legal module for each

00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,480
our module through procurement modules

00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:55,859
for developers for security so on a lot

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,990
of them will have the light of these

00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:59,760
different modules will have also very

00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,589
similar they kind of a similar baseline

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:10,069
but then there'll be specifics to that

00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:10,069
particular rule one function thanks I

00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:17,400
guess on that same topic how deep do you

00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:20,940
want to go in in your training program

00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,799
on the sort of specifics of your own

00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:27,109
implementation of an open source program

00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:31,349
or you know do you leave that stuff for

00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:34,130
documentation that's that's actually a

00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:38,280
good good question an important nuance

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:42,180
we think for certain communities within

00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:44,790
the organization such as developers it's

00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,500
important to go fairly deep then the

00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,609
reason why you do that is not only

00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,760
because you want to make sure that

00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:53,910
they're understanding how to come up the

00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:57,839
process for complying with your open

00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:01,680
source program but also again it's it's

00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:04,200
a bit it helps to get them embedded

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,859
pilson's to get them bought in to the

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,359
process which is really important we as

00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,890
a community really need to focus on

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,799
making sure that we're enabling

00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:15,869
developers and that we're reducing the

00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:18,390
overhead or burden to them as much as

00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:21,030
possible and so being open transparent

00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:23,280
and engaging them in the process is one

00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:31,099
of our strongest recommendations and

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:31,099
that includes training great thank you

00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:40,390
alright well if anyone wants to reach

00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:44,470
out with any specific questions you'll

00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:46,090
please feel free to do so and if anyone

00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,890
has some comments they want to share I

00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:51,610
know we have a mixture on the call of

00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,160
end-users and vendors love to get your

00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:56,290
feedback and input you know is there

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,840
something critical is something that you

00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,610
feels really important that that I might

00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,560
have overlooked today you know please

00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:05,580
feel free to share it and we'll also

00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,750
make the obviously the slides available

00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,840
all right excellent thank you so much

00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,860
Andrew I really appreciate you were

00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,160
preparing this and presenting it to the

00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,160
group

00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:24,099
