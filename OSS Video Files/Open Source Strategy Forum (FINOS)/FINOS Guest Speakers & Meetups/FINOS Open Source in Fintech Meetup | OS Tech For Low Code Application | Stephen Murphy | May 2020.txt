00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,880
enough about finis I'd actually like to

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,840
pass you over to Steven agenesis welcome

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,920
Steven thanks for having me in

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,030
organizing the webinar as well

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,440
thanks for one of who's participating

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,360
right now and if you're watching the

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
recording after the presentation so

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,190
thank you today it was great that James

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,239
and the team are they not asked us to

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,920
speak and talk about how we Genesis we

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,349
have a I was willing a low code

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,140
application platform leveraged open

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:33,660
source technology of historically today

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,340
and how we see that moving forward and

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,540
we thought the best way of doing that is

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,269
ultimately talking a little bit about

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,200
Genesis and some of the history and

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,849
talking about our low code application

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,310
platform which has been built

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,720
specifically for our industry some of

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,299
the challenges of using open source

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,799
which I'm sure some of you have seen and

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,390
gone through or about to go through if

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,510
you're leveraging open source technology

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,060
some lessons learned which we had in our

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,400
experience over the last seven years as

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,230
well as real life examples of open

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,599
source technology within the Genesis

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,190
platform it's worthwhile notes here

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,459
we've also got some of the Genesis team

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,980
on alcohol we have Jose poison it's been

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,040
is a head of technical architecture for

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,810
the platform and server engineering he's

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,950
been there from the day one so he's

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,420
lived and breathed all of these

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,700
challenges and experiences that I'm

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,010
going to talk to and we also have Felipe

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,650
Oliveira our global head of sales and

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:32,280
marketing and faces off as we thought or

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:36,000
more with finis yeah let me quickly go

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,590
to the first line really some vision is

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,720
little timeline on the bottom here I'll

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,519
talk about what the timeline is we we've

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,980
been around actually for over seven

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,680
years now and I'm going to refer to this

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,870
timeline in the presentation cause the

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,260
first three years and what I called that

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,349
Genesis zero point zero phase we were in

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,690
purely we had no clients but we were

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:01,230
purely building from the ground up our

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,450
alo code application platform when I see

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,970
some interesting history to this later

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,680
in the presentation and really what what

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,079
we saw was there was a perfect storm in

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,200
our industry and and technology in

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,000
general we totally a few things that

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,769
happened one there was his concept of

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,140
micro services obviously that words

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,590
widely use nowadays there wasn't really

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,860
used so many years ago now and we've we

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,120
looked

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,210
I said if we could build a platform

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,860
based on microservices which then that

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,319
platform was a low code application

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,699
platform that would change our industry

00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:38,460
it would allow us to either build but a

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,319
solution for our clients or players

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,599
could buy solutions from us but it not a

00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,939
buy or build it could be by end or build

00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:46,830
because we could use this El Cap with

00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,229
its low code application platform to

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,639
solve that conundrum some other things

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,699
which were perfect storm for us and the

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,860
key topic today is open source all of a

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,389
sudden we didn't to build that that low

00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,800
put application platform there's a lot

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,990
of open source technologies we can

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,330
leverage versus having to go to

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,099
commercial technologies to take

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,610
components of software we need it too

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:09,870
that was a big thing for us in 2013

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,029
albeit that our industry and other

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,520
industries were not somewhat opens who

00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:16,979
open source technology at time cloud

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,479
services obviously infrastructure was

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,279
very easy for us to load up

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,349
infrastructure and ultimately we were

00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,870
self-funded so that from a cost

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:27,599
perspective that minimized that cost and

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,150
that time to market not only the

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,560
industry was ripe for change so we had

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,120
this perfect storm and we had this

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,370
vision that we wanted to be this Liat

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,789
this low code application platform again

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,909
built for our industry we've learned a

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:44,159
lot during that process so what you

00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,839
think about the platform and this local

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:48,000
application platform for our industry

00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,529
ground up is a micro services both

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,750
infrastructure a highly scalable

00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,669
resilient performin it's got things

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,069
specific to our industry business

00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:59,580
components we're not it's mirror iyx

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:03,479
clips so big the industry adapts if i

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,219
fix an FP ml persian api's etc it's lots

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,500
of talling we put around that which

00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:09,900
allows you to heaven both no code no

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,150
code parts to the platform as well as

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,490
low code what's really important to

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,900
understand here is where every part of

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,229
the platform we use open source

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,520
technology in some way shape or form and

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:23,550
as I mentioned previously in the

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,379
previous slide is that the open source

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,930
technology and leverage in that was

00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,879
imperative whether or not it was

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,610
messaging and low latency a messaging

00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,600
infrastructure all the way through to

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,760
kind of web UI components

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,590
so it's used across the whole path you

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,900
can imagine so that this this is all

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,400
great open source obviously 70 years ago

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,710
it wasn't being widely adopted - there's

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,000
a number of challenges in some areas

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,650
we've announced that you'll see that

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,200
open source technologies that's emerged

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,600
clear winners and in some areas there

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,510
still a variety of open source

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,400
technologies which have pros and cons so

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,100
in some ways open source is low in

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,170
college because we're leveraging an open

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,090
source software you need less code so

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,280
it's by the way it's kind of hard at

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,960
heart of a lot of things we've done but

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
its challenges right so this with with

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,130
as with so many open source technologies

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,010
available as risks of choosing one of

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,180
those technologies and for instance

00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,490
certainly these are just three of the

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,440
challenges this and more so badly so

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,720
three that we we only wanted to

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,300
highlight in the presentation you choose

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,320
the wrong technology for the use case

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,110
we're going to discuss that in this

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,970
material it could be better technology

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,200
so you choose one technology and guess

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,310
what something happens or something

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,900
comes along afterwards and also if you

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,240
need to change that technology how much

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,250
time and how much cost will be there no

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,670
good example this in the presentation is

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,950
you have there's no SQL databases but

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:54,070
they've got their very specific API is

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,590
for their technology which are not it's

00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:00,180
not easy to jump between one type of an

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,830
SQL database to another our SQL database

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,350
so we had to weigh up those challenges

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,850
so we knew at the time we wanted to

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,070
leverage as much of open source as we

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,470
could but we needed to make kind of

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:15,390
decisions based on based on that our

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,390
priorities now and our use cases again

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,689
specific use case is a any entrepreneurs

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,229
on the call will appreciate sums of the

00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:28,629
highs and the lows so back in 2013 we

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:31,180
started this journey and some of you may

00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:35,019
upload a foundation BB a great piece of

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,029
database technology we spend nearly 1

00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,979
million over two years leveraging this

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,180
technology to be at a heart about an

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,050
in-memory name value pair database

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,399
everything was going great and we

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,800
thought we would have two years of R&D

00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,259
before we went to the market and then

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,040
something happened

00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:56,170
I'm wait Apple Apple decided this was

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,889
such great technology that they would

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,380
acquire this technology and therefore it

00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:05,829
was no longer available in the open

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,839
public domain to leverage and although

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,910
we had ten minutes of being very happy

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,029
root out that we made a great technology

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,759
decision to use foundation DB because

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,230
Apple acquired that technology to be

00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,870
their core part of their iCloud

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,480
infrastructure storage we also had that

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,089
heartbreaking moment that we don't so we

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,010
made a decision where we would put at

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,959
risk now I've actually even taken our

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,519
platform to market because we didn't

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:36,220
ultimately have chosen to use foundation

00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:39,100
DB ironically after three years Apple

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,110
actually open sourced basically read so

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,949
it's kind of funny how those swings and

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,079
roundabouts

00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:46,149
but during which time we actually

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,800
launched the outlet low code application

00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,440
platform and we're already building

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,329
solutions and products from that we

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,889
actually realized there was a number of

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,339
lessons learned I'll talk about what

00:09:53,889 --> 00:10:00,370
happened post-2015 but it was quite an

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:03,130
interest in timeline for us because we

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,050
really kind of put all of our chordates

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,120
first how do you kind of built around a

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,350
foundation that would be so for those

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,209
people looking at their open source

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:16,240
journey our our and our open source

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:18,040
journey we had the use of proprietary

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,689
technologies post high risk even though

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,680
they were they don't want to public

00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:26,769
domain and we're we learned early on I

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,870
Jamie I say that fortunately in 2020 it

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,030
was unfortunately at the time it was

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,700
very unfortunate

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,880
but from a long-term outlook perspective

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,770
it really was good for us it's somewhat

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,650
delayed our launch for our platform but

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,080
it was a good thing cause the approach

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,240
we then took and really what that what

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,550
we decided that point was at within our

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,670
platform we had to provide some

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,830
abstraction around core parceled of the

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,200
system and the the data face the

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,990
specifically not time to enter but

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,910
standard data which we have we would

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,680
then actually add abstraction around

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,510
them and we've done that not just that a

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,490
database level we've also done that for

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,650
instance in messaging which I'm also

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,330
gonna talk about later in the

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,180
presentation

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,560
so I've happened today we're much more

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,690
in control of our own destiny

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,790
and what we've been able to do is we've

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,120
abstracted lessons learned rich

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:23,220
abstracted out the database into an

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,260
abstraction layer and what we here now

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,390
have ways we support three different

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,340
open-source technologies we support

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,530
aerospike Joseph I have a Enterprise

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,540
commercial arrangement and there's a

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,090
very good very specific use cases would

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,650
use them for foundation DB and I guess

00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,210
what when they become open-source again

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,760
we're already very used to using a

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,780
foundation VP I'm also Postgres and

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,610
again Postgres is you guys have are we

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,620
very familiar with the certain use cases

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,950
where post-first works extremely well as

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,260
well our product developers and people

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,670
use developing on the platform when it

00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,980
whether it's our own product velopment

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,500
team or whatnot it's our clients that's

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,390
extracted away from them and again so if

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,550
there's a new open source technology

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,260
database technology in the future we can

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,120
also include that but it won't be

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:14,310
impacting the rest of the platform or

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,990
the solution which would product there's

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,240
really I wanted to tell going to Moore

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,280
went James the team asked us to talk

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
about kind of where we've leveraged open

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,240
source or why open source is so

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,210
important to us at Genesis it's really

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,640
three good examples of where use we use

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,830
open source in the platform I'm going to

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,130
talk about them more from it this is

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,320
really more to server-side technology

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,150
then processing we all took me use

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,430
reactive some of you on the call may

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,800
using that already or heard of that it's

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,120
a great technology for Oh

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,630
to manage an asynchronous have been

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,390
event-based sequences of events and

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,790
observables the second piece is event

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,670
and our notification message bus we were

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,680
initially using 0nq and that was a great

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,459
technology France easy to use widely

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,440
used but then worldly as we as we as we

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,110
started to do war on war and had clients

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,680
moved to the cloud there was challenges

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,990
around around using 0 0 mq in a multi in

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,040
a multi infrastructure cloud environment

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:19,019
with multiple servers across different

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,540
structure instances and that actually

00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,220
led us to actually move to Iran so now

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,170
within the platform we still have it

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,410
that use is have attracted to it could

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,990
be using on cube we predominance our

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,880
internal message bus and it's also worth

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,279
noting that we also support solace some

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,209
of our clients have invested a lot of

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,850
time money and energy and resources into

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:44,820
solace implementations so again that's

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,130
abstracted we use Iran but platforms

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,390
easily configured to leverage you saw

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,550
this infrastructure that one of our

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,709
clients may have invested in as well and

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,839
we're gonna can't come back to the

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,060
database layer again in a second where

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,800
we speak about the earlier scenario

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,880
where we support three open source

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,880
database technologies

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,840
processing there's lots of lots of great

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,760
things to do with reactive that it's and

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,560
Hosea like I mentioned is on that call

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,540
so if any technical questions or details

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,450
you'll go to answer at the end of the

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,350
presentation I want to interject

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,360
provides a great level of extract

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,460
abstraction around some of the real kind

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,140
of low level threading synchronization

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,500
right so if the concurrent data

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,590
structures and i/o so that was a what a

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,200
great degree positive for us when we

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,540
decided to use our X it's simple for its

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,550
simplifies asynchronous events it allows

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,710
us to treat them as streams of the veins

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,300
which simplifies for our product

00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,340
solution developers using the local

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,770
application platform or our clients that

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,500
well opposed as well it's something

00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,630
which is widely used so for instance it

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,510
is that by Microsoft and Netflix in

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,010
their technology ultimately it's it's

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,510
used for our different parts of this

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,400
software solutions and our solutions

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,510
both a database level API could be a

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,020
front-end UI through to a variety of

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:08,020
libraries available

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:09,880
panting well notification so as

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,700
mentioned we initially start with zero

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,590
aren't you great messaging bus for us

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,090
initially as we started that seven-year

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:20,620
journey widely used it's easy to get for

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,890
our core engineering team much close

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,770
they delete we had more resources that

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,480
using in the past but has we evolved

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,400
that our industry evolved on all mobile

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,540
open to cloud enterprise on installs

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,000
recognized they were better technologies

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,890
there so our core engineering team not

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,830
our product and solutions team then

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,230
started to provide air on as a

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,550
alternative and ultimately some of you

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,340
are going to be already be aware of air

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:51,310
on its very low latency high performance

00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,320
technology it's also aligned with our

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,170
industry as well fixed messaging so we

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,060
have fixed

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,190
components as well again all based on

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,830
air on to get the low latency high speed

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,510
and performance scalability in terms of

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,320
messaging so again kind of similar to

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:10,360
the database history well we went from

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,850
foundation DB to being stuck on what to

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,530
use very similar in a similar way we

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,329
still do supporter and cubot hold

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,899
everything

00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:21,779
now is on errand and as I also mentioned

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,970
in the highlight points is we also

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:27,269
support Sonics so we found a number of

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,399
our clients I've met invested a lot to

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:31,829
their solid infrastructure and made that

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,519
a prerequisite and pre requirement to

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:37,799
integrate into solid infrastructure we

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,899
do that so it can run seamlessly on

00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,910
solace and again our product solution

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,129
developers or our clients developers

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,839
it's completely seamless to them because

00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,839
that's been an abstract way

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,550
but the database there has mentioned not

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,520
for it we also support non x this is for

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,990
non time series data

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,330
now industry we do have a lot of time

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,250
series it sequential data sets that we

00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,170
deal with as well we use a different

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,660
database open source technologies for

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:11,100
that I see is mentioned the foundation

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:14,190
in good in terms of transaction

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,910
processing as a guarantee transactions

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:19,440
if you do some research and there's also

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,450
links that I've provided in this

00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,140
presentation it's off backgrounds for

00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:27,690
why there was so my apologue item you

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,040
also use aerospike lots of great things

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:35,580
there aerospike is very good at single

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,380
transaction type a request and what we

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,230
get some data service getting beta

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,510
extremely quickly will recognize that

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,120
they're used by a number of firms like

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,150
MasterCard credit card processing time

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,080
companies they're widely used good name

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,330
in the industry obviously is post cards

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,460
very traditional when we go we've gone

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,770
through procurement processes with some

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,590
of our clients and they are not latency

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,790
sensitive they are post groceries

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,190
extremely well recognized within

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,290
industry so there's a lots of benefits

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,390
or of bonanza support those three and

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,600
depending on the business use case

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,490
through some simple configuration and

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,200
using the platform you can choose what

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,240
they to base mode you want to work in

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,480
our product solution developers very

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,670
clients developers you know they they

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,830
won't let substracted away they just

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,380
seen the benefits of that depending what

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,170
mode they're running in yellow the thing

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,560
about process and is that ultimately if

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,210
you're your path or such point Postgres

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,730
enabled like the way we've developed our

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,600
platform you leverage other technologies

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,220
which altima use the same protocol so

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,530
good examples of that would be a

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,150
cockroach DB for instance so that

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,340
there's lots of benefits that we found

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,640
we see from what we know to support

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,710
Postgres at that level as well we've

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,190
flown for a lot of that some of it was

00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,560
on purpose

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,620
so we can have a question some answers I

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,690
wanted to end with why

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,760
Genesis and finish on my degree recently

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,130
joined finis I've been talking to the

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,289
Finnish community for a long time now

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,510
hopefully what you guys have seen from

00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,860
this is that ultimately leveraging open

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,309
source was that was at the very

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,010
beginning of day one of Genesis history

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:22,710
it was allowed us in that perfect storm

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,169
with a few other factors to really start

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,610
the company start our journey but

00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,250
building a local code application

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,740
platform so open source has been key

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:34,710
it's a it's a core part of everything we

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,250
do so we we've wait we're very thankful

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,919
for that

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,090
that's happened in industry we want to

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,649
contribute to open source there's are

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,840
lots of things especially Jose in the

00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:45,480
engineering team are involved in around

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,850
open source technologies so we want to

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,730
contribute in general to open source but

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,260
specifically those which are very

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,240
relevant to our industry and a lot of

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,750
the initiatives that fin us are leading

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,429
and being involved committee members not

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,380
only there's specific fitness

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:03,539
initiatives we believe on we believe

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,240
strongly about that we want to

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,890
contribute to as well FTC three

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,679
financial objects are two great examples

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,070
where standardization and data models

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,200
and interoperability of messaging or not

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,299
be on the desktop or webknights by a

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,390
REST API is on server based technology

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,700
cloud even yesterday James mentioned

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,250
there was a new initiative around data

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,710
masking it's something that we're very

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,630
passionate about we host most of our

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,970
solutions for our clients so therefore

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:36,270
there's always that conversation

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,299
discussion around how we mask key

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,450
sensitive beta client data or the

00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:44,909
modeling positions and how we go for a

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,169
UAT cycle in our clients so there's

00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:48,750
there's really a really important

00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,730
resource for us to join finis those are

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:54,059
the three main ones we look forward to

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,409
doing more and more in us and finally

00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,940
obviously that everyone on the call and

00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:59,779
if you're watching it's awesome

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:04,110
pandemic crisis thanks for participating

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:06,149
hope stay safe from well things asked me

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,020
to stay - 20 minutes that was 21 minutes

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,020
or 20 minutes

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,750
absolutely so I do have a couple of

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,240
questions for you but um I'm pleased to

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,370
say that um Chris has been working in

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,530
the background to pull a couple of

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:26,070
people out of the Hat who are going to

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,450
win finals t-shirts and I'm happy to say

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,760
well I don't know if I'm happy to say

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,059
that they're both from over here in in

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,059
the UK but we have Sarah Durrani

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:39,780
from streets consulting and also Mike

00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:42,030
Richardson from majority limited so

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,460
Alexandra from the finest team will be

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,309
in contact with you to get your details

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,360
and we'll get a finished tisha over to

00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:54,030
base thank you very much so I'm going to

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,650
kick off the the Q&A basalt mean so if

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,630
anybody else has got a question that you

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,690
would like to our Steven feel free to

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,299
drop your question in the chat but in

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:07,440
the meantime I'm Steven I was wondering

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:09,870
can you arm and you answer this how has

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,350
open source accelerated your development

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:16,970
our genesis and has it also saved you

00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:20,760
any cash any costs

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,399
so if you imagine we use a bench market

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,350
outside of the finance industry is of

00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:27,570
the these low code application platform

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,130
providers that you reduce his time and

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:34,019
cost by 80% it's a hospital

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,970
so when answering two sections first

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,539
thing we see our local code application

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,299
platform

00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,309
I've been caused by an 80 plus percent I

00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,840
would say the same is to be honest in

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,519
many ways of different parts of

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,850
different different open source

00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,500
technologies we used that it's

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,110
accelerated if we wanted to build that

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,539
platform from scratch when I'm taking

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,549
this three four years I think it's seven

00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,990
eight years there was and I suppose

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:01,860
something like be enough time man made

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,779
me would just be timing which cost badly

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,440
if you wanted a low latency in-memory

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:09,330
database option one I would buy it from

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,889
a and I won't have to talk to here

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,950
technology can't benders in the world

00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:16,019
under I cost options who build it

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,750
yourself or that would be a huge amount

00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,490
at long time to build a yourself

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,250
maintain that yourself and the cost of

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,840
the resources to build that so see ya it

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,850
was a if you imagine the both might is

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,490
the how the messages go across the wire

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:33,330
from a server to but the rest'll to a

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:35,250
web UI will go through to their wanting

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,279
to talk about the database technology as

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,909
an example is having a highly scalable

00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:45,659
resilient low latency beta victimology

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:49,429
is no no small thing so therefore you

00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:52,919
have to be able to have to be able to

00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:55,169
better support that and we were able to

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,669
leverage that without the need of a

00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:57,899
tablet that has helped or going to a

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,559
commercial vendor and therefore

00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:03,330
commercial relationship so yeah Enki and

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,760
it's able to huge amount of money and

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,299
time

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,940
that's amazing and for people who are on

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:14,480
the call who haven't come across locate

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:18,119
can you explain what lo code is and how

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,149
it enables financial services businesses

00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,649
my question be something which we spend

00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:24,119
pretty much every day now right now to

00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:26,219
be communicating within the industry

00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:27,479
what we're doing so yeah so really I

00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:29,609
think you kind of when you talk about

00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,949
local code application platforms you can

00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:34,559
really think of it it's two sections the

00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:35,669
third section is low code and the second

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,579
section really think of it as an

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:41,789
application platform we really think of

00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:44,489
it in terms of within it is better to

00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:49,349
buy a configuration but the XML it could

00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:53,009
be very our UI tool in also Java Python

00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:55,289
these languages we support having a

00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,539
number of libraries for them which allow

00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,569
them to build solutions products

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:03,479
extremely quickly let's go an example to

00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:05,339
face validation of transactions it's

00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:07,079
something that you need across many

00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:10,049
different industries it's also something

00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:13,379
very important to ensure market how to

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:16,289
market so when we say to face validation

00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:18,359
the concept of warnings and errors the

00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:21,539
warning is like I want to put a new

00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,759
order in I might have breached my risk

00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:26,279
limits and that could be a warning to

00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,909
say I recognize that but I could still

00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:31,199
do that or a hard error which means you

00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:35,879
recognize you've tried to do it but you

00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:37,409
cannot do it so code so you can actually

00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:39,149
when I talk we talk about locally

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,149
accelerating the development process and

00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:44,729
when that can I be done through our

00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:47,129
hauling our configuration or still

00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:49,139
getting into some of the Java and Python

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:52,259
if you want to do so you don't want to

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:53,279
use the duration on Oh coach warden the

00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,469
Alber aspects is the application

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,239
platform application platform ism is

00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:59,579
actually the platform which runs there

00:25:57,239 --> 00:26:01,439
the actual infrastructure that runs the

00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,669
the solution so you've got all the

00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:05,509
development and if you mention the rest

00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:08,549
of it being also part of the delivery

00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:10,949
rate that the DevOps so it's the actual

00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:13,529
binding of those underneath the covers

00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:14,999
is a micro services infrastructure so

00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,729
ultimately that you can also be running

00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:20,639
those solutions knowing it knowing it's

00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:22,529
a run on again highly resilient scalable

00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:24,659
technology and when we built this low

00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:27,929
code application platform got Kirk

00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,999
you've been a tease exists as well so a

00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:31,410
lot of that client initially wanted it

00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:34,340
as on-prem instance

00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:37,620
so we've evolved as well to support

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,080
cloud by default and horizontal

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,660
scalability list their sympathy all of

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,309
those things as well

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,820
that's what low code and the application

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,200
platform

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,200
okay as it's known

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,060
thank you thank you for answering that

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,620
and I are just - I'd like to remind

00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,600
everybody he's on the line that we do

00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,100
have a few minutes left with um Steven

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,390
for anybody he would like to ask a

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,100
question to him and and the genesis team

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:09,180
but in the meantime as you as you type

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,220
in in the chat I'd like to say you are a

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,190
famous member so we met we mentioned at

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,560
the beginning of the of the meetup that

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,350
you are a famous member but I'd like to

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,210
know how do you plan to either leverage

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,990
finished projects or how are you

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,309
actually leveraging Thinnes projects now

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,530
great question we I suppose one

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,600
something which is top of mind for me

00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,159
personally I think there's two areas

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,100
where we're really trying to leverage

00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,350
finish early the presentation we spoke

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,179
about these business components and what

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,380
we see is that there's a great

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:45,340
opportunity for the industry to

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:47,080
standardize data schemes and ultimately

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,440
this is this initiative or financial

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,419
objects so as you as you start to

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,159
integrate or whether or not you're a

00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,740
hedge fund asset management firm a

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,179
clearinghouse we have a new product

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,390
we've built in panchal lying around

00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:03,190
syndicated loans another now so you see

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,100
we've seen certain parts of the industry

00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:09,190
of them a lot around standardization you

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,350
look at the fixed messaging protocol FPL

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,640
for instance as well as certain areas of

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,309
the industry which has not had gone

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,799
through that standardization and working

00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:21,669
together to as an open-source community

00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:24,210
so the areas that we're really in each

00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:26,230
where is where we really are keen to

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,610
involved in is both of the financial

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,650
objects and anything see-through they're

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:33,760
both both quite tightly linked as you

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:36,400
know just finding standards of message

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,260
structures within FDC trade for desktop

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,120
interoperability there's a lot of reuse

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,179
for that can be applied to these

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,130
financial objects initiative so yeah

00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,840
with its there's an area initially for

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,659
us that said we've got a huge amount

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,510
within the cloud already so there's

00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:54,669
other parts of the of the finishes that

00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,360
we want involved it yesterday you

00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:00,490
mentioned data masking that is a

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,380
classical as we do that today for a lot

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,659
of our clients as mentioned post

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,880
majority of our product some solutions

00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,710
for our clients so yeah I think with the

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,020
ones I listed on that final slide FTC's

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,700
to a financial objects we're going to be

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,929
involved in from on the day one and

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,809
there's other stuff we're definitely

00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:19,360
interested in to help lead both in terms

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,440
of cloud on beta mask

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,660
and for people on the line who are

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,890
interested in what's even sovereignty at

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,870
the moment we're receiving a

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,540
contribution in turf in us called

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:33,429
synthetic beta hub and I'm working with

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,320
the team at the moment to show you a

00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:37,120
webinar for the future so they can

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,500
actually take us through you know what

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,590
that technology is and what it actually

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,190
brings into the foundation and then

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,590
finally the very final question will be

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:50,290
across all of the open source landscape

00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,510
that you're using within Genesis has the

00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,419
engineering team had the opportunity to

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,120
contribute back to any of the open

00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:01,210
source that you are consuming

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,340
we have but we've not done that we've

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,990
been able to finishing in console mr.

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,840
chair we were waiting to become official

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,860
members so I think it's probably worth

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,049
noting as well we have a recent hire

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:17,590
guidance it's shows our commitment and

00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:20,830
why we imp our finish and the open

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,799
source initiatives that also had NIC

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,720
Colver join us as well so we're looking

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,679
forward to Nick being more and more it

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,240
continued always doing which is

00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,929
obviously a major lead amazing leader

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,760
with a huge stream around at FTC 3 so we

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,679
also continue to see contributions in

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,380
that space of what's happening in that

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,029
space and we'll do more so ourselves but

00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,870
yeah you'll see from the other finis

00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,029
initiatives that would start

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,940
contributing on those finished specific

00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:47,380
initiatives as well so yes we are one we

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,970
were doing those in more not non

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:54,070
finished in US open source initiatives

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,590
but for the final specific ones Nick

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,210
joining us as well as things which are

00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,590
really really have been key for us and

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,779
we wanted to concentrate now we are

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,789
finally members were definitely

00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:05,799
contributing in the kind of financial

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:07,390
objects cloud and data masking and

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,700
others wherever we can we obviously want

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:13,090
to contribute and a number of our

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,039
clients already famous members and in

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,870
some cases a number of our clients are

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,690
of the leadership of different

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:25,360
philosophy initiatives so the answer is

00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:28,960
yes and yes if this that's brilliant and

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,700
I'd like to welcome Nick to the genesis

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,710
