00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,840
Eastern today we are fortunate to have

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,010

who's going to be speaking on the topic

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,410
of improving the impact of enterprise

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,170
open source development participation

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,829
Emer name please feel free to go ahead

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,079

really thankful and grateful for for

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,659
being invited to speak with to you and

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:12,030
with you about open source kind of

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,400
enterprise development my background you

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,799
know has been you know of my education

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
I'm an engineer I I studied computer

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
science and I have a PhD in computer

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,369
science and throughout my experience for

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,280
the past two plus decades I've been

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,630
focused or my work has been focused

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,360
across multiple company all around kind

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,840
of using and creating software in open

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,360
source and using these components as

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,670
enabling technologies that can be in you

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,170
know infrastructure telecom

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,119
infrastructure at Ericsson and Motorola

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:53,009
or on the mobile side at Samsung and Tom

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:56,670
and I've led open source engineering

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,460
team and established pospos open source

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,850
program offices and my last experience

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,939
with that was Samsung where I spent six

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,660
years and I created and launched the

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:13,200
open source group there today at the LF

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,950
I need the Alafaya Foundation which is

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,620
a foundation focused on accelerating the

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,340
development any critical open source AI

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,330
projects my talk today is actually a

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:32,250
spin-off of a talk I did a defense event

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,530
in November in New York and the genesis

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,900
of of that talk comes from different

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,080
conversations I've had with a lot of

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,750
people on you know how companies they

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,030
have the opportunity you know companies

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,250
they entertain open source from

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,940
different industries have the

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,130
opportunity to look back and examine you

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,380
know how other company is starting from

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,599
the early 2000 can involve open source

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:04,680
and learn from their practices you know

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,180
experience and and kind of look at the

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,209
errors these companies made in the early

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,640
days and avoid them today and also look

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,360
at what worked well and kind of adopt

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,310
that so so this was kind of the talk I

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,220
did that famous event and I kind of

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,819
expanded a little bit today since the

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,090
offensive end was limited to 25 minutes

00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:31,230
so as you can see I have I have a chart

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:34,470
now from a Linux Foundation a new stock

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,620
cooperation survey and I'll be putting a

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,440
few of these throughout the talk and

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,000
just so that you know all these survey

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,940
result I actually available on github

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,410
from the t-tube group so you can and get

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,440
all these charts from there so basically

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:55,139
part of the survey was a question about

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,620
you know where does your company or

00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:01,019
organization is on the open-source

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,760
journey and you can see the question

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,370
where companies are consuming

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,200
contributing a bunch of new projects and

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,639
what's interesting you know just jump in

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,289
on I'm not actually standing on the

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,530
share so Simon I think this is an issue

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,299
with just a couple of users and and what

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,030
you know what we used to login

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,130
I told others are able to see it but

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,960
I've also sent around the slides so you

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,430
should have them in your

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,139
oh thanks out Oh

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,250
so I assume you're able some people are

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:38,300
able to see it right yeah we can see it

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,990
thank you

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:47,479
so um something on my screen okay so

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,550
yeah what's interesting about that is if

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,240
you look at the results of that basic

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,340
question large tech companies with over

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,139
10,000 employees are a lot more foreign

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,849
talents in consuming contributing

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,130
collaborating on each mini project and

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:04,610
so on and we'll be talking about these

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,430
companies and what they do so one really

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,840
interesting thing is you know the

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,479
benefits of open source I'm gonna go

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,210
quickly on that we all are aware of kind

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:18,560
of development speed the ability to

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,400
customize code you know security

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,130
benefits

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,699
performance and and so on over one of

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:28,069
the area's I like to emphasize not just

00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,370
kind of on the purely tactical side of

00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:34,430
benefits but also the strategic value of

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,070
open source and typically I illustrate

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,560
this in kind of six different areas

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,570
first one is you know you look at open

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,110
source is just another tool in your

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:49,430
toolbox where you collaborate with

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,469
academia you work with PCs you kind of

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,240
support startups and cooperate with them

00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:55,400
and open source and of course you have

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,580
your internal R&T and all of these are

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,650
tools for your in innovation and on

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,050
products and services and open source is

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,300
just one of these tools also open

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,639
sources is gonna be critical you know

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,270
we're all famous you know aware of the

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,909
famously and you know from adhesion from

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,669
work and listen on you know software is

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:19,389
eating the world that was about ten

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:23,090
years ago and today we see open source

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:25,120
as eating the software by being off you

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,159
know under that large software umbrella

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,370
the largest part of that software being

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,949
created is actually open source so you

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,510
have to be you want to be good at

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:37,760
software you have to be good in open

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,700
source of course the flexible licensing

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,740
licensing you know

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,160
I mentioned I was at Samsung for for six

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,200
years and product dependency is

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,900
exceedingly strong argument in favor of

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,960
open source involvement so this is

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,790
actually the bottom-left product

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,510
dependency is actually a slide I used to

00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,550
use when I was at Samsung of when I do

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,880
my fundraising as you know open source

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,010
teams are kind of a cost Center and

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,830
every year we need you to go and raise

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,590
money and what but the argument to fund

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,930
us when every single product we ship

00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,290
actually contains code coming from open

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,980
source anywhere between 20 to 80 percent

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:24,380
right of course product enabled others

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,300
what I call direct able and an indirect

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,830
enablement there's a lot of support that

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,890
comes from open sourced products in

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:35,150
different ways and I feel from here with

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:36,770
the Pareto principle very funny open

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,990
source is actually great innovation

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,000
neighbor from that perspective while

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,490
you're able to get 80% of the left from

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,190
open source and that will allow you to

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,830
focus your 20

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,200
your your your engineers and your

00:07:48,830 --> 00:08:01,250
efforts on the 20% that are the critical

00:07:51,200 --> 00:08:04,430
value of so so basically the bottom line

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,460
is that smart companies really have I

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,190
need to have a notice or strategy and

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:15,490
it's not something open-source that you

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,490
can ignore today in today's environment

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,920
so what one it is thinking as a

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,700
follow-up to that is the rise of open

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:30,020
source program offices as you may be

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,820
aware in the past few years we've heard

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,490
a lot about companies establishing over

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,050
source program offices it used to be

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,770
called different names of source groups

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:42,590
of source Brunell office or other names

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:44,630
and what's really interesting is these

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,840
offices existed in one way shape or form

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,630
even from early 2000 and IBM was the

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,270
first in 2002 a Linux Technology Center

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,840
as you see until established their own

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,300
there

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,210
they're Center OTC open source

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:03,200
Technology Center in 2002 and actually I

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:06,770
was at Ericsson research in 2000 and we

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,620
created the open open systems lab so

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,600
it's actually a lab it's called a lot

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,170
because you know we are in research

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,650
focused on using open technologies to to

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:24,050
support the currently telecom harder

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:27,170
that we you know we create so today even

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,180
in finance I'm aware of the companies

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,340
who set up this office and hired some

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,020
people to turn it and some other

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,420
companies that are actually in the

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,760
hiring process to try and leaders for

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,410
that and these are officers typically

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,550
that are responsible for everything open

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,400
source within the company from

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,500
consumption to contribution to policies

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:51,080
processes to tooling you know kind of

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,660
awareness outreach and and so on

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,690
so they act as kind of the clearinghouse

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,820
of open source within the organization

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,400
and typically if we look at a company's

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,190
journey in open source they typically

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,560
start consuming open source and as a

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,510
result of consuming open source and you

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,400
know as when a building a product or

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,960
gaining service then they move into

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,550
setting up a compliance program because

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,610
you know once they shipped the product

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,290
they have to comply and then typically

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,220
they start participating and different

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,980
community is contributing and then they

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,690
aim to gain a leadership position in

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,970
different communities or projects that

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,770
are critical to their product and you

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,450
not see this chart in different ways if

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,090
a company is you know they they come

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,710
Felicity they're each Union you know

00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,440
different keywords but this is kind of

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:45,020
basically the path that most companies

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,270
go through and you cannot just jump in

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:51,110
to become a leader on this kind of you

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:54,680
go and kind of you know you start from

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:57,410
the bottom up and building your of your

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,150
position and typically you know at the

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,150
beginning from a consumption perspective

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,410
a lot of companies you know a lot you

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,450
know some executives may not be aware

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,750
but the consumption part is usually

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,150
german engineers are you know part of

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,040
that ecosystem there they'd like to

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:18,480
reuse code go and see what's out there

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:23,340
and try to adapt it and as it as the the

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,110
adoption becomes more involved and wider

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,770
within the company it becomes kind of

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:34,140
more driven by by by business strategy

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:36,180
and other factors and typically were the

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,950
first one which is the first phase

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,970
goodness which is the kind of vertical

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:43,770
suction part you know it is companies

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,480
and you know start using open source

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,400
because it gives them you know different

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,080
advantages or basically the developers

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,800
within the company start using open

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,540
source you know for four different

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,700
advantages whether it's you know the

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,220
availability of functionality that is

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:06,180
out there you know readiness you know

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:08,730
the features and so on and for gaining

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,120
and selling out that kind of healthy

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,120
consumption environment typically

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,740
companies need to create you know what I

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,350
would call kind of different supporting

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,330
elements within the company to enable to

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,800
enable that you know both on the

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,970
consumption and compliance side because

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,350
I see them go together and that includes

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,820
different different aspects as you can

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,000
see on the slide there is company

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,080
strategy part kind of very basic stuff

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,830
like the portal

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,320
policy and process for using open source

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:43,050
and for compliance purposes integrating

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,110
compliance as part of the development

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:50,160
process setting up the team in this case

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:53,460
for a focus on ensuring compliance a lot

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,840
of Education right on you know company

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,550
policies training on licenses different

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,250
checklist in a different check for

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,240
creating checkpoints and in different

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:08,940
processes even on development processes

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,710
saying up the tooling and in some cases

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,470
participating in different industry

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,340
initiative that support the consumption

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,340
and compliance plans

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,420
and you know I at least the companies

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,600
I've been GI 40 like six seven companies

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,480
in last few years and you know start

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,010
with that and then we kind of

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,200
automatically start drifting into

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,930
participating different projects and

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,190
contributing to them and once you get to

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:40,950
that point then you need to adjust and

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,950
include and support additional kind of

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,780
building blocks for a near eternal open

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,850
source infrastructure and by transaction

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,370
but I don't mean kind of idea

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,650
infrastructure just you know processes

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,050
and policies and training and guidelines

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,590
and truly kind of to enable that

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,730
participation and the contribution on

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,420
the one you know when you get to the

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,730
contribution part you you know most

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,660
companies all they have a certain policy

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:13,110
that guides the contributions they have

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,600
either process for that and at that

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,060
point companies start evaluating hey you

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,460
know whether they should have an

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,540
open-source program office or you know

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,510
some kind of of team that oversees the

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,390
company's involvement and open source

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,470
projects and and obviously their

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,600
[Music]

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,790
participation in foundations and and so

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,790
on and this is where kind of fee the

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:42,420
concept of also comes in vacated grouped

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:44,700
focused on you know everything open

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,280
source took in the company and in some

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,780
cases here depending on what the company

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,570
works in which domain in which

00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:55,350
technology for its vertical us in some

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,570
cases you start also getting involved in

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,250
standardization aspects and providing a

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,210
locus or service implementation and

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,710
whatnot and in many cases this is kind

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,610
of a collaboration between our suppose

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,530
and the Vice product teams and of course

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,160
either ship you know once you get to

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,350
that point

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,390
this requires kind of increased

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,980
investments across the board from you

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:23,310
know additionally you needs to work on a

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:25,080
few projects to kind of have in case of

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,050
headcount and maybe project management

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,139
in proving the process of you ask for

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,829
you know

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:36,430
is on the strategy side on the

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:39,160
foundation side and so on I basically

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,560
when you look at these different phases

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,860
you know moving from consumers butts

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,470
further and up to the kind of leader and

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,629
of course you know you cannot be kind of

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,949
quite a cult leader in general here you

00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,899
know companies lived in different

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:56,139
projects and fit communities you can be

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:58,269
a leader in in few communities and kind

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:00,910
of a consumer and for others and you

00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,069
know basic contributor in some other

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,579
projects as well right so it's not kind

00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:08,319
of a global umbrella and as you move

00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,089
from it for awaiting key using and the

00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:14,800
point is as we show on the chart you

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:17,560
know e transition automatically from one

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,360
phase into the earth into another with

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,490
additional involvement in the investment

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,750
in these different projects that you

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:31,569
care about and what's really interesting

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,420
you know on the financial side or

00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:37,060
financial services according to be

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:41,649
survey the financial industry in general

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:44,800
is a heavy user of open source and lets

00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,120
off a contributor however you know at

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,490
least from the interactions we've been

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,120
having the past few months and by the

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:55,750
way this survey that is six months old

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,939
so this is changing and we're seeing

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,160
it's just by the fact of how many

00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,870
financial companies out there that are

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,589
involved in in females are actually

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,970
hiring to lunch

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,159
their hope is for program offices or

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:13,360
have already done so so this there's

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:16,689
really a lot of optimism in maybe next

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,640
year or in end of 2020 to see the

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:23,799
financial services industry higher on

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,770
the contributions all right so some of

00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,380
the recommended practices so going back

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,720
to what I mentioned earlier in the talk

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,690
about kind of looking at these different

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,940
companies that that enter the open

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,039
source domain you know maybe twenty

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,840
eight and fifteen years ago and have

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,020
done really well so looking at that I

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,260
thank you

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,480
you know what have they done that worked

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,240
for them and this is basically where I'm

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,800
listening these different practices so

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,840
creating an open source program office

00:17:51,800 --> 00:18:00,020
this is really one of my favorite things

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:02,600
to do as an individual working companies

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,600
is to go and set up the office and hired

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,390
for it and build the company's practices

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,160
in open source and so on and you can see

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:18,230
that you know from the survey result you

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:20,120
know very high positive impact resulting

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,000
from from company creating that open

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,730
source program and and also you know as

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,250
I mentioned earlier you know the finance

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,670
financial services industry is up there

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,180
in terms of getting involved and

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:38,270
following that path of setting up that

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,220
offers that matches their open source

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:43,220
presents and activities and

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,530
contributions higher automotive either

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,590
for open source office you definitely

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,970
need a leader for it you know looking

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,100
just how open source is kind of

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,500
grassroot within the company until it

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,880
becomes of certain importance I mean

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,710
it's taking over my business strategy

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,590
you know there are typically a lot of

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,750
people within the company that have

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,390
driven that adoption internally to a

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,380
point where it became physical and 4004

00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,880
an office so one of the things I always

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,220
mentioned to you two companies I work

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,550
with is you know try to identify talent

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,470
within your company and you know for

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,560
that for that kind of that leadership

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,630
position because in most cases you as a

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,330
company wouldn't have reached the

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,510
tipping point of thinking and wanting to

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,090
establish your source office without a

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,920
lot of for it that yeah one of

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,290
developers or others have done within

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,140
the company so it's it's an talent fight

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,360
down there identify you realizing open

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,770
source software so this is actually one

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,080
of the early exercises that most

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,390
companies come through in terms of ok

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,040
where where are we using open source how

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,290
many components do we have and try to

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,220
identify kind of the open source builds

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:57,220
material which is basically the listing

00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,490
of all log source are components used

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:03,240
across all products and services and

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,909
this is really a great starting point

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,100
where you go through that prioritization

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:11,500
exercise as well where of course you

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,870
know having worked at Samsung and

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,630
Motorola and HP and others you know we

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,179
use thousands of open-source components

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,150
however we don't have resources to focus

00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:24,490
on all thousands of these component so

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,370
going through the exercise of I didn't

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,679
find what components we use and where

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,840
and what's their criticality to our

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,350
products and services and we follow

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,130
certain grading scheme all that exercise

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:42,690
helps us to pinpoint it you know the top

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:46,090
25 50 components that are critical to us

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:49,150
we would be severely affected if these

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:52,419
communities don't continue to thrive and

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,659
grow and that gives us the guidelines on

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:57,090
where we should invest our kind of

00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:01,510
resources in a head count

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:04,240
so this is this is one of you for it

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,960
another view is as they had of the open

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,640
source program office typically you know

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,520
you're extremely restricted in had

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,080
cattle and and these sources and you

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,380
want to make sure that whatever

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,380
investment you do will eat the most

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,760
results and myself I've haven't gone

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,250
through this multiple times

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,490
I always favored investing in open

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,530
source communities that where these

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,750
projects are being used by at least two

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,140
business units or two products which

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,340
gives me as a head of AuSable kind of

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,740
comes redundancy from a funding

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,490
perspective and also gives me it kind of

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:45,309
2 for 1 or 3 for one where we do with

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,890
you kind of we invest in the project and

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,559
that project gives resolved for multiple

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,760
products right so increasing our our

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,929
impact internally within the company

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,020
identify hide the target of a source

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:01,390
position so a lot of company is you know

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:05,200
some of them or extremely large that

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:07,499
companies are very satisfied just being

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,869
as a as a consumer right

00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:14,259
others want to become a leader and want

00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:16,119
to exercise influence and have these

00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,679
outbursts become committers and

00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:21,700
maintenance and different communities

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,099
that they rely on on them so so I think

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,529
one of the exercises that exceed be

00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:29,679
useful is done in 5k where you are today

00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:31,809
on that scheme and where do you want to

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,079
get and kind of chart a path from

00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:37,539
current position to desired position and

00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:41,909
that basically your strategy and create

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:45,279
tactical plan for that and you know each

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:47,019
each position as mentioned in previous

00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,029
slide quite differently past nodes an

00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:52,119
action plan but that gives you kind of

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:56,379
it's not important or of you know we've

00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,789
looked at the company today we're the

00:22:56,379 --> 00:23:00,749
way the open source components in these

00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:04,839
different products and we have you know

00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:07,989
spread across these kids and our goal is

00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:10,599
to become you know a leader in these

00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:12,369
projects and we're gonna our goal is to

00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,320
become kind of contributor and these

00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:15,999
other communities and for the other

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,209
concern critical project we're gonna

00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:21,849
remain a consumer right without any any

00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:23,950
contribution to this project and that

00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:26,649
gives you kind of a lot a lot to work

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,299
with developing executed oversaw

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,829
strategy which is kind of a sum of

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:31,899
everything I've said so far in the past

00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:35,739
few for the first few slide and that

00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:39,239
involves kind of a relation to technical

00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:41,200
work to aspect to legal on the licensing

00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:44,109
aspects in relation to products

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,389
ecosystem development and a lot of

00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:49,059
business consideration and that relates

00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:52,839
directly to your product a specific

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:55,149
company so a lot of so I put up here

00:23:52,839 --> 00:24:00,639
some questions just comes to provoke

00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:03,549
thought on what in you know what entails

00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:05,940
be you know thinking about strategy you

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:08,289
know how can I access your organization

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,379
how can achieve your corporate goals

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,999
right I mean a lot of companies even I

00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:14,409
don't know if a single company that was

00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:17,319
involved in open source because these

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:19,089
years find it fun and it's like cool and

00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,720
things like that I it's all about bottom

00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:22,870
lines

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,870
accelerating product you know leveraging

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:28,600
resources improving innovation and

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,730
cooperating with others and so on so

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,090
there are always kind of business

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,440
objective driving keys involvement and

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:41,049
you know the open source that she helped

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,850
you kind of and then 5yz and relate them

00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,419
to open source and kind of put a plan

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,429
for that

00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:49,690
how can open society help you achieve

00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:54,039
your piece - right and are you able to

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:55,419
use open source as a tool to create new

00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,409
opportunities that are otherwise

00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,990
intended

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,700
I mean think of providing a reference

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,860
implementation to a standard and

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,370
suddenly your implementation becomes

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,559
kind of a de-facto are used by everybody

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,510
else right that's you know that's a

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,340
great opportunity for you there so there

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,890
are a lot of things innovation talks are

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,919
sexy and you know sometimes I feel

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:23,679
saying up sausage is kind of too wide of

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:29,289
a map to talk these questions can help

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:32,650
you frame your mind and like implement

00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:34,630
an enabling environment that includes

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:39,840
everything from policies processes

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:44,020
tooling getting involved in foundations

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,030
competitive and so on and you know give

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,710
you an idea you know when I joined

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:53,770
Samsung in 2013 I was the first hire and

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,809
I was hired to establish kind of you

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:59,020
know the open source organization

00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:01,000
builder up and at that point you know

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,120
Samsung was not known as a company

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,330
nonetheless being a software contributor

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,669
and open source and you know you know I

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,700
joined and what was really interesting

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,750
is you know there was kind of no

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,840
standard laptop

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:20,950
Linux laptop issue there's no you know

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,929
VPN support there's no IMAP email you

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,000
need to go if you want to go through

00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,700
github you need to request to the github

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,429
website you need to request

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:33,140
firewall exception I mean it was really

00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:35,930
a nightmare right and by no mean

00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,700
each of the developer nonetheless

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,810
open-source author wants to be in that

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,940
environment and it took me about a year

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:48,410
kind of to change that and move from

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,240
that extremely limited environment where

00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,080
it's excruciating for an officer's

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,150
developer to learn into a much more open

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,210
environment and you know and in my case

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:02,390
I just moved the IT infrastructure for

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,370
the open source team into AWS yeah you

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,200
know just as an example and and we

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:10,100
opened up everything so we had our own

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,950
good servers wiki you know I even had an

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:16,910
IRC server we had our own emailing

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:20,510
system so I was giving him at osg don't

00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:23,360
work right so so the whole point is you

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:26,210
know try to identify friction point and

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,280
kind of remover and the whole idea is to

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:32,450
enable open source within the company

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,100
and kind of not to restrict provide a

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,470
flexible I think environment I think I

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:40,370
mentioned that you know we you know we

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,440
were in 2020 and still we face ite our

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,030
restrictions especially when it comes to

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,520
the different trolling allowed within

00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,260
the company but then you know the tools

00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,410
that we may be using once inside the

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,700
company we need other tools you know for

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,760
collaboration purposes which people

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,130
outside the company and so on so so look

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,810
at your IT environment and and ask

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,210
yourself the question you know what can

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:04,400
we prove there to make it easier for our

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:09,380
developers and to make their their

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:13,040
workflow much more smooth and and kind

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,840
of intent and easy lay and execute on

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,420
that and and kind of improve that IT

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,110
infrastructure built expertise and key

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:24,290
of his force technical areas ecosystem

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,870
communities actually all that and one of

00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,190
the very effective ways that I found

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,590
throughout the years in different

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,420
companies was you know starting by

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,280
having kind of what I call an anchor and

00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,280
I get higher you know if you don't have

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,440
expertise in currently health and we're

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,570
not gonna go hire 50 kernel developers

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,380
first they don't exist I get extremely

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:46,370
hard and then you're gonna still have

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,470
the problem

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:52,040
also what I found that works to do well

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,840
is to I want to key developers in

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,800
specific areas that we want to build up

00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:02,210
and jump out and have them training and

00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:06,260
mentor kind of less experienced

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:09,500
developers and that work as a way for us

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,600
to to kind of scale our experience and

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,790
our expertise in a specific domain

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,960
because obviously we cannot go and hire

00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,880
everybody and so we just hired a couple

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,040
of people and have them help us put that

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,230
expertise and it's not just technical

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,850
it's you know people who know how to

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,760
work with foundations people who know

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,450
how to stop you know different software

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,190
strategy participate with with other

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:38,410
software leaders within the company and

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:41,360
and be part of the kind of division of

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,910
where we want to go as part of our

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,059
transformation from whatever company

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,660
into software driven company create

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:51,679
meaningful metrics to to track progress

00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,350
you know if you can't measure it you

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,460
can't improve it but also there are a

00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:01,250
lot of challenges when it comes to kind

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,070
of measuring and K coming up with

00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:09,830
metrics for open-source developers and

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:11,780
the example I often give is if you if

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:16,250
you want to implement a feature to

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,290
improve battery life you know or you

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,410
basically G to improve power management

00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,270
in the kernel and you assign that to to

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,540
a couple of your developers working on

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,520
the kernel and you know eight eight

00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,280
months ten months later they come in and

00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,929
they say well this is implemented but

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,500
they haven't taught the core themselves

00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:38,059
right I mean they they started these

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,550
questions on a mailing list they were

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,679
able to motivate others and then it

00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,809
became kind of a community effort

00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,230
it was very very little code coming from

00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:49,640
them or so then how would you when it

00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,770
comes to the forest management how do

00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,900
you manage that okay well you know they

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,850
didn't actually implement it completely

00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,320
or they didn't do it by themselves but

00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,160
they motivated others and they worked

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,370
with other companies

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:05,630
pickles to get it done so and you know

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:08,090
another example is you know also from

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:11,090
Samsung is when you know I joined in

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,880
they you know my management in Korea is

00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,530
Sarah me you know set of metrics that I

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,010
need to meet and one of them is number

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:22,000
of matches which was kind of pretty

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:24,740
useless because you know you can have

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,090
somebody produce it doesn't touch a year

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,890
of very little technical value and

00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,590
somebody else create you know produce

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,350
you know twenty patches for that same

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,780
period of time of really high impact and

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,400
high technical value but following these

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,840
metrics the person who produced a

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:48,290
thousand touch will will get you higher

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,880
bonus and you know they would be

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,890
promoted to then the company and all

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,720
that while the person who produced the

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,300
most meaningful work just because the

00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,180
number of patches the net up right so um

00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,460
so all of that just to say you know you

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:05,480
know it's a hard exercise to come up

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,970
with meaningful metrics and there are

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,130
actually a lot of literature out there

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,720
coming from different impose and in

00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:14,990
different companies on how they work

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,140
with Latics and I had it remind you you

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:21,560
you kind of look at that crate and

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:25,100
outsource office or singing personally

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,780
I'm a big believer of of training I've

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,040
established training courses on

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:33,800
compliance on open source development

00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:38,210
methodology and had my engineers create

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:40,070
trainings on the different projects we

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,610
you know we focus on you know from the

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:46,640
kernel to J steamer to web engines you

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:50,240
know X Y Z and we used to deliver these

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,410
trainings keys to junior developers and

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,390
mentor them and you know within six to

00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,750
eight months we were able to see really

00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:02,770
high impact in terms of much improved

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:05,000
code but also in some cases developers

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,890
graduating in the kind of open source

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,470
communities to become in commerce and in

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:13,309
the different areas so training and

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:15,740
mentoring combined together and set in a

00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:18,580
serious environment actually can can

00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,600
yield two very positive results

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:24,669
establish relationship with officers

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,350
Foundation a lot of the officers project

00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,610
companies rely on and you know critical

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,070
projects are actually hosting

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,860
foundations you know from the Apache

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:37,130
until the next donation and others so

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,049
and one way to to support these projects

00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,020
really and to drive funding to them in

00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:45,049
some cases is to get involved with the

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,120
foundation and be part of the efforts

00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:49,669
and the advice committee to set up and

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,159
your in terms you know within that

00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:54,409
specific foundations so one of these

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,840
slices I always recommend a survey

00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:59,630
project figure out which project hosted

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,870
at which foundation and kind of set up a

00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:06,159
plan on getting involved there based on

00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:09,020
your requirements and your priorities

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,679
established framework for open sourcing

00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,450
internal code this is part of kind of

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,389
contributing there are kind of two paths

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,220
for contributing you contribute code

00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,980
that was created for the purpose of

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,159
being upstream but also you have a lot

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,659
of existing code that was created

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,000
intentionally created to be proprietary

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,639
code and over time we realized that

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,889
there is value in making this code

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,570
open-source okay so how do you go about

00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:39,740
this because it's a different process

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:43,310
then your kernel engineer who's ID code

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,470
every day and was kind of an approval

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,480
blanket on everything they write to make

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,070
it open source so there has to be some

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,919
kind of a framework to guide the

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:54,050
decision on this is internal propriety

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,600
code it's already in production in

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,570
different places we want to take it

00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,550
cleaner up announce it as an open source

00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,830
project and trying to development in the

00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,900
open so how do you do that and this is

00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,590
what I mean by framework there has to be

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,900
some process and policy then that guide

00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,119
our decision and some due diligence

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,570
exercise that goes through the various

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,830
technical business

00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:23,190
and in some cases legal questions that

00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:28,950
will arise from from from that and I

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:31,410
just encourage cooperation eternal

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,210
cooperation and enable and Yannick

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,940
sourcing so inner sourcing has been in

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,730
careful hot keyword for the past few

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,330
years which is basically the practice of

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,980
working out resource practices

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:47,520
development practices that that have

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,620
worked really well in the open to foster

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,350
and kind of enabled that cooperation

00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:55,170
across geographies

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,600
across companies and so on and learn

00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,970
from them and try to import them is that

00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:06,000
the company and adopt them in internal

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:09,660
development so one of the ways and you

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,680
know as from personal experience having

00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,330
adopted inner sourcing or some of the

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,640
you know in resourcing practices in

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,670
different companies one of the side

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,670
benefit we get was all the kind of new

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,620
hires we get all the university

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,050
graduates that come to us as new hires

00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,830
we don't have any previous experience in

00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:34,350
open source they get kind of trained on

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:38,310
the open third source way of doing

00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:40,350
things internally just by you know using

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,600
inner source practices that are within

00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:46,140
the company and within a few months

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,940
they're actually well trained to be open

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,520
source developers in that sense right so

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,230
so they come in and they see how we're

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,220
doing things and transitioning them

00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:57,900
toward also project is kind of not that

00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,960
hard because they already know how to

00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,020
work a meaningless there are any work

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,460
cd1 with github they you know and they

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,530
know how to work with people outside of

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,620
different time zone and things like that

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,510
so there are a lot of different benefits

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,510
to adopting inner sourcing then then

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,090
just the diet manifests that that you

00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:20,640
would get by state and most open source

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,880
event can be visible they must show your

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:28,140
work meet the co-operators you work with

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,800
seek new ones and you know I work

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,850
underneath

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,840
and hostess hands and we have a number

00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:39,260
of companies who are it's eally good at

00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,000
kind of participating in this event sir

00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,480
you know they are at every single events

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,820
some companies and then 20 30 40 people

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,150
and these are these events are already a

00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,220
great place to network and meet me

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,710
people and and try to explore

00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,540
opportunities for corporations others

00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:01,740
and you know I was at the fearless

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:04,710
events for two days in November I don't

00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,570
know and really a great event I met a

00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,130
lot of people that otherwise I would

00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:12,510
have never met different industry is

00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,790
hosted a couple new cooperation that

00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,890
otherwise wouldn't have happened right

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:20,370
and I consider myself an experienced

00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,320
person so imagine for a soft developer

00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,830
who's working on a new project and

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,690
trying to say it what they're doing you

00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,940
know having you know giving them the

00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,160
opportunity to do this at a stage in

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,270
front of other developers is really

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,890
extremely useful establish office or IT

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:43,470
projects University is this kind of a

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:46,200
hidden kind of hidden gem in a way where

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:50,070
I don't think companies do enough of

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,330
that and I was lucky to establish some

00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,860
of these cooperation in the past few

00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:59,280
years and it was really eye-opening to

00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:04,200
me the amazing talent that exists today

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:07,560
in the universities so we you know one

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,830
of the practices I would highly consider

00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,550
is you know explore computer science

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:17,010
programs in universities near you can

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,050
visit them try to figure out how to get

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:22,800
involved with what I am either to intern

00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:25,860
internship or graduate projects and

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,150
generally just seek seek out cooperation

00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,520
with the professor's leading the

00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:33,890
different research there I've had

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:37,650
personally multiple collaborations with

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:38,460
fantastic results out of that so please

00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,130
take a lot

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,680
update outsourcing agreements and their

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:47,240
a practices and so on this is kind of a

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,730
compliance from a compliance perspective

00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,000
as you work with third-party software

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:57,780
providers and other companies delivering

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,700
software here most of your outsourcing

00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,060
or supply chain agreements need to be

00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,530
updated to make sure that profile

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,290
software providers or even hardware

00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:10,260
providers during you hardware with

00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:11,640
drivers this you know provides all the

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,470
disclaimers in relation to all the

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,970
source and are in compliance when they

00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:19,410
actually deliver the protein you are

00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:22,020
thinking for how many practices it turns

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:26,010
off you know acquisitions or or mergers

00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:29,849
or anything of that sort and I think

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:32,310
this might be my last kind of practice

00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:34,619
or conf recommendation is jointly to do

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,440
group some of you may be aware of it

00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:42,330
it's it's a group operating under the

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:45,330
Linux Foundation umbrella of maybe close

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:48,750
to maybe 80 companies now or something

00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:50,940
like that that most of these companies

00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,730
either have an open-source program

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,800
office or actually are in the process of

00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:59,550
building one and they joined the ETD

00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,560
group which is kind of the collection of

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:07,140
companies with open source offices and

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:09,270
it works as as a group of peers where

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,609
they cooperate on the different projects

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:14,609
they're working on they exchange best

00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:16,890
practices they they work on common

00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:21,660
problems facing open source program

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:23,880
offices in general and so on so if you

00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,349
have a open source program office or

00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,800
even if you don't have one for planning

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:31,380
to do one this is really great group to

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,080
join those there are no fees or anything

00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,810
I got it's just a mailing list and

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,430
github repo and website and they have

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:42,300
their own events they need frequently

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:46,589
face to face the other calls and so on

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:49,740
so please check the website I think it's

00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:52,490
a great resource that is available at

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,490
your finger prints

00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,200
and formalizing open-source carry past

00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:01,259
this was very interesting in the past

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,410
two companies I worked at we're where

00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:07,910
the company you know where I worked with

00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:10,380
hrg formalized kind of a local source

00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,940
position versus kind of software

00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,299
developer and I think the lines are

00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,640
becoming more blurry as as the month and

00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:21,359
the year progress but you know in the

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:26,250
past you know for five years we did that

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,160
and it was a way for us to to force a

00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:32,390
new new way of relating engineers and a

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,740
new way of promotion and so our custom

00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:39,779
engineers were being promoted based on

00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:42,720
product achievement based on and they

00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:44,849
were rewarded based on product sales or

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,119
product you know shipping on time I

00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:49,680
think like that and that these metrics

00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,579
don't specifically apply to open-source

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,019
developers who are mostly focused on

00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,269
working with people outside of the

00:42:55,019 --> 00:43:00,990
company and not necessarily on product

00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:05,869
so we had to break break that these

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:08,339
metrics and these kind of way of

00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:10,470
rewarding engineers at the company and

00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:12,990
the easiest path for for me at that

00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:15,089
point was to create kind of a new

00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,269
category of Engineers you know

00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:20,369
open-source developers that articles

00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:22,319
evaluated differently worded differently

00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:23,759
it was different expectation and

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,440
different promotional paths and that

00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:31,319
worked really well so as closing I think

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,109
from a resource perspective there are a

00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:35,430
lot of challenges you will as an

00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:37,529
industry you know finally you know

00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:40,880
financial sources and as individual

00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:45,509
companies you will go through as part of

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,460
using consuming you know contributing to

00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:49,650
open source projects and building that

00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,410
open-source presence and I think they

00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:54,569
can be classified in you know in five

00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:57,779
different pockets you may classify them

00:43:54,569 --> 00:44:02,279
differently you know culture processes

00:43:57,779 --> 00:44:03,990
doing continuity and education and

00:44:02,279 --> 00:44:06,109
within each

00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:09,839
this bucket there are different

00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:12,720
challenges that you know you either will

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,740
hit or you know you're lucky you know

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,589
your company is already there in terms

00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,430
of mindset that it's not gonna be a big

00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:21,599
challenge for you

00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:25,500
but these are kind of different

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,140
challenges you might go through and in

00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,540
your work and actually a lot of these

00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,950
challenges are things that the to do

00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:39,450
group looks at and try to identify way

00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:42,270
identify ways to to resolve them so for

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,300
me I think the four key pillars are you

00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,520
know consumption and compliance you know

00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:50,940
you know companies that being peers they

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,530
start using officers then they wake up

00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,869
one day and they're like oh my god we

00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:57,270
realize so much good stuff we need to

00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:59,609
patooty to participate in the process of

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:03,839
creating the code and be influential in

00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:05,910
this project and then it filters down to

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,780
you know okay these are the three

00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:11,670
critical projects that if these projects

00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,180
don't continue to thrive and grow will

00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:17,700
completely we will be completely hurt on

00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,170
the product and this is where you want

00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,700
to become a leader in these communities

00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:27,900
and I think you know when we look at

00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:30,780
open source in general the open source

00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,440
is eating the software word I said that

00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:37,080
earlier and we have two options one we

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,640
can sit and watch the show or we can

00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,810
actually be part of it and I very much

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,080
believe we should be part of the show

00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:48,390
and be part of creating and expanding

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:53,089
that ecosystem and you know I started

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,089
working on sores in the late night in

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,790
1919 19th right but then I moved to

00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,650
become paid of source device at McLean

00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:07,560
as a developer in the late 90s early

00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:09,420
2000s and I've seen different technology

00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,570
sectors the for the industry yield to

00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,330
open source first in the telecom in the

00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,190
back end was a control of any mobile

00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:19,069
site

00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:20,780
and wouldn't be you know of course the

00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:23,180
web my internet back then then

00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,150
throughout the years you know with

00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,430
different technology verticals and now

00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,200
you know finance is one of many tours

00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:32,180
finance there is energy and there's

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,930
healthcare are gonna be three top

00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:39,349
runners where we see open source

00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:41,630
creating the next wave and I would love

00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:44,359
to be in your shoes and sense where you

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,579
have the opportunity to to to create

00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,650
that and establish all the sources in

00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:53,530
your organization in a new vertical is

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:56,150
extremely exciting and silly motivating

00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:57,859
so as a for instance there are a lot of

00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:01,190
references you can it hurt you I think

00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:05,599
the group has a fantastic set of car

00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:07,730
I think they have maybe 10 to 12 guides

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,800
that that were created by the different

00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:13,130
leaders of open source groups within

00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:16,609
their membership and their excavation

00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:21,230
also have plenty of publications on our

00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:24,020
topic so as just before I close so one

00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:27,950
of the interesting of we've done an a

00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:30,740
foundation is and I'm doing this

00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:32,329
actually next week for us energy of

00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,890
energy is our new umbrella foundation

00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:39,470
focused on open source in the energy

00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:42,349
sector is creating what we call kind of

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:45,770
an open source boot camp and I have here

00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:47,810
a screenshot of the schedule and you

00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:51,560
know from an energy perspective you know

00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:53,839
the company's was the creating the

00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,810
energy and disappearing energy they're

00:47:53,839 --> 00:48:00,619
they're absolutely not not software

00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:02,900
driven and not binding in anywhere close

00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:04,960
to being an open source consumer and

00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,609
we're kind of fortunately on

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,800
transforming and unlocking these

00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:12,680
potentials in the energy sector so the

00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,589
schedule you see on the screen some

00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,440
parts of it are very beginner right but

00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:21,020
when I'm when I'm trying to communicate

00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:25,190
with you now is if this is of interest

00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:28,569
we can certainly work with you on aiding

00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:30,999
kind of an open source bootcamp focused

00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:34,359
for the financial industry or financial

00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:38,079
services industry and focused on topics

00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:40,689
that are of interest to you at the level

00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,509
that you'd like and we can cooperate on

00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:47,919
making it you know half-day or day and

00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:49,900
it can be I think a great place for you

00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:53,499
know not more conference time but more

00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:56,019
of a workshop style just the thought so

00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:58,269
this is actually my last slide again

00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:00,689
thank you so much for the opportunity to

00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:03,759
speak and I think we have plenty of time

00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:10,660
if you have any questions that you'd

00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:13,929
like to throw my way this is Erin I just

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:17,609
wanted to jump in and give one more

00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:21,239
resource that maybe Ibrahim was too

00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:23,799
humble to mention but he's written an

00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:26,410
incredibly valuable and comprehensive

00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:28,660
ebook called open source compliance in

00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:32,849
the enterprise that the Linux Foundation

00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:35,499
puts out as a free pdf download and it

00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:40,029
you know it covers just about everything

00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:42,519
that you'd want covered on setting up an

00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:44,619
open source program office and on your

00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,209
various compliance related obligations

00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:53,409
so I highly recommend checking that out

00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:55,900
as well does anyone have questions for

00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:58,949
Ibrahim note that you may have to unmute

00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,949
yourself to ask them

00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:26,420
