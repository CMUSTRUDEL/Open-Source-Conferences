[Music]

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
there's been

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
a real growth in chilling projects that

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
have

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
started up around ftc3 to help support

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,640
development

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,359
one of those projects i'm going to demo

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,840
now

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,560
and that is the um chrome extension

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,600
project that

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,800
basically allows you to run the ftc 3

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
apis in chrome

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,040
which is what i'm going to cut over to

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,160
this is an open source project

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,680
that currently is just in my github

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,360
account um but you can see it there

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:56,160
and get it and play around with it

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,160
so one of the first things that

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,559
this chrome extension does and you can

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,080
see that it's running because

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,560
you get this um icon in chrome

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,360
that shows that you have the ftc3 agent

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
running

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,000
is that it injects the ftc3 api into

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,040
your chrome tabs

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
so if i inspect

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
i can see

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,799
that i have access to the ftc3 api

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,680
as a global and i can do things like

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
let's say

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,720
i want to call the find intent api for

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
the view chart intent

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,640
um this is now going to execute a search

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,479
against my app directory

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
and return a promise which will resolve

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,520
with

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,560
both the details about the intent as

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,960
well as a list of applications

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
that uh handle that intent

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,479
i can also do things like

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,960
get system channels and see all the

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,399
standard channels or the color channels

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,640
that

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,840
this particular desktop agent supports

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
i could then use that to

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
subscribe to a channel or to broadcast

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
on the channel as well

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
um and i can do things like join a

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
channel

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,319
so this is kind of interesting if you

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,680
look at this icon up here

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,360
when i joined the red channel it's now

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,200
showing me a badge

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
a red badge showing that i'm now on the

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,640
red channel

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
and i can broadcast a context onto that

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,239
channel

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,160
so if i just call ftc3 broadcast it's

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,760
now going to broadcast that

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
onto the red channel

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,200
so i can

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,280
see that by if i open my ui

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
here i can now search against my app

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,760
directory

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
and i can open up the channel manager

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,959
which is an app that

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,920
is just a demonstration

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,519
app that has been made available through

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,959
this app directory

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,959
um and now i can see all of my system

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,400
channels and i can see that

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
the um red channel has the context that

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
broadcast

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,840
onto it this also supports other

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,280
actions i can use within ftc3 so for

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,080
example i can now find

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,400
the intents and apps that are available

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,440
for this particular context

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,560
so if i want to um let's say i want to

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,879
view a chart

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,879
and i can select the trading view chart

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,000
and i now have

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,480
this chart loaded with the context that

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
was provided there ibm

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
what's also interesting is that i can

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,840
now

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,840
put this chart onto the red channel

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,760
and if i change the context

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,480
it's now going to reflect that here you

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
can see that now the

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,560
red channel context in my channel

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,599
manager has been updated

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
i want to copy that let's say for

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,280
argument's sake

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
and broadcast that over the orange

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,680
channel

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
and now if i change this

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
the red channel here has changed to

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
apple and if i change

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,440
now my chart to the orange channel which

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
has ib

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,720
microsoft i will now pick up that

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,000
context to my chart

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,479
um one other feature that you can

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,680
see here of channels is

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,680
the creation of

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
application channels so if i create a

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,919
new channel here

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,560
it's called foo this is called an

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,800
application channel so this is not

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,919
these are provided by the system the

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320
color ones but the

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,960
this is a custom channel that just my

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,880
application is created

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,720
but other applications can also

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,160
listen to it or participate in it so now

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:23,120
my second channel manager is also

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,120
connected to foo and now if i

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,160
update foo

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
and broadcast that my uh first

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
application

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,080
gets that update and i could you know

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,039
keep doing that

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,960
broadcasting back and forth so you can

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
see that the

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
application for this kind of these kinds

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
of channel apis

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
is pretty broad and there's a lot of

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,919
different things you can do

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,800
um i'm just going to cut over to a bit

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,160
of a more

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,440
financially specific demonstration

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
of of some of these features on the left

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,960
you should see

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
a grid that is actually coming from ag

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,319
grid

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,039
showing the s p 500

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,120
on the right you can see factset who has

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,160
implemented ftc3

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,880
uh and a fact set chart

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
so this grid is going to let me do a

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,680
number of different things with

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,240
fdc3 not just broadcasting context but

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,199
also raising intents

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
and discovering intents so first let's

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
try

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
raising an intent so right now i'm going

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,280
to raise

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,840
an intent for 3m called view chart

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
and what's going to happen is that i've

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,720
just said

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:48,240
hey i'm interested in this uh

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,759
in seeing a chart for this context

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:56,639
and i will

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,639
um get

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,800
this rate rise raises up to my

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,039
ftc3 agent

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
which will then look at both the app

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,800
directory as well as

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
applications that are connected to it

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
live

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,479
and see which ones can support the view

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
chart intent

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,840
in this case this is actually

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
my application instance on the right

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,240
here my fax check

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,520
my factset chart my right your left

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,360
um and so if i

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,720
choose this one it's going to send the

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
new context of

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,919
3m over to that chart that's now showing

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
ibm

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,520
and i can also

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,639
excuse me for example

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,280
use this other feature to find

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,120
uh intense for this context which is

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
something we saw before

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,759
um in this case i want to look at a

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,759
factset price quote for 3m

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,560
and you can see that that works

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,840
quite nicely now these are not currently

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
on the same channel so

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
because i've just directed an intent

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,319
directly at them

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
so what i can also do is i could put

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
these

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:27,599
all onto the same channel let's say i'm

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:33,599
going to put them onto the green channel

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:35,839
and now as i click through my list here

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
these factset apps are going to update

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
so i just moved to accenture

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,039
and we can see that these have all

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,760
updated with that context

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,440
and you can see how this becomes a very

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,959
powerful

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:55,760
way of of rapidly building

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:59,040
uh really robust workflows

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,560
between applications um

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,720
and so this is one of the reasons we

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,920
are super super excited about ftc 311

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,800
and what it's going to

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
do in terms of driving momentum forward

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:21,910
around

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:30,100
things like ftc3 and interoperability

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:30,100
