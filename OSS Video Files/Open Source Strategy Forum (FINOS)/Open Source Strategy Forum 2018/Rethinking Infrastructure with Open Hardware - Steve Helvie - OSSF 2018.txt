Title: Rethinking Infrastructure with Open Hardware - Steve Helvie - OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Steve Helvie, VP of Channel Development, Open Compute Project
Presentation: Rethinking Infrastructure with Open Hardware

This talk focuses on how Financial Services companies prepare for the next big technology step change while running a heterogeneous infrastructure environment (edge, fog, colo, primary data centre, etc).
 
Financial Services companies are looking for best practices gleamed from hyper-scale companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Google who run highly efficient private and public clouds. The sharing of open hardware and data centre designs is a core strategy for these companies and the basis for the Open Compute Project (OCP).
 
The Open Compute Project (OCP) was started by Facebook in 2011 with the idea of delivering the most efficient designs for scalable computing through an open source hardware community. We believe that openly sharing ideas, specifications, and other intellectual property is the key to maximizing innovation and reducing complexity in technology components. Goldman Sachs (a current board member of OCP) is one example of a company who is leveraging these designs.
 
OCP designs are more efficient at the ingredient level (server, storage, networking) compared to traditional gear yielding energy savings of 15% + and reduced service costs of ≈ 50%. Also, OCP data centres achieve PUE’s better than 1.1 (definition). In fact, IDC forecast that by 2020 OCP Servers are expected to represent 50% of the global market.
 
In this session we would discuss the key strategies Financial Services companies need to consider now to simplify the migration and data centre transformation from conventional gear to OCP and open source. We would provide specific examples of how other Financial Services companies and large enterprises have made this transition. Additional goals would include:
• Research findings – share results comparing OCP with legacy infrastructure from large enterprises who have tested OCP gear in their local facilities.
• Facebook and Microsoft – help the audience understand which OCP designs from hyper-scale companies can be used for each environment (colo, edge, etc.)

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:18,840
so um thank you everybody for making the

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:25,230
time it is 4 o'clock on the first day

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,960
and it is usually a bit fatiguing about

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,050
this particular time to pay attention

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,239
so let's how many people in here have a

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,239
phone all right great

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,450
yeah you can all right

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:49,079
anybody play this before all right go to

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:53,030
cook Kahoot I T ka age double OT dot i T

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,030
go there and you should get this screen

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,160
what's the makeup the audience here how

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,290
many developers I'm Li soccer folks

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,030
there's this side how many people get

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,310
tired of asking questions at the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:16,290
beginning of the presentation awesome

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:20,369
all right all right everybody up all

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,570
right okay I'm going to ask you ten

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,380
questions you're going to have ten

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:32,210
seconds to choose the right answer all

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,210
right just give it a second all right

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,039
there it is 71 for 2806

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,110
ten questions ten seconds each

00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:49,950
you will then be judged on your speed

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,439
and accuracy now there are prizes at the

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,030
end of this and there may be some of you

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,740
in the room that are saying well he's

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,200
just trying to buy my attention and you

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,869
would be incorrect all of you should be

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,240
saying he's trying to buy your attention

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:05,970
yeah all right here we go

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,429
ten questions I only see four people in

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:17,400
here it's probably more oh yeah there

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:31,470
are all right go number of bridges

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:36,870
across the river Thames 1725 41 or 33 33

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:38,819
only one person Wow hope that person's

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,290
from the UK all right ah

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:52,190
Valkyr who's macra all right nice next

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:52,190
one how many time zones 24 28 12 or 19

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:16,870
only one person again Wow

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:16,870
again alright next 9:15 five or ten

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,940
fourteen point nine hours a day is what

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,940
a scroll yes

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:44,900
how many breweries in the UK not enough

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:47,540
1116 5750 or two thousand uh we have

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,670
some drinkers over 2,000 according to

00:03:47,540 --> 00:04:03,410
the Internet

00:03:48,670 --> 00:04:06,100
all right boring business question what

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,100
your as Linux

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,959
for yeah everybody knows that great job

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:30,570
Rach are still in the lead how many

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,570
satellites orbiting

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:49,510
one person again 1800 some people

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:56,020
gaining how much did Microsoft pay for

00:04:49,510 --> 00:05:00,030
github seven point five six point five

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,030
five point seven or four point eight

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:08,040
seven point five we're getting close to

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,040
the end

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,680
Alibaba held a big sale last week how

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,680
much revenue do they make in one day

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,630
thirty billion last week Singles Day is

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,210
on November 11 it's the biggest online

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:36,700
shopping day in China and Alibaba

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:38,980
usually kills it yeah it doesn't amazing

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:44,650
the numbers they are staggering thirty

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:50,560
billion last week all right Wow

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:53,610
step john gaining question nine life

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,610
expectancy of a sloth

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:07,699
yeah I know 20 to 30 years Wow a lot of

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,699
people got that one right

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,759
okay the last one how many patents is

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,759
Apple have

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:33,860
seventy-five thousand that was as of the

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:38,030
end of 2017 so they said another 2500 on

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:42,310
top of that or even more alright let's

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:50,240
get the results now crow and then step

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:57,380
great so the two winners come up here

00:06:50,240 --> 00:07:00,680
all right all right you have two choices

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:04,690
now yeah you can have what I'm my gift

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,690
or what my colleague John the ban has

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,620
okay okay John

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:25,460
Starbucks gift card yeah all right yeah

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,930
thank you guys thank you everybody

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:33,050
playing all right

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:34,370
I hope I've kept you mentally engaged at

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,200
least for the first ten minutes then I

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,250
can tell my manager that everything went

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,700
well and we're good okay let's get on

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,740
with it

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,150
20 million 20 million let's talk about

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,260
that at the end of the presentation but

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,060
keep that number in mind

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:56,870
20 million all right

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,760
usually when I come to some events like

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,260
this there's always that anticipation

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,640
that I'm gonna get something out of it

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,340
there's gonna be this nugget that I'm

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,760
really going to learn and then I'm going

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,100
to have this connection or that I'm

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,320
gonna really benefit but then there's

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,760
usually this fear to that I'm missing

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,560
out on something that I didn't hear that

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,960
guy's talk or maybe I'm a little bit

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,450
behind in things so I have two simple

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,229
goals for this presentation one is to

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:27,650
let you know that open software deserves

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,630
open hardware and number two is that

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,419
there are companies that are running

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,159
open hardware underneath all of the

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,320
software that you're using today and all

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
of the apps that you're running most of

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,159
them

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,469
in the public cloud are running on Open

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,849
Compute hardware on open source hardware

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,029
and that's what we're going to talk

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,170
about today

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,600
software eating hardware I'm going to

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,009
share a little bit about the numbers and

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,410
to talk about some of the lessons that

00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,180
Open Compute has learned from the open

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,430
source community on the software side

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,209
and then lastly talk about what's

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:04,990
happening within the open data center

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:08,920
market this is a number that Gartner had

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,689
a few year and a half or so ago I think

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,209
that this vastly underestimates the

00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:15,459
amount of shift over to the right on

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:17,350
this graph most of the people that I

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,420
talk to that are interested in open

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,870
hardware when I asked them why are they

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,339
interested in this twice in the last six

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,649
months I've heard that I'm tired of

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,050
paying cisco support fees and tired of

00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,339
Cisco they didn't talk about anything

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,529
else other than the fact that they were

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,670
just tired of their current situation

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,339
I'll get into more about what's

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,709
happening now but in the banking area

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,379
and the healthcare and area it's been

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:44,879
primarily docker kubernetes and Hadoop

00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,879
that have been driving the conversation

00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:53,649
so back when VMs first started in 2008

00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:55,569
you could see that the amount of

00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,300
hardware that was needed to produce the

00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,389
same type of compute power decreased by

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,189
around 33%

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:06,759
taking that down again when we got

00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:11,860
lightweight VMs over the last few years

00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:15,220
it decreases even further on the web

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,990
server market back in 2011 11 Facebook

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,269
started something called hip hop virtual

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,209
machines because they wanted to deal

00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:24,850
with their web servers more efficiently

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,420
with their version of hip hop virtual

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,389
machine

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,480
it took web servers down to 80%

00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,910
reduction in hardware so we're seeing

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,679
software all the time eat the hardware

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,029
and commoditize it and make it almost

00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:42,069
irrelevant which is a good thing so if

00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,709
hardware is going away how's the server

00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:50,880
market doing these are numbers as of the

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:52,870
end of q2 2018 very very strong

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,000
over on the right hand side I've

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,530
highlighted the rise of the odm and I've

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,820
highlighted a couple numbers one of us a

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:03,370
hundred and twelve percent in the other

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,990
ones 60-some percent OD m for those of

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,210
you that don't know original design

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,060
manufacturer these are the manufacturers

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,710
that are manufacturing all the servers

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,540
that come to market then in the middle

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,780
you have the OEM and that might be like

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,420
a Dell or an HP or Nokia where they take

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,160
that original manufacturer they wrap

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,000
their software and services around it

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,010
and they package it om model what's

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,440
happening in the past is the large guys

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,180
always go straight to the manufacturer

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,710
they have the buying power they have the

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,600
engineering horsepower to say we're

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,880
gonna go manufacture our own we'll go

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,770
over to the guys in Taiwan we'll sit

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,060
down with them we'll we'll sketch out

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,230
exactly what we need now what's

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,360
happening is they realize that that

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,130
model works quite well in the Open

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,480
Compute model you guys can do the same

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,390
thing where you go directly to the

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,950
manufacturer there are some

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,090
disadvantages to that which I'll get

00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,710
into it a little bit but that's

00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,570
essentially the model you have

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,750
manufacturer director manufacturer that

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,800
business is growing quite substantially

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,120
how does it translate into the actual

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,220
shipments though so revenue was one

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,370
thing but you know am I getting the same

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,130
price per server and you are when you

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:18,190
look at these numbers here Dell still

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,500
leading in units but this ODM model here

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,560
this director ODM is surpassing on the

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,730
28 chip 2018 shipment but that's off of

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,620
a cou glob

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,410
that's probably 4 or 5 OD M's in that

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,660
one that I wanted to highlight is inspir

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,730
so that name may not ring a bell to you

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,490
but inspir is the third largest server

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,090
maker in the world and they supply most

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,460
of China so China is dominated by three

00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:46,000
players in the server market inspir

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:49,990
Huawei and invent Eck inven Tech and an

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,090
Inspiron most of that market and that's

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,180
what you're seeing in the tech now has

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,160
built a new office in California it's

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,770
going to have 200 plus people they now

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,420
have an office in Dusseldorf they're

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,950
expanding their seem quite rapidly and

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,930
their sales in the US have grown

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,230
several hundred percent however again

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,870
it's off a very low base so if people

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,200
are making a lot of servers who's buying

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:19,070
them this is graphed on the left hand

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,200
side the top companies the number of

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,330
companies on the right hand side you

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,580
have the companies that are buying fewer

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,410
servers so on the far left the top 10 to

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,420
20 accounts in the world are buying

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,310
close to 300 thousand servers a year

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,779
that makes sense I'm sure you may have

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,940
heard some numbers out there saying well

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,190
it's a million servers a year or maybe

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,350
this company has a million-plus servers

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,980
if they refresh every three years that's

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,570
350 thousand a year on the right hand

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,040
side though that's not where we all live

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:52,790
where we live is in that 10 5 5,000

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,770
2,500 year on up to say 15 or 20 it's

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,390
public knowledge that booking.com gave a

00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,970
presentation not too long ago they have

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,570
around 30,000 in their estate to give

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,160
you a relative example Yahoo has a

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,800
little over a hundred thousand in their

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,410
estate so they're refreshing probably

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:15,260
about a twenty five thousand a year so

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,720
on the bottom it's been long thought

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,700
that if I have if I buy a lot of servers

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,250
I have a big team and I can go do my own

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,380
things and that is the case Facebook

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,910
Microsoft Google they have big

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,890
engineering teams that can go design

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,779
their own things on the right-hand side

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,089
if I don't have a big engineering team I

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,620
need to stick with OEM gear I need to

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,750
stick with tried-and-true software and

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,700
that is not the case anymore

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,620
it may have been in the past but the

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,750
companies that we're seeing want to test

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,029
Open Compute hardware and they're moving

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,890
to the folks like cumulus for the

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,170
networking side they're all small

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,779
enterprises and small by the true

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,560
definition of small not just the lower

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,560
enterprises

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,839
all right so where are people spending

00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:05,350
their money this is a percentage of

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,269
revenue that goes toward IT this is

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,069
probably not too much of a surprise on

00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,290
the financial services where most of

00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:13,809
their money they are the highest on this

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,790
it's seven percent the guys that we just

00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,920
talked about on the tech side they're

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,509
really in that between say two and a

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:27,129
half to five percent of their revenue

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,959
the telco ecommerce tech guys they're

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,240
the sweet spot of what we're seeing on

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:36,699
the open compute side there are some

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:39,370
inefficiencies that are displayed here

00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:41,379
about the percentage of that spend and

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,350
where it goes as you can see the

00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,209
majority of it almost 60% goes to

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,829
business operations that's status quo

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,430
that's maintaining legacy gear and

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:54,639
that's basically being a duck taper if I

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:58,899
need something I fix I use duct tape to

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,029
fix it where I want to focus is on the

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,999
top 16 percent this number is very very

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,129
low it should be much higher and in the

00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:09,009
companies that we're talking to they are

00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:10,839
investing more maybe not 30 or 40

00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,629
percent maybe they're on that 20 percent

00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:17,649
range but this is where I'm gonna spend

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:21,569
most of my time so how does this move

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:23,620
into open source in the hardware side

00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,629
there are a couple ways that people

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,449
usually get products to market on the

00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:30,370
hardware one is I have a standards

00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:32,170
organization this might be I Triple E

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,360
which does all the optics stuff for

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,800
networking switches so they all get

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,199
together the manufacturers and they

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,089
write a spec maybe two or three years

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:44,079
later you get one or two adopters or

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,120
adoptions at will on the right hand side

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,069
you have multi-sourcing party agreements

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,720
this is where all these consumers get

00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,220
together maybe all the five or six

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,480
telcos in a region and they say yeah

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,360
this is great we're gonna get together

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,889
we're going to pool our buying power and

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,540
then they get together with a couple

00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,929
manufacturers and they say this is what

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:05,740
we need again driven again either on one

00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:07,589
end of the spectrum an open source you

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,839
have consumers working with

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,929
manufacturers and Open Compute for

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,990
example in on one of

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,269
projects you'll have Nokia sitting next

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,069
to gether next with a rack manufacturer

00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,490
with a switch manufacturer with a

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,480
hardware management company like Tencent

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,759
working on their hardware and management

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,369
tools all putting together and putting

00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,409
out together a product and with an Open

00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,659
Compute you have to have a product ready

00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,970
within a hundred days of getting a

00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:37,639
specification approved so when something

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,230
comes through our organization it has to

00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,029
have a product and the supply chain

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,529
ready to go behind it and that's the big

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,929
difference between that and the

00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,039
standards body a standards body it could

00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:50,629
be two or three years before you

00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:52,909
actually see a product on market all of

00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:55,580
this creates a little bit of havoc on

00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:57,740
the OEM model where OMS typically gate

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,779
keep features in order to serve a

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,519
broader market so maybe some features

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,289
don't quite get through because they

00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,669
want to scale that back so that it can

00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:09,440
reach a broader market if I'm in company

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,799
and I want to buy directly from the

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,289
manufacturer the issue with the OEM

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,710
model is I have one person I can call

00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:20,629
they come fix my server they help with

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,730
the management tools and they can do

00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:24,950
everything I need the disadvantage with

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,830
this model is now I go talk to my switch

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,509
manufacturer who now I need to talk to a

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,299
software guy that runs the software on

00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:34,580
top of that switch and I need to talk to

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,929
the guys that make the the servers and

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,860
the racks and maybe the power shelf

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,559
maybe I have one guy that does

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:43,580
everything but most of the time I have

00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:46,669
contracts with multiple parties that may

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,399
be a bad thing however in this model

00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,840
with the open source community you can

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:54,369
eliminate a lot of those inefficiencies

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,720
when you have these type of discussions

00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:00,919
so taking how the open source worked

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,480
with all of these different supply

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,820
channels and moving it to the Open

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,519
Compute foundation this is an article on

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,110
a headline from 2010 when open when

00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,149
Facebook first started the Open Compute

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,710
Project they announced that they're

00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:15,080
going to build their own data centers

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,299
and that's simply due to their scale at

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,490
that time they weren't very big and they

00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:22,039
grew quite rapidly so they were at the

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,049
time dealing with a primary OEM buying a

00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,779
lot of gear buying a lot of hardware but

00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:27,159
then they decided no

00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,080
are they going to design their own

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,840
hardware but they're going to

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,519
open-source it which was very unusual at

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,429
the time because people like the other

00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,710
hyper scalars like to keep everything

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:40,539
prior private thinking that the secret

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,159
sauce is in the hardware when it's not

00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:46,059
it's in the software and your ability to

00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,960
deliver services they started asking

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,859
themselves

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,019
forget about what they're actually

00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:52,359
asking I want you to highlight on focus

00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:54,580
on the green it started asking you know

00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,369
what can we get rid of can we do this

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,229
can we do this can we do that can we

00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:02,409
make the inlet temperature on us on a

00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:03,999
server higher can we run it hotter do we

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,309
actually need that stuff on top of the

00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:08,369
building those giant water coolers what

00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,989
if we just used free air cooling and

00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:13,419
produced a server that can run at 10

00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:14,889
degrees higher than the normal one all

00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:17,589
of this stuff led to a great deal of

00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,450
efficiencies and if you've ever read any

00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:22,059
of the initial headlines coming out

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,529
around 2010 or 2011 when they first

00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:26,169
started building their own data centers

00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:27,999
first started doing this model they come

00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,679
up with some astronomical savings just

00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,710
saying well I'm saving a billion dollars

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,119
on RIT that may be Kate that may be the

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,799
case but the majority of it is in the

00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,149
building structure itself they started

00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,549
building in the high desert plains of

00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:41,429
America so don't let that number fool

00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:43,389
you that's a little bit over aggressive

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:46,419
but there are a lot of people that are

00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,739
getting a lot of savings out of this so

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:53,219
they turned it into a technical

00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:56,559
nonprofit in 2011 along with Goldman

00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:58,389
Microsoft and Rackspace and ecchi Andy

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,779
Beco Stein who is the co-founder of Sun

00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:05,320
and works on Arista as well so those

00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:08,799
five folks got together turned it into

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,690
the Open Compute Project and since then

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,759
we've grown now we're up over 200

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:17,979
companies as of last week we have when I

00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,389
first started a few years ago we had two

00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:22,179
companies with their headquarters in

00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:25,899
Europe just two as of last week we had

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,309
43 with headquarters based in Europe so

00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:29,739
Europe is really taking a great deal

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,139
lead it's not just these guys now it's

00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:33,700
not an American driven organization with

00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:36,879
90% of the work coming out of America

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,770
its flipped most of the traction that

00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,020
I'm seeing is in Europe and North a

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:46,390
right now South Asia Southeast Asia's a

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:47,800
bit light right now so there are four

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,250
principles that guide everything that

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,620
come through our foundation one is

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,450
efficiency it has to be efficient as you

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,370
work with one of the particular projects

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,080
they're going to ask you and they're

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,590
gonna put efficiency metrics in front of

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:07,180
you number two is scale it has to be

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:09,550
scalable impact does it improve the

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,050
previous contribution does it make

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:15,060
something better than it was before

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:17,620
and last is openness does it work

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,300
compatibility does it deal with open

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,610
software very very well does it play

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,500
well with others

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:28,300
an example of this on the efficiency

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:30,100
side is a toolless design in an open

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,650
compute server you don't need any tools

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,240
it's all green touch point so you can

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,340
have somebody walk up and say change

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,690
this and just by touching the green

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,580
touch points pulling out a drawer

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,940
flipping a hard drive etc they can

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,710
change those parts Yahoo did a study

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,730
that they can change 90 percent of their

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,650
parts within a hundred and eighty

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:53,440
seconds walking through a data center if

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,930
you walk through an open compute data

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,500
center you're gonna see a bunch of blue

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:02,160
flashing lights and not much else

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,810
the average technician to server ratio

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,760
if I have a data center is usually one

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:11,440
technician for every twenty five hundred

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,270
servers two thousand servers or so in a

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,580
facebook data center and some of these

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,980
hyper scale guys they're running one

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,030
technician for forty thousand nodes for

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,520
forty thousand servers Facebook will

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,520
take an entire data center offline just

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,050
to test and see how things are going so

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,120
there's a great deal of redundancy built

00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,410
into that software so this is not just

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,850
about hardware it's all about the

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,470
software that's running on top of it

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:43,360
that's what makes these guys so

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:45,100
efficient our projects we have ten core

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,990
projects the top four they're on the

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,550
Left networking servers storage rack and

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,250
power and then the bottom ones

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,860
complement that around datacenter telco

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,890
network

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,750
open systems firmware HPC and security

00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,850
I've highlighted a couple of these other

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,429
sub projects one is advanced cooling

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,059
I'll get to in a minute modular data

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:03,799
centers

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,990
these are container data centers that

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,299
can be dropped anywhere and built on

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,850
like Legos and the other one is the edge

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,289
sub project if you've heard heard any of

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,539
the marketing coming out lately it's all

00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:16,399
about edge everybody's getting ready for

00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:18,320
the edge I talked to one particular

00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:19,640
vendor they moved 90% of their marketing

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,200
budget they stopped whatever they're

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,899
doing and everything had to have edge in

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,039
it not that they had a product they were

00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:42,740
just going to start talking about the

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:44,899
edge all right yeah by the way John

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,940
levan who is my colleague based here in

00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:49,340
London as well I'm based in London and

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,799
he's been with us a couple years now so

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,799
he's quite skilled on the facility side

00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,260
all right open systems firmware security

00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,850
and advanced cooling this is an article

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,080
from open source comm which I found

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,440
pretty interesting it talked about the

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,760
top Trent tends for 2018 I'm a sucker

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,029
for any of these top ten lists

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,649
especially when we're on it but it

00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:16,700
talked the entire article was around how

00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:19,700
open hardware is more secure than

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,529
traditional hardware when it comes to

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,019
security the idea that I'm gonna have

00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:26,720
more eyes look on it the same the same

00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:29,659
talking points that make open soft open

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,070
source software more secure was related

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,419
into this hardware especially with some

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,169
of the stuff that's recently come out

00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:38,720
around the Apple and the other computer

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:42,169
manufacturer around them having some

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,620
chip issues so this came out as a top

00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:48,830
top trend however it's actually taking

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,649
place within open compute this is a sub

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,929
project around security and the way that

00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:56,870
this came about is that we were at a

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,789
community meeting in one of the other

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,120
particular projects and it turned out

00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:03,139
that face or that Microsoft and Google

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,610
were talking about the exact same

00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:07,440
problem and they were talking

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,060
the root of trust when it comes to

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,980
hardware so when it leaves the

00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,510
manufacturing facility as it passes

00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,130
through maybe a couple different service

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,260
providers a couple different shipping

00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,120
providers and it gets to my data center

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,400
that I may or may not own that goes

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,040
through another service provider etc who

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,530
owns that route of trust and so they

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,880
were all starting to work on this

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,310
Microsoft's project is called Cerebus

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,860
and it's being rolled under here but

00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:34,890
this gives you an idea of how we're

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:38,130
addressing root of trust at the hardware

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:43,770
level and that even cludes the firmware

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:46,620
side too so Linux boot and open systems

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,450
firmware within our side are closely

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,600
linked so the same guy that started

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:54,180
Linux boot along with Google and Paris

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,830
the gentleman out of Paris is working

00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,020
very closely with our team as well and

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:03,000
this deals with open sourcing all of the

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,890
firmware that goes around the advanced

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,320
cooling I bring this up not because it's

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,860
talking more about facility side but

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,810
just the amount of conversations that

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,340
I've had around companies asking around

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:19,110
liquid cooling there are no less than

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,490
three companies in Europe in the last

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,650
four months that have joined Open

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,390
Compute who have liquid cooling

00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,300
solutions that actually have pcs running

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,980
in large companies right now so in the

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,410
past I know liquid cooling has kind of

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,600
had this stop-start niche play but it is

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,870
I think pretty much here to stay as we

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,920
see Alibaba getting ready to contribute

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,350
all of the work that they're doing

00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,850
around liquid cooling and some of the

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,360
folks that are leading the projects

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,920
based here in Europe a company out of

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,980
the Netherlands and a company out of

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,310
Spain startups are very very aggressive

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,410
in this area and it has a lot to do with

00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,720
the HPC area and the gentleman that

00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,310
spoke a couple sessions ago around the

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,590
the number of algorithms that he needs

00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:06,570
to handle and some of those workloads

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:09,300
are pretty aggressive leadership team

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,580
don't focus so much on the the logos

00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,170
it's really about the individuals our

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,850
guys run a two-year term so they're

00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,350
elected by the community if you're a

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,810
member of Open Compute you get a vote

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,149
and you can run you can run for these

00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:26,769
prod

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:27,879
terms what kind of companies these some

00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,279
of these logos are gonna be pretty

00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:31,749
familiar there's a couple here that I

00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,070
want to do that I certainly want to

00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:34,719
point out as I'd mentioned Goldman's

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,969
part of our board fidelity's on here as

00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:38,440
well there's a company here that's got

00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:41,399
the small black logo it's called edge

00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,809
core networks anybody ever heard of them

00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:44,349
they're part of the act on group anybody

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,279
heard of them

00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:50,589
no fair all right one of the absolute

00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,749
largest switch manufacturers in the

00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:53,679
world and they make a lot of switches

00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:55,629
for the guys that you're probably

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,989
already buying but they also do an

00:28:55,629 --> 00:29:02,289
enormous amount direct their business in

00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:05,499
certain areas pretty staggering so they

00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:07,089
do a lot of work with Pete from cumulus

00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:11,159
who will introduce here in a little bit

00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:14,649
but have they've contributed well over

00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:18,879
50 types of 50 SKUs on the networking

00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:22,359
side for us color chip company based out

00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:24,249
of Israel doing optics so just last week

00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:26,440
I believe Apple bought finis orb which

00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:29,859
is an optics company you'll see more and

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,809
more consolidation and aggressive area

00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:33,789
in the optics side because the optics

00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:40,989
piece is a very very high percentage of

00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:42,460
the entire networking cost the only

00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,200
other thing I would mention is the

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,739
amount of traction that we've seen from

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,690
Asia

00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:53,080
Alibaba Huawei Inman tech JD comm Lenovo

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:55,809
and Tencent two years ago we had almost

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,809
nobody from Asia so the question is well

00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:00,190
why are they joining Open Compute well

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,409
the amount of effort and energy and

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,489
resources that they're spending outside

00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:07,570
of China to break into new markets

00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:10,690
everything in China they're gonna use

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:13,599
their own form they have an oath they

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,700
have an OCP like organization called the

00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:19,450
OD CC and that's where Baidu Alibaba

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:21,279
$0.10 the China government Unicom and

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,169
mobile all got together and kind of made

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,960
their own little OCP thing where they're

00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,759
they're sharing SKUs etc everything

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,109
outside of that everything outside of

00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,559
China they're looking at Open Compute

00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:34,120
types of efforts around with Google

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,639
Microsoft Facebook and everybody in the

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,149
community to contribute so we're seeing

00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:47,919
a lot of effort from China and I expect

00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:49,299
that to grow even more all right I'm

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,509
gonna spend too much time here on the on

00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:54,549
the ways to contribute just to - I'm

00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:56,649
gonna hone in just on a couple one is

00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:58,299
the specification aspect may be written

00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:00,840
by a manufacturer or may be written by

00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:03,490
an end customer AT&T can write a spec

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,440
edge core as I mentioned or one of the

00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,389
server manufacturers or Facebook or they

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,279
could co-author a spec and it goes

00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:10,480
through one of those projects gets voted

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,429
on by our leadership committee after

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,730
review and then it gets posted for the

00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:18,039
world to see the second thing is a

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,369
product all of our products that you see

00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:23,259
on our website go back to a spec so the

00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:25,149
idea behind Open Compute is I have one

00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:28,059
spec and I can go have multiple

00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:30,009
manufacturers that's the idea behind

00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:32,129
what Facebook and Microsoft and all the

00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:35,169
guys like to do they like to leverage

00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:36,940
their supply chain they don't have half

00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:38,919
of theirs the state sitting in Dell the

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,590
other half and HP the other half and IBM

00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:48,249
etc and all the different parts one spec

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:50,230
multiple suppliers a couple of examples

00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:52,059
of what comes out of this as I mentioned

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,190
before this is an example edge core

00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,710
delivering the first 400 gig networking

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,220
device into the market through open

00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:03,100
compute and Microsoft offering some new

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,960
cloud SSD storage and our storage

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,600
program has been our project has been

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,830
very very active in the last two or

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,169
three months with a lot of companies

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:15,999
working on new api's for storage hard

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:18,669
drives in the cloud how this translates

00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:20,860
into actual customers using this so

00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:22,269
Europe as I mentioned before doing a lot

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,879
on the leadership side they're also

00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:29,169
doing a lot on the adoption side ing

00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:31,269
bank out of Poland deployed this in

00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:33,879
their public cloud running Citrix

00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:37,690
they're finding a 35% reduction in TCO

00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:41,710
and 30% reduction in up X and it's not a

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,090
very big private cloud but they're

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,250
getting the same benefits out of a few

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,100
racks as people that buy several hundred

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,320
a month

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,570
the London internet exchange this is an

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,179
example of a company that's adopting a

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,519
component of Open Compute so they don't

00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:59,500
have racks and racks of servers of Open

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,419
Compute they're focusing primarily on

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,460
open networking this is where they've

00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:06,600
spent most of their time on driving open

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:09,779
networking across the internet exchange

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,769
booking com

00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,600
they've been researching now for a

00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:16,269
couple years on Open Compute and they're

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,070
well down the road now on the POC phase

00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:20,019
and they're seeing a 40% reduction in

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,259
energy consumption compared to blade

00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:26,879
service so why why do people look at

00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:30,009
Open Compute usually its efficiency

00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:31,629
primarily its workload they think they

00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:33,850
can do their workloads better faster on

00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:36,190
Open Compute and I can save money doing

00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,809
it not necessarily just on buying the

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,789
server because that has a lot to do with

00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:41,320
your your agreements and your buying

00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,179
power with that particular organization

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,309
so I'm not saying that if you go buy

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,259
Open Compute Hardware it's gonna be 25%

00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,759
cheaper right off of that you're not

00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:52,960
going to get facebook pricing unless you

00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,279
are Facebook pricing but in general you

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,730
get a lot of efficiencies on the back

00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:01,000
end around op X and the actual server

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:03,789
behavior the last one is inter I'd see

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,279
in RIT as a service provider based out

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,990
of Milan few data centers and they're

00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,940
running part of their public cloud on

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,669
open compute and they started back in

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,710
2011 with their open source strategy and

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:18,129
they're just now doing the hardware side

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:20,200
if there is one consistent theme all of

00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:22,210
these companies heavy into open source

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,659
if you're an open source minded company

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:27,040
open source deserves open hardware

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:31,990
underneath it and it makes sense it's

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:36,270
easier a company that's not part of Open

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:38,980
Compute not doing Open Compute uber I

00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,450
get this a lot saying well we're gonna

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,659
push all of our stuff to public cloud we

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:46,270
have this edict to work on Amazon and as

00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:48,159
your and it makes a lot of sense in a

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,929
lot of ways if you take a look at all of

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,550
your app applications across the estate

00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,940
some of them makes sense to go to public

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,129
some you need private Dean Nelson who

00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,869
heads up over compute he has a three

00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,650
prong approach he's going to put a third

00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,269
of his estate

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,950
and one of the public clouds is going to

00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:04,960
use a third of it in another one and he

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,380
wants his other third his private cloud

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,630
to behave just like his public so he

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,670
wants the environment the facilities the

00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,829
the architecture the way the racks are

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,779
lined up everything to run the software

00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:22,240
just like he's doing in his public cloud

00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:24,160
and that goes back to the fact that the

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,980
public clouds he's using our running

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,450
open compute underneath so it makes

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:34,480
sense to run your private cloud in a

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:36,359
similar way quickly the marketplace a

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,769
few of folks mentioned this in the past

00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,999
sessions here we have a marketplace as

00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,980
well you can go on there and you can

00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:44,589
actually see products you can drill down

00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,150
by civil ushion provider you can

00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:49,990
actually look at the specs the devices

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:54,930
etc product specs details and we have

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:58,450
worldwide fulfillment there is always

00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:00,339
one of the unsung benefits or byproducts

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,480
of open compute and that is the energy

00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:06,130
side and the green side and I'm going to

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,109
call on John because John does a much

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,210
better job of explaining some of the

00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:11,980
stuff that's happening in the EU around

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,710
this eco design directive John do you

00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,249
mind sharing what they what they ended

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,249
up doing here

00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:41,800
okay right just a quick one who's

00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,290
familiar with the the new legislation

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,340
coming through about energy efficiency

00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:50,410
on servers in Europe no nobody

00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,570
now this legislation should have

00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:55,450
happened it should have come into play

00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:58,750
next year January next year but there's

00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:00,790
been such a big issue the the energy

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,820
efficiency targets that have been laid

00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:06,310
down was so difficult for the existing

00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,280
kind of big brand manufacturers though

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:11,140
it's been delayed now by a year now one

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:17,620
area where there's been lots of

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:23,890
screaming going on as being in terms of

00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:26,590
what we call idle power now you'd be

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:29,980
surprised how much time servers spend in

00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:32,260
an idle mode and what's interesting

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:36,310
OCP servers because of their way they're

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:38,310
designed use 50 percent less energy when

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,920
there are idle compared to a traditional

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,120
solution and it's really quite subtle

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,190
now most of the people in this room have

00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,800
probably never ever seen an OTP server

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:51,010
I'm guessing most people have never seen

00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,870
it yeah I'm alright and it's just that

00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,600
OCP server has a different physical

00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:58,150
shape it's not like a squashed pancake

00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,530
like a pizza box it has a totally

00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,530
different shape and it uses a different

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,020
fan technology and consequently this fan

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,840
technology reduces the amount of fan

00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:11,170
energy to push the air through by 9:00

00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,880
temps so it's really quite interesting

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,850
it doesn't use a standard 19 inch

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,200
practice the cabinet looks the same but

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:20,260
the way the server's go in there are

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,620
totally different shape so it makes them

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,320
very very energy efficient so this is

00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,090
something really special now we love

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,280
this because you're going to start to

00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,840
see end of life on the traditional

00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,700
server manufacturers driven by this

00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,670
legislation when it comes in so just

00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,670
watch this space okay but it's really

00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:43,080
interesting now this all kind of comes

00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,080
into a cost factor

00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:50,119
let me just take you onto something this

00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,309
this here is shall our round to the

00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,910
empty yeah yeah what this is about is

00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:58,790
this idea of combined heat and compute

00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:01,069
now what we start to see like Facebook

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,799
rebuilding a huge data center in Denmark

00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:06,140
and all of the heats going to be used in

00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:10,520
the city of a dense it's going to warm

00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:13,190
up 7,000 8,000 flats now this is why

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,740
it's really interesting in terms of this

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:20,030
liquid cooling that Steve mentioned we

00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:22,040
had a research done by IHS market

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,780
recently and what they found from all

00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,780
the interviews they did around Europe

00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,900
that 22 percent of everybody they

00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:32,599
interviewed was going to use heat reuse

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,410
from data centers and they were also

00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:38,150
going to implement liquid cooling

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,460
because if there's anyone in this room

00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:43,069
you might not quite get it but when you

00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,470
move to liquid cooling it makes it

00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:47,089
extremely efficient to put the heat into

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,380
a district heating system because you

00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:51,200
don't need what's called an intermediate

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,359
heat pump it's extremely efficient so

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,730
this is a real big drive in the next two

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,990
years you're gonna see a 22 percent of

00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,480
everybody interviewed are going to be

00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,670
doing this and this comes back to that

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,099
modular data center as well so I think

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,690
it's going to have a huge impact on the

00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:11,839
market and in terms of energy efficiency

00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:14,299
it's quite profound now there's another

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,220
thing that the this all happens this is

00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:20,359
the craziness of open source communities

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:22,339
we now have a complete reuse mechanism

00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,480
in place hundreds of thousands of

00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:25,579
servers that coming out the hyper

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,760
scalars and now being totally reused

00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:32,030
into the enterprise space it's a huge

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,119
business you can now build an OTP data

00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,319
center with second user gear in at the

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,839
same price that you would have

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,400
historically built a traditional what we

00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:45,920
call tear free enterprise the plate

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:49,210
center with nothing in it it's

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,490
profoundly different in terms of price

00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:57,859
and it has a green element what's your

00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:58,970
story on this one Steve mayor I've kind

00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:01,309
of jumped in here a bit because some of

00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:05,029
these are my slides now the Linux

00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:07,700
Foundation started into 2000 is its

00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,960
dominant today now what's interesting a

00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,640
lot of people don't know this if I

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:17,750
counted these servers coming out of

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:21,020
manufacturing today yeah this is

00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:23,240
open-source Hardware within the next two

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,190
years if you count in the servers coming

00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:31,279
out of factories 50% of them will be

00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,750
open source and a lot of people just

00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:34,490
can't get ahead around it because the

00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:39,400
amount of servers are going to the hyper

00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:42,859
scalars are huge Steve mentioned like

00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,740
300,000 refresh on a single harvest gala

00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:47,750
I can tell you this now it's multiple

00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:51,829
times that for the big hyper scales it's

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:54,109
millions per year it's such a huge gap

00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:55,880
and what's happening all this technology

00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:58,339
is just rolling out it's going into the

00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,170
telco space all the world's telecoms

00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:05,710
companies are now adopting this

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,710
technology it's really exciting

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,880
if you want to see this stuff you can

00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,450
see it around Europe we've got places

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,280
you can go to Amsterdam

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:20,640
this place is 20 kilometers just outside

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,980
of London it's specially designed data

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,590
centre now what's interesting about an

00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:28,140
OCP optimized data center in terms of

00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,790
just building the facility here's an

00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,980
interesting one if you build an

00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,640
enterprise data center what's called a

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,370
tear-free

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,990
data center and luckily I've got someone

00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,130
in the room who are know understands me

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,350
because we had a conversation earlier

00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,780
you can spend just to build a facility

00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:45,360
not spot the IT gear in just to build a

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:48,330
facility but will the call in the power

00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,420
and stuff in it can be up to ten million

00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:54,390
dollars per megawatt now just to put

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,980
that into perspective that's like a data

00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:59,640
center that holds about a hundred to one

00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,470
hundred and forty four racks now if you

00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,590
build an OCP optimize data center

00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,790
facility it's half that price you don't

00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,140
have access floors you don't have

00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:11,370
centralized UPS you don't have

00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,990
mechanical chilling all these costs

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,490
really kind of bundle in this is why the

00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:19,890
hyper scale is doing its just so

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:21,960
cost-effective so elsewhere you've got

00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,320
Rises an interesting one this one on the

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,510
end

00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:28,200
this one here Rises a Research Institute

00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:30,570
in Sweden and never never got one and a

00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,100
half thousand OCP servers which they do

00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,660
an experimental work on they're just

00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,050
built a brand new datacenter to house

00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,550
them so you'll start to see Nokia by the

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,130
way is huge go and have a look at

00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,300
Nokia's airframe solution

00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:46,650
Nokia's airframe solution is all based

00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:52,080
on OCP so low sleepy get open sore

00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:54,030
target now we're trying to get these

00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,360
experience centers because many people

00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,980
have never ever seen this gear so we're

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,990
building this is one that we opened

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,160
three weeks ago in Amsterdam yeah and

00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,410
just to show you the kind of energy

00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,490
Eric's moving when I first started two

00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,410
years ago I used to go and do a

00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:12,630
presentation to 200 people and I'd say

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:16,620
who's heard of OCP or open computer

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:19,650
hardware in a room with 200 people four

00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:23,670
people might put their hand up we did a

00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:27,720
summit last last month and I think we

00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:31,400
must have about 750 people there just in

00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:35,540
two two years sorry

00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:40,230
now what this is this 20 million is the

00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,610
electricity saving on one bank everybody

00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,340
would know this bank I'm not gonna say

00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:46,350
they are I'll have a quiet word with you

00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,840
afterwards this is a single bank and

00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,130
it's the energy saving in electricity

00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:54,870
saving if they just changed their

00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:58,200
physical hardware to OCP get 20 million

00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,790
a year and on that I'll leave it but

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,590
it's a very cost-effective and it's

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:06,360
quite radical what I think we do thanks

00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:08,520
for your time tomorrow as I focused a

00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:14,700
lot on the networking side if you're

00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:18,390
here this is a gentleman from cumulus

00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:20,430
networks work with us on the networking

00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,050
side and he's going to do a deep dive on

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,430
open networking and how it works you

00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:27,630
wanted to give a summary real quick are

00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,440
two minutes on or 20 seconds all right

00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,050
awesome

00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,840
so I highly encourage this I know it's

00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,760
tomorrow at 3:10 p.m. these guys are

00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,000
great and they do a ton with open source

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,940
so all right that's it thanks so much

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,499
[Applause]
