Presentation: Open sourcing a bank's software: exactly what is competitive advantage?

Banks have been users of open source software for a long time, but now they are thinking seriously about giving back. A lot of internal resistance needs to be overcome, and lots of individuals within a large investment bank truly believe their piece of custom built software provides a competitive advantage. At Adaptive, we have seen a lot of very similar internal projects at various institutions, and have formed a view about what truly constitutes competitive advantage. What is good for the organisation may not be good for a given development manager.
 
Further to the issues around over jealously guarding specific development efforts is the problem that what is open sourced is often far too coupled to a bank’s non-open sourced tech stack. Causing more subtle difficulties in working with another bank’s open sourced technology stack is that it is often implicitly coupled to their culture, processes or business model. Picking what to open source is a huge part of the challenge.
 
In this talk, I will give Adaptive’s view on what is competitive advantage, what to open source so that it is picked up by the wider community, and actual benefits are seen.
