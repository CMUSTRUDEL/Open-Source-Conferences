Title: Open sourcing a bank's software: exactly what is competitive advantage? - Matt Barrett - OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Matt Barrett, CEO and co-founder, Adaptive
Presentation: Open sourcing a bank's software: exactly what is competitive advantage?

Banks have been users of open source software for a long time, but now they are thinking seriously about giving back. A lot of internal resistance needs to be overcome, and lots of individuals within a large investment bank truly believe their piece of custom built software provides a competitive advantage. At Adaptive, we have seen a lot of very similar internal projects at various institutions, and have formed a view about what truly constitutes competitive advantage. What is good for the organisation may not be good for a given development manager.
 
Further to the issues around over jealously guarding specific development efforts is the problem that what is open sourced is often far too coupled to a bank’s non-open sourced tech stack. Causing more subtle difficulties in working with another bank’s open sourced technology stack is that it is often implicitly coupled to their culture, processes or business model. Picking what to open source is a huge part of the challenge.
 
In this talk, I will give Adaptive’s view on what is competitive advantage, what to open source so that it is picked up by the wider community, and actual benefits are seen.

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:17,840
so let's check off I'm going to talk for

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,369
about half now I think on our

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,460
perspective on what banks should

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,750
open-source what they shouldn't what we

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,750
think is being open sourced at the

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,340
minute and without giving away the whole

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,940
point of the talk why we think it's the

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,350
wrong thing but before I get into all of

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,500
that detail

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,399
let's introduce myself a little bit and

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:46,039
adaptive and and who we are and why we

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,000
think well why I think because I'm

00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,070
possibly too confident that I have an

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,649
opinion we're sharing so adaptive is a

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,480
software consultancy we specialized in

00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,829
financial services capital and commodity

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,449
trading markets and then within that

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,800
very broad space which people in the

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,439
room would know very well it's sort of

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,360
fractal we work in front office

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,070
real-time trading so we have built many

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,530
many real-time trading platforms over

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:16,710
the years since we were founded in 2012

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:20,820
we have offices in London in the city in

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,750
Barcelona New York and Montreal we're

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,040
about 180 people 175 people globally at

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,710
the moment so we've got grown quite

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,759
quickly since myself at all my name is

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,799
Matt Barrett by the way

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,500
and since myself and three others

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,280
co-founded the company back in 2012 and

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,030
we work for a number of investment banks

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,220
tier 1 tier 2 tier threes in London New

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,460
York and also regional investment banks

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,220
we work for market service providers so

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,600
liquidity accurate aggregators exchanges

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,009
those sorts of firms building their

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,219
electronic training infrastructure this

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,899
is sort of the agenda but it's a very

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,909
small room it's just after lunch if

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,070
anyone disagrees with me wildly please

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,600
just stand up and say so and we can have

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,550
a really big a good debate about it

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,220
rather than going on and on about it I'm

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,080
going to talk a little bit about what

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,720
think a bank stack looks like and talk

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,730
and show an open-source implementation

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,250
that we have that we use as a sort of a

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,990
sales tool I'm going to talk about a

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,150
little bit what I think competitive

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,610
advantages to banks and why they would

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,390
be interested in open sourcing and then

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,890
I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,060
what we think is being open sourced at

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,260
the moment and I might be wrong my

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,370
perspective on it might be wrong and

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,840
others in the room may have a much

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,050
different perspective and it'll be

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,840
really great to hear that and then I'm

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,150
gonna touch very quickly and hopefully

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:50,450
but contentiously on why we think it's

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:53,090
wrong so we build front of us trading

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,770
applications and when we before we

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,060
started adaptive we were doing myself

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,800
and the co-founders were doing a very

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,500
similar thing and we were doing it with

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,450
very expensive vendor products if you

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:10,940
needed to build an fx single dealer

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:13,010
platform like this one which is now

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,310
completely open-source you would start

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,160
off by paying a vendor or multiple

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,620
vendors a million US dollars a year to

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,910
get going because you needed them to

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,250
solve a whole bunch of very difficult

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,989
technical problems that open-source

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,880
community didn't solve that were beyond

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,380
your wit and ability to solve internally

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,200
so you went to a vendor and you paid

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,150
them a lot of money over the years that

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,480
has changed to the point where this

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,120
thing which is as you can see an if it's

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,260
single dealer platform Bank of adaptive

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,570
analytics streaming prices are blotter

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,720
connectivity to buy a WebSocket broker

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,410
to Google Cloud all of the backend is

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,970
written in dotnet running on running and

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,980
running on Linux so written and dotnet

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,780
core running on Linux written and docker

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,150
containers deployed in Cuba Nettie's

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,280
running on a Google container service it

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,299
costs I'm not actually sure cost

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,260
anything to be honest with you I don't

00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,720
think we get above the minimum usage

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,110
requirements it's an FX SDP and it's all

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,239
open source that's pretty impressive the

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,570
problem is that as we go into different

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,850
banks and work on platforms that look

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,490
similar to this they're not using any

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,860
open source technology to do to solve

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,720
the hard problems they're building a lot

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,430
of it themselves they're still using BIM

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,600
products they're spending a lot of money

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:35,180
doing the wrong thing we think as a

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,190
consultancy that it's let me lay out my

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,450
cards it's good business going in and

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,570
doing the same thing over and over again

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:45,140
a pretty boring though we also don't

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,880
think that if people used if banks used

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,160
open-source software effectively and

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,830
we'll get into what effectively means in

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,660
the foolish to the talk we don't think

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,490
that they would spend less we think they

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,320
would go further we think if you're in

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,460
the room working at an investment bank I

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,620
don't think you should think about

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,720
open-source as necessarily a way of

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,340
reducing your software development costs

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,380
you will probably spend about the same

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,760
but you will just go further you'll get

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,620
a lot more done and you'll probably able

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,840
to differentiate yourself in the market

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,240
with that effort you're able to spend

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,380
and if you think you're good at being a

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,630
bank that's probably what you should

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:26,960
want to do so that's this so this is as

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,190
I said open source at on github come and

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,640
chat to me afterwards if you would like

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,220
that link but it's just an open source

00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,169
stack that we've written to sort of

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,700
demonstrate the architectural approaches

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,820
we use for our clients since we can't

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,169
usually yet fingers crossed

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,400
open source all of the work we do for

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,060
our clients hopefully that'll change in

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,700
a few years the architecture looks like

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,200
this and the reason I'm kind of putting

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,660
a technical architecture in front of you

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,669
is because I want to when we go through

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,490
the rest of the talk loop back and touch

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,320
a little bit on what bits of this are

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,620
actually competitive advantage to a bank

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,250
this is just one diagram of the

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,590
architecture of the reactive trader

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,590
there are dozens of other diagrams you

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,970
could draw that all show different views

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,190
on the same thing they could talk about

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,890
process they could talk about tooling

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,030
they could talk about the technical

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,380
layers of architecture and

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,850
infrastructure that sit underneath all

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,270
of this they could talk about a whole

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,340
bunch of things this is one view on

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,290
coupling and there are other views on

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,610
coupling and I think the thinking about

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,440
these things through the lens of

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,270
coupling is a really interesting way to

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,190
think about them because coupling is one

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,110
of the things that prevents reuse which

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,090
is why I think some of what's being open

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,449
store

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,449
is the wrong thing so what is

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:50,320
competitive advantage for a bank I think

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,000
about it as having three layers the

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,660
business operating model can provide

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,340
competitive advantage the way you do

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,690
things can also be a competitive

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,570
advantage if you have a very open

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,889
collaborative sharing culture maybe you

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,380
should have a business operating model

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,389
that does something with that culture to

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,280
make you more efficient and more

00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,699
competitive in the market and you can

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,990
also of course have a technical

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,080
infrastructure then it should be very

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,430
very agile if indeed agility is

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,990
important to your business operating

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:25,419
model I've been through quite a few edge

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,330
old transformations inside investment

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:31,620
banks and it's quite funny because you

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,820
have software developers and IT rapidly

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,340
evolving and trying to become very high

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,930
velocity and business sponsors and

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,300
business stakeholders and business

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,919
people who actually don't want velocity

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,930
at all they're not interested in

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,520
changing every two weeks they would very

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,560
happily change once every 12 months

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,660
these two organizations don't don't talk

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,910
about it and don't seem to come together

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,470
and meet in the middle at all so if you

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,940
have technical infrastructure that gives

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,560
you agility and a business operating

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,419
model that doesn't need agility

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,410
well you've traded something that isn't

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,389
very useful and all that where things

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,380
are coupled up and down that stack and

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,139
we're they're decoupled is a very

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,710
interesting way to think about what you

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,210
could be open sourcing so some examples

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,310
of what I mean here a business operating

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,530
model based around latency arbitrage in

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,120
that example technical infrastructure is

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,539
a pretty pretty clear competitive

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,120
differentiator you might be one of the

00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:26,979
few remaining truly Universal investment

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,630
banks aiming to provide a price and

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,000
everything to anyone anywhere in the

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,310
world that's a way that that's a

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,380
business model you could be deep into

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,560
product specialization one of our

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,560
clients at the moment does the best

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,080
Ozzie Kiwi fix rate in the world they

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,310
have lots of lots of clients in

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Australia in New Zealand

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm telling you the story because I'm

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,440
from New Zealand and they also have a

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,990
bunch of clients operating

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,450
internationally interested and try

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,870
currency because it's very popular in

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,920
the the Kiwi dollar releases in the g10

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,870
so those are different ways that our

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,890
business our banking about a banks

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,920
business operating model could

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:09,990
differentiate itself process and culture

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,760
is more difficult to identify we're

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,800
talking about open source technology so

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,920
let's stick to talking about the culture

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,950
and process around software development

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,360
development models are very you can have

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,250
very very different development models

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,020
that get you to the same place you can

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,390
have very open and collaborative

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,310
development models where the software

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,060
development teams work in an R&D like

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,880
fashion share knowledge work with each

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,140
other a very open to new ideas

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,550
emotionally vulnerable and Google has

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,110
done a lot of research into what makes

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,830
high-performing teens and it's all those

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,870
sorts of things or you can have a

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,430
development model where I was talking to

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,200
someone at last last night over dinner

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,390
we're developers walking in the morning

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,980
plug in so to speak to their computer

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,540
put their headphones on don't really

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,560
talk to the people alongside them even

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,540
though they're all solving the same

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,510
problem hopefully going in the same

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,250
direction and aren't interested and

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,070
you've got a development team made up of

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,200
individuals I personally think software

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,510
development and the delivery of complex

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
projects is a team sport and if you're

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,899
doing it differently you're probably

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,060
missing out but you have one of those

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,670
with you know it or not and you have

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,410
tools to support it and from those tools

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,560
you generate software and that software

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,579
is coupled to those tools and you also

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,660
of course have a whole bunch of

00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,970
technical infrastructure that your

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,220
developers hopefully are implementing to

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,649
avoid reuse to avoid everyone generating

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,110
the same thing ideally you probably

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,779
maybe have a cross asset blotter maybe

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,010
maybe you don't maybe there's no one in

00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,690
your organization that cares to have

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,540
such a thing but you probably have

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,310
something around messaging api s and

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,020
ability to describe service contracts

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:51,149
etc etc you most likely have workflow

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,700
engines because fundamentally trading is

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,709
a workflow and you hopefully have some

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,029
high availability patterns or else all

00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,339
of your infrastructure is running on one

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,790
box and your high vallabha high ability

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,949
high availability pattern is hope and as

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,279
I was told recently by someone hope is

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:12,089
not

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:13,259
strategy so why why do so these what why

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,399
am I talking about this the point is

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,569
that there these are three different

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,540
things that a bank has that cause

00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:24,269
coupling and when people talk about open

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,670
sourcing I think they almost universally

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:31,980
talk about open sourcing things that

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,899
have a clean API or clean boundary when

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,149
thought of as technical infrastructure

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,620
I'm pretty convinced people don't think

00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,660
about the operate the business operating

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,430
model or the process in culture when

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,740
they look at a component and think about

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,420
open sourcing it and I think that means

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,980
that what a lot of people are open

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,769
sourcing is not going to fit anywhere

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,449
else is going to be doomed to be an

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,860
expensive failure which i think is bad

00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,149
for everyone in the room who believes

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,120
this is something the industry should

00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:00,689
should get behind and so why do banks

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,059
open source very quickly I think there

00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:05,129
are soft reasons why banks open source

00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,860
and I think that there are hard economic

00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:10,589
rationale reasons that banks should be

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,819
open sourcing and I think a lot of

00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:16,680
people are doing this they are looking

00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,029
from New York from London at least

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,509
working across the Atlantic looking

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,850
across America looking to the west coast

00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:25,680
looking at Silicon Valley seeing what is

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,360
happening out there and thinking that if

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,779
we open source will end up like those

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,220
firms I don't think that is what will

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,279
happen if you open source without

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,649
understanding why unfortunately open

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
sourcing internal components even if you

00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:44,279
manage to find the right component is

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,709
very expensive and the doing it well is

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,240
time consuming it opens you up for a lot

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,970
of criticisms about everything you've

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,620
done and that's if you do it right if

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,730
you do it wrong it's even worse it's a

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,529
very unpleasant place to have the

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,920
internet to come down on you no one

00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:04,079
argues like a technologist right

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,759
the what to do it well I think what

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,740
needs to be open sourced needs to be

00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,249
reusable and this touches on the

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,679
coupling it's very very easy to spot a

00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,089
clean API developers look at it and say

00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,290
that's a very clean API that's a good

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,990
abstraction we feel like we should

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,490
abstract that component

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,980
but the problem is that if it's too

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,890
close to the business operating model

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,450
its coupled to that operating model even

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,279
if you can't see it and that's really

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,620
intangible and I don't I don't have an

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,390
answer to see it to say how you can spot

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,100
but if your technical infrastructure

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,660
that are really coupled to your business

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,270
operating model and one way to think

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,800
about it is that if it's closer to where

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,089
the trade is done and you're just

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,589
thinking about increasing volumes

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,529
because that's how you make your money

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,120
it might deserve some extra thought and

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,950
careful consideration as to whether it

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,870
is actually coupled to your operating

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,640
model if you have only worked in your

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,140
organization for the last 15 years

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,130
you should not be the person deciding

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,839
whether or not it's coupled to your

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,209
operating model because you're a fish

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,690
and you don't know that you're in water

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:04,250
which is unpleasant but true equally if

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,680
it's closer to the club if it's closer

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,410
to the culture or the process or the

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,270
methodology of how you do things you're

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,770
also going to have trouble getting any

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,209
sort of reuse out of it or other

00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,130
organizations I should say will have

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:18,740
trouble getting reuse out of it what's

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,390
an example of this lots and lots of

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:25,310
discussion around Interop at the moment

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,810
different banks have different ways of

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,050
thinking about the software they deploy

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:32,810
some of them have a very top-down

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,300
command and control mechanism for

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,700
releasing software in that world tight

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,470
coupling between components is fine

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,230
because that's how the organization

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,810
works other organizations who would

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,240
prefer to have or would like to move

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,040
towards very loose bound model of

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,630
developer cooperation and component

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,420
cooperation will take a different view

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,100
but if you just see it as tooling and

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,570
you don't understand that it's actually

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,800
very very coupled to your development

00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,089
process and the way you deliver software

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,440
you're going to be a little bit

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,839
disappointed when other people don't see

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,700
the the genius of what you release which

00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,459
is obviously a bit of an attack on the

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,329
ego not very pleasant or just before I

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:12,589
move on there's a great blog post that

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:16,940
kind of talks through all the reasons

00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:18,410
why a free operation source software

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,959
project is doomed to fail some of these

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,520
are quite funny and the source code is

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,290
more than 100 megabytes I've seen lots

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,050
of open-source banking projects that are

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,579
bigger than yeah too big to fit on a

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,770
floppy disk as they say not really the

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,720
answer anyway you could find this online

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,730
it's quite fun

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,100
and probably worth a very quick sanity

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:42,760
check before you open source your your

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:45,690
baby people open source because they

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,380
think it looks cool and they also are

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,050
interested in giving back to the

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,780
community now that's very a very good

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,480
reason to do it lots of banks are built

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,590
on a lot any all technology these days I

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,530
think has built on open source

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,850
technology in some part and if we are

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,560
trying to be good corporate citizens

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,270
much like we're trying to be around the

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,830
environment or sustainability maybe we

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,440
should also be giving back to the open

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,590
source community if we look at the top

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,660
10 contributors on github by

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,060
organization it's quite interesting

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,260
there's no finance firms here but I know

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:23,920
that very large investment banks have

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,630
developer numbers rivaling at least if

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,670
not larger than some of these technology

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,080
firms what are they generating with it

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,700
right I don't know that's topic for

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,110
another day but the point is that none

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,430
of them are contributing but it's not

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,250
because of numbers it's because of what

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,270
they're doing these firms are cool

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,110
they're probably attractive to

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,120
candidates because of it and I wonder if

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,690
because KPIs and policy is such a blunt

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,000
instrument

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:51,220
I wonder if a bank that said your bonus

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,750
is going to be decided based on the

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,190
number of contributors you get in the

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,830
organization to be checking into our

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,120
github repository what would happen it

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,100
would be a very interesting experiment

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,730
um not one that I want to take but it'll

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,730
be very interesting

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:14,789
the other to get onto sort of hard

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,769
rational hard economic rational reasons

00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,600
and one of the things I think that that

00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,159
banks are struggling with at the moment

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,169
is he believed to open-source

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,639
effectively to externalise costs I think

00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:27,089
this is something that Silicon Valley

00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:28,710
does exceptionally well what do you do

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,080
while you taken and take an internal

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,350
capability that you're continuously

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,759
investing in but you don't think is

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,769
differentiating you in the market that

00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,409
is not something that the IT manager in

00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:42,179
charge of that project is able to decide

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:43,320
everyone's pet project definitely

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,879
differentiates them in the marketplace

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,100
you're going to have to have someone

00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:48,840
very senior in the organization take

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,549
their toy away from them which will be

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,859
difficult and painful but critical for

00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:56,070
this to work you're going to need to

00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:58,169
provide stewardship to build a community

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,600
to have it become self maintaining and

00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,940
therefore reduce your investment there's

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,129
going to be a period of additional

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,109
investment required stewardship doesn't

00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:10,019
come cheaply unfortunately you're going

00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:12,299
to have to foster engagement pizza beer

00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,369
but also a lot of other more softer

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,230
things but hopefully if you get it right

00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:18,239
it will become self maintaining and over

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,220
time you can reduce your investment and

00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,379
just reap the benefits of having some

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,269
core part of your infrastructure out in

00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:26,210
the world with the community and maybe

00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:30,359
your competitors maintaining it for you

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:33,960
if we think back to that effect single D

00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,359
of a platform I think that if we sat

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,070
down and looked at all the components

00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:41,549
and thought rationally about it there

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:44,970
was a lot fear that what we're using in

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:47,789
that in that if X SDP that toy if exist

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,070
EPR some open source technologies that

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,350
to be to be frank with you or a bit

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,970
for capital markets engineering

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,820
requirements but they're all we have I

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,919
know that banks have better

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,779
infrastructure than many of those open

00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,369
source libraries they just see it as

00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,889
really competitive the problem is we see

00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,269
five six seven different tier 1 of s and

00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:08,369
banks they kind of all have the same

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,869
stuff kind of spending a lot of money

00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:11,220
that others are spending and you're not

00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:13,739
really differentiating yourself with it

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,149
it's a bit unfortunate I think that if

00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:16,499
we looked at it rationally would be able

00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:19,139
to identify some things that would be

00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:20,460
able to be open sourced which would be

00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:24,690
very exciting

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,300
a very simple toy example but is very

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,740
illustrative one of our clients shared

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,180
this with us which was which was very

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,610
kind of them they've recently open

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:37,080
sourced a major initiative based on

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:39,360
Apache aero and unbeknownst to them

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,850
Apache arrow and now keeping it updated

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,580
for them that's quite nice isn't it

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,830
at scale that becomes usually effective

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,840
doesn't come easy doesn't come cheap but

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,960
if you start to see these sorts of

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,100
benefits and rewards that's it's it's

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,680
obviously reducing your cost and

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,110
externalizing it it's not removing the

00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,660
cost you're literally making someone

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,440
else do it for you for free we're all

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,430
capitalists right that that's amazing

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,150
the other thing that you can get out of

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:16,110
this is greatly reducing your hiring or

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:17,970
training costs if you can get an

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,820
open-source component to have hugely

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,860
wide adoption that means that you can

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,890
hire people that know your text at

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,080
before they walk in the door I already

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,370
think that most technologists most maybe

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,930
I'm still overstating it a lot of

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,510
technologists inside an investment bank

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,760
don't know how Bank makes money and the

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,590
bank doesn't really care what they want

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,720
those technologists to have however is

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,280
for some reason financial services

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,570
experience they don't really need

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,680
financial services of experience because

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,750
they don't know how the bank makes money

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,430
what they need is technology experience

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,700
in the right technology if we could

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,080
decouple those things you'd find that

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,140
Investment Banking had a much bigger

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,310
hiring pool to employ people from a much

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,620
bigger hiring pool would probably reduce

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,080
costs I'm a software developer is this

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,030
really what I'm aiming for but you know

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,970
it's it's a benefit to the industry

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,470
overall I think and I also think that if

00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,390
you are hiring people that understand

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,400
the tech stack your time to productivity

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,080
will be much much lower you will get

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,120
return on bringing new people into the

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,410
organization far faster and one of the

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,570
things that is incredibly effective in

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,830
generally approved improving the overall

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,330
quality of the ecosystem

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,800
there's people moving from different

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,200
organizations and cross pollinating

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,060
ideas there's a lot of resistance and

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,590
certain firms that we know of to bring

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,970
new people into core teams because

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,990
they'll take a year and a half to get up

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,280
to speed

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,740
it's a year and a half because it's so

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,410
arcane if you could somehow reduce that

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,880
level of obscurity you would get the

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,760
benefits of cross-pollination without

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,540
paying the cost of the the time

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,550
productivity and the other point is that

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,340
from a hiring perspective if you

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,990
suddenly have developers contributing

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,970
pull requests or interacting with your

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,260
open source community you've pretty much

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,300
gone through a hiring process already

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,520
which is incredibly effective well I

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,620
know that an adaptive we have people

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,440
engage with the various open source

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:10,730
contributions we make and we find those

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,510
people to be hugely motivated fantastic

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,290
consultants that what they want to come

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:19,020
and work for us and its really effective

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:21,300
oh yes this is and the other the other

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,950
point I think would be that everyone

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,429
knows banks are competing with Silicon

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:30,440
Valley for talent out of universities

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:32,670
those graduates are going because it's a

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,750
comparatively well-paid often better

00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:37,290
paid if you're doing AI and machine

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,750
learning but it's also what they know

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,040
it's really visible graduates look at

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,790
the world of software as they came out

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,160
of university and see Netflix Google

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:48,780
Facebook etc they see their projects and

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,670
they gravitate to working either on

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,110
those projects or working for those

00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,910
companies banks just don't have a

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,550
visibility or prisons are real shame I

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,740
firmly believe that Capital Markets

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,559
engineering problems are really really

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,020
interesting and also still relatively

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,170
unsolved but unfortunately students want

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,750
to go and do do other things we opened

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:12,450
an office in Barcelona a couple of years

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,100
ago and it isn't a market with a lot of

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:18,440
financial services or capital markets

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:21,540
history and we compete with you know

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,010
online pet stores just for talent which

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,300
i think is a real shame that they sort

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,640
of see investment banking and financial

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,320
services as as boring engineering I

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,990
think an online pet store is pretty

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,340
boring but there you go so the other

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,630
thing you can do with open source of you

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,100
if you are doing it very well and

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,720
thinking very strategically about it is

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,720
that you can change the way the market

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,080
operates overall there's a fantastic

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,860
series of blog posts talks up from from

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,470
a bit of a character

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,270
a guy called Simon Wardley who I would

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,559
encourage you all to go away and follow

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,350
and read and understand a little bit

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,540
more about technology strategy it's very

00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,570
very interesting stuff he talks about

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,780
the evolution of capability in the form

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,970
of software from being custom-built to

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,410
becoming utility or a commodity and

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,500
sitting in the middle of that that

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:13,500
evolution is product most of what banks

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,290
do is custom-built but if they could

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,670
force it through product ie not suddenly

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,190
get trapped and having to pay a vendor

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,350
for all this really expensive pay a

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,390
vendor a lot of money for a capability

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,860
and move it straight to utility they

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,049
would free up a huge amount of economic

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,790
capacity to do very innovative

00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,809
differentiating things on top of that I

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,669
think that's that's really interesting

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:36,990
and that goes back to the point I was

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:38,820
making about all the web push real-time

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,590
messaging that we see banks putting into

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,419
the effect single doodle platforms if

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,010
there was just a standard way to do it

00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,000
maybe if it's single do platforms

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,860
wouldn't all look the same

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,860
would that be wouldn't it be refreshing

00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,940
so what do we see as being open source

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,710
probably doesn't surprise you I've kind

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,350
of told you this all the way through we

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,559
think that what's getting open source at

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,760
the moment is is frequently coupled to

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,770
internal technical infrastructure

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,080
although that's the least worst of all

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,450
the problems we think that things are

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,070
very very coupled to a banks cultural or

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,169
procedural environment and I think the

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,610
big challenge there as I mentioned is

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:16,679
that the PIP is that the individuals

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,260
doing the pushing for the contribution

00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,220
are like fish they don't understand that

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,480
the process that they're following isn't

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,860
universal that there are other banks who

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,270
do things differently that means the

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,830
tooling they've bought the work that

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,780
they've built I should say the workflow

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,010
they go through even from the way they

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,809
talk to the business engineer

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,280
requirements develop and deliver

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,350
software because all of that is

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,730
fundamentally supported by tooling these

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,799
days it's different at other

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,510
organizations and they struggle to see

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,799
it and then the other thing that we see

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,270
things as being very coupled to and this

00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:51,030
is that this is the hardest to spot as

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:55,320
is a banks operating model hang on but

00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:57,210
doing it's not that open sourcing

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,590
doesn't generate zero value I mean

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,419
there's a cost to it so you have to make

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,610
sure that there is some benefit to it

00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,380
but

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:08,350
you do get the softer benefits from it

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,000
and I think we have to start somewhere

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,880
so I would definitely not

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm not saying stop don't do anything

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,610
I'm just saying think we definitely want

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,780
to start walking down this road all

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,890
together and I think something like the

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,600
nos is a great place to obviously

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:24,820
discuss all of that stuff what do we

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,620
think so why don't we think that's right

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,580
or I look to Silicon Valley for

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,860
inspiration possibly possibly naively

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:36,100
what we see Silicon Valley firms doing

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,830
is open sourcing either a layer of the

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,620
business process or a layer of technical

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,140
architecture sometimes they encourage a

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,090
business to be built around it and in

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,770
doing so they often add gasoline to the

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,570
adoption process by really really

00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,520
drumming up community to community

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,059
community around it like Silicon Valley

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,809
marketing firms for developers are

00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,730
exceptionally good at drumming up

00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:02,200
interest it is terrifying how you can

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:04,570
take a obscure arcane technical product

00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,750
like react when it was released from

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,250
very low visibility to one of the most

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,770
popular UI frameworks in the course of

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,600
about two and a half years anyone in

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,000
retail anyone and any other sort of

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,440
technicals in any other space would kill

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
for that sort of ability to penetrate a

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,440
market with a new idea so they are very

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,630
very good at it but Ansari and then

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,270
doing so to in generating that that

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,669
involvement their engagement they are

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,010
and effect externalizing costs Facebook

00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,419
can higher react developers very very

00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,410
cheaply now because there's hundreds and

00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,049
hundreds of thousands of them they

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,640
massively increased the supply of a core

00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:44,260
constraint on their on their business

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,730
model but what's interesting about I

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,200
think and there's something wrong with

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,110
the slide let me if anyone figures that

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,580
out stick your hand up and tell me these

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,700
are some open source projects that have

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,950
come from different famous organizations

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,559
what's interesting about them is that

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,809
none of them have anything to do with

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,320
the business they're just a layer of the

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,940
technical architecture in fact most of

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,860
those are wrong I've switched them

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,950
around that's what they've actually

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,929
released and unless you really knew the

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,119
open source technology landscape

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,850
you wouldn't have been able to tell you

00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,470
could have gone and looked at react and

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,119
not really known that it had come from

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,909
Facebook I think that's that's really

00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:27,220
key that kind of tells you that what

00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,779
they're open sourcing isn't coupled to

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,940
their organization to their technical

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,919
infrastructure or to the way they go

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,309
about running their business I think you

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,600
can tell at the moment what's being open

00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:42,610
sourced by banks where it came from

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,460
which i think is a smell so I think we

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,070
need to do things differently I think

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,529
that we need to take a view top-down

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,909
what to make a utility and we're to

00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,009
compete in different shape now I'm not

00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,679
saying that we should Bank should form a

00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,119
monopoly but I am saying that forums

00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,399
like fin us are the right place for

00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,350
different banks to get together be open

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,909
about what they're doing internally be

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,279
open about how much they're spending on

00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,769
what your competitors are spending

00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:10,659
because I can tell you we are working

00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:12,519
for a number of you and you're spending

00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:13,240
this and spending a lot of money on very

00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:17,529
similar things

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,169
I think banks should open source their

00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:22,299
plumbing we think about it as we think

00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:24,399
about it so adaptive has some some IP

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,019
core infrastructure that we build our

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,990
trading platforms on and we try to keep

00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:30,399
that as below the line plumbing that our

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,259
clients don't care about and everything

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,379
they would talk to us about sort of

00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:38,409
above the line emphasis of the line code

00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:39,610
is when we deliver for them they own but

00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,779
the point is that banks need to

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,639
understand what is below the line

00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,289
plumbing that they don't care about that

00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:45,549
doesn't differentiate and they should

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:48,220
open source and build an ecosystem

00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,960
around it and beyond building an

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,399
ecosystem around it they should try to

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,470
make sure that that ecosystem is

00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:55,179
commercially viable and they should try

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,789
to encourage the formation of an

00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:00,039
ecosystem that itself generates revenues

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,049
through service and support one example

00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,129
or through other mechanisms but that

00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,690
ecosystem needs to become

00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:08,409
self-sustaining for the long-term

00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:12,399
benefits to accrue and it's also I think

00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:14,529
key for an ecosystem to form and people

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,169
may disagree with me on this that what

00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:20,259
gets open sourced should be fit for the

00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:23,139
capital markets world I see or we see I

00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:24,580
should say a lot of Silicon Valley

00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,760
technology getting picked up buying this

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,220
and banks and

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,360
used in the front office trading

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,190
environment which is what we're most

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,320
familiar with that really shouldn't be

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,430
there because it is built for a very

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,870
very different set of engineering

00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:40,940
constraints it isn't obvious on first

00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,140
blush but will become very obvious when

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,670
you have an outage and lose two days

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,970
worth of trades

00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,040
I think banks should focus on what they

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,760
do well and what differentiates them

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:55,430
from the rest of the sort of sectors in

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,530
the world and figure out what is core to

00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:01,010
that that isn't like everyone else but

00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,840
doesn't and but is common across all the

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,750
different financial services players and

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,310
open source that because it may not be

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,490
the Kate and it may not be the case that

00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:14,510
those pipes that plumbing has utility

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:17,900
for other industries we could also talk

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:20,360
about regulation which is kind of that

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,680
what you would expect people to say we

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,510
are being pushed towards an ever

00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,090
increasing amount of standardization I

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,980
think that there's an opportunity to do

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,030
something interesting there in various

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,130
places we were engaged last year in a

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:38,170
mutual eyes consortium to solve some

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,170
method - sorry for mentioning the word

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:44,720
requirements which worked well in terms

00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,730
of shared cost and now it's cut the

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,820
consortium has drifted apart which is a

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:52,490
shame but the idea that you could come

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,670
together around a very clear needed

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,870
requirement and be quite egoless about

00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:59,720
the fact that we all have to solve this

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:02,090
problem together five minutes I think

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,910
that's really important and if we could

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,290
just take what we learnt from doing it

00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,580
for regulation we might be able to solve

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,710
some real problems and save some money

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,490
on on other areas that that we don't

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,600
think of as shared need but actually are

00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:20,360
and last slide we were talking about

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,460
this internally and thinking about what

00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,780
the different evolution what what an

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,340
evolution could look like I think

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,220
there's a huge amount of closed source

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,990
software development that goes on that's

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,120
a traditional model and what people have

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,220
been doing for a very long time most

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,830
firms outside of financial services I

00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,100
think are very happy and pleasantly

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,380
contributing to

00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,669
open-source projects without even really

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,250
thinking about the regulatory of

00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,809
compliance or legal sides of it I hope

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,880
that doesn't blow up in their faces and

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:50,140
set us all back ten years but there's

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,940
what they're doing and there's

00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,440
mutualization which is what we what I

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,260
just mentioned on giving it's getting

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,400
several firms together to pull cost it's

00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,690
difficult because you need to get them

00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,640
all to agree to go in the same direction

00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,870
then you need to keep them all in their

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,200
jobs for eighteen months to get you

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,260
there

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,630
so lots of things need to go right you

00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,549
have the ability for firms to get

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,500
together to create a shared service as

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:12,940
an external vendor as an external

00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,980
platform a utility if you will that's

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,429
very interesting and we've seen quite a

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,960
few examples of that in the past the

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,669
technology doesn't end up open-source

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,010
but you you get the sort of shared

00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,440
service utility player into the market I

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,299
think anyone doing it now would need to

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,190
open-source the technology platform and

00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:32,010
self service and support on top of what

00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,690
they open-source as the business model

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:38,220
and then of course there's just a full

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,330
open-source model where potentially

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,830
previous versions of your core

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:47,020
infrastructure get released Google does

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:49,000
this really well Google is now on a few

00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,590
generations ahead of what they last

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,409
released to the world they do quite a

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,330
good job of open sourcing what was cool

00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,590
for them last year and the whole world

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,990
picks it up cause it's so far in the

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,690
future that sort of unrecognizable but

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,429
they yet so they drive a huge amount of

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,039
goodwill without really giving away

00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:07,450
there'd be a core competitive advantage

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,980
and they also do a great job of building

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,720
ecosystems around their products which

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,190
is which is really good to see here we

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,169
go

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,820
thank you very much for listening anyone

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:19,980
would like to tell me I'm completely

00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,530
wrong

00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:40,030
[Applause]

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:40,030
yeah please yeah what a loaded question

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,639
no no I would say what was it that the

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,840
what was that what is it the Chinese

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,310
philosopher said about the French

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,950
Revolution it's too soon to tell

00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,200
I don't actually I think it's really too

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:56,510
early to tell I think that that process

00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:01,040
has been good we see a lot of interest

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:03,440
and excitement in our clients a good

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,150
leading indicator is that four years ago

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,310
clients were asking us to build chat

00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,720
into the things we built for them no one

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,590
is asking us to build chat and to the

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,180
things they're building them they're

00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,010
asking us to integrate with Symphony so

00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,990
based on the points are making mean yet

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,340
it seems to be working well and we would

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,590
rather integrate with Symphony than

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:22,210
build another chat application

00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,210
differently yeah

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:45,570
yeah I think so I think that the it

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:49,260
requires an industry body to lead rather

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:55,380
than support or follow which is far from

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:57,030
simple I think that industry bodies who

00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,580
are funded by their members are often a

00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,780
little bit scared of leading too

00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,980
strongly and taking their members where

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,510
they may not want to go even if it's

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,740
good for the there's like a local

00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,360
optimization versus a global

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,160
optimization problem but I think in

00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,160
general yes you make a very bella point

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,260
I think it's I think it comes back to

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,530
I'm sure you've heard of Conway's law

00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:39,990
yeah I think it's it's that absolutely I

00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:42,180
mean we see over the years we've seen

00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,550
many many internally built trading

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,260
platforms all take a slightly different

00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,330
approach to solving very similar

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,860
problems and the differences are often

00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:54,560
due to the organizational structure that

00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:57,210
that built them some have depending on

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,280
depending on how far up the trail is a

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,870
really trivial example depending on how

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,210
far up the organizational tree you get

00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,980
to someone who's responsible for for

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,440
example fixed income and commodities you

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,660
go to the IT side of the fence and you

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,190
map it down to where they end up on a

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,370
shared stack and it's just like a

00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:20,010
one-to-one isomorphism I think it's

00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:21,070
largely no but if I could figure that

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:25,900
out I'd sell that

00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,900
[Laughter]

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:34,070
unfortunately I'm sorry yeah exactly

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,250
yeah yeah cool thank you very much

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,560
everyone Thanks

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:42,159
[Applause]
