Title: Open Source Culture, Standards, Risks, and Remediation: A Deep Dive 1 - Jeff Luszcz Day 2 OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management, Flexera Software
Presentation: Open Source Culture, Standards, Risks, and Remediation: A Deep Dive - Part One

The draw for financial services’ use of open source in today’s competitive environment is certainly built on the need to manage costs, but equally as important, to innovate and help solve business challenges. Implementing open source policies, processes and tools the right way could mean the difference between being a leader in the industry and costly mistakes that impact your reputation and bottom-line. In this session, Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management at Flexera, takes a deep dive into some of the common–and not so common–concerns and best practices surrounding using open source. Jeff will discuss the needs of the different open source culture types including compliance and security, how to manage commercial suppliers and compliance artifacts (third party notices, ‘About’ boxes, source bundles, etc.), and industry standards such as OpenChain and SPDX.
 
Jeff will address lessons learned from deploying software composition analysis (SCA) scanning tools across the enterprise, the importance of developing processes that enhance the value of engineers and developers versus making their jobs harder, and how legal, engineering, and security work together to develop remediation policies that make sense. Jeff will also discuss how to work best with Open Source projects in order to give back to the community. Join Jeff for this talk if you are involved in open source use, compliance and security and want an in-depth look at both the expected and unexpected issues you could face in your open source efforts.

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,990
just to give you a little Telegraph so a

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,220
little bit about myself my name is Jeff

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,420
lush I'm a VP at flex era you might have

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,820
heard of a company called Palomita and

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,010
I'm the founder Palomita back in 2003 we

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,900
were the first companies doing open

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,090
source license scanning compliance

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,250
vulnerability detection etc so I've been

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,969
working with companies about 15 years on

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,219
open source license discovery management

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,989
remediation M&A base line kind of

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,180
anything to do with the use of open

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,219
source and building software and things

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,350
like that if you have any questions

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,120
about the talk today please get in touch

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,190
with me and my email address address

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,559
which is je Lucia flex era or on Twitter

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,670
at Jeff flush and I always love hearing

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,629
from people who went to the shows here

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,370
so what we're gonna the classic I'm not

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,410
your lawyer I'm not a lawyer I'm not

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,850
even your programmer disclaimer here

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,899
we're going to talk about some licenses

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,170
we're going to talk about some best

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,970
practices if you really have questions

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,409
about how your company is using licenses

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,939
please talk to your lawyer

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,560
they're either going to have an answer

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,119
for you or you're gonna prompt them to

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,780
get some training and education about

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,299
the licenses you're using so let's hop

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,159
into it we're going to do a two-hour

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,350
session today the first half is going to

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,610
be around governance and vulnerabilities

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,619
and kind of some lessons learned in the

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,119
field the second half is going to be

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,119
about remediation some things that I've

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,100
seen have caused companies some pain and

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,579
how they've handled that and we'll also

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,570
have some QA as time goes on so a couple

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,430
things I'd like to talk about today

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,720
first thing is just what are we seeing

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,759
out there what are we seeing in the use

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,920
of open-source what are we seeing in the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
use of kind of the various licenses and

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,159
how people are using that we'll talk

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,320
about some open source government

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,899
governance and licensing basics as well

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,280
as to get into some of the sticky

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,310
wickets that people are finding

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,869
themselves so I think it's it's not a

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,960
surprise that people hear that

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,909
open-source is everywhere my experience

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,210
has been that the typical company's

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,420
codebase is at least 50% open-source and

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,370
in some cases is 99% open-source and

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,240
that that's a big surprise for companies

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,130
and especially in the financial

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,060
world where the traditional view is we

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,940
write every single line of code

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,500
ourselves but now with the explosion of

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,790
open source and the kind of opening of

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,830
people's eyes but what's actually being

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,330
done is we're seeing how much we're

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,100
actually writing versus how much our

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,080
puzzle pieces that were wiring together

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,210
and that's not a problem that's you know

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,680
we shouldn't be writing an XML parser we

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,600
shouldn't be writing a cryptographic

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,300
library in the financial services world

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,680
we should be taking best-of-breed wiring

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,960
them together and kind of using the the

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,670
benefit of the open source world we

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,650
officer also are consumers of other

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,300
people's products so it's not just the

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,770
products that we're building if the

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,690
products that we're depending on the IT

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,000
infrastructure etc that again is also

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,740
primarily open source these days and

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,300
that's a that's a great thing but

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,800
there's some risks and some challenges

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,500
and some some things that we need to do

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,790
in order to better manage it the other

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,990
thing I think is really changing and I

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,660
think this is especially helpful for

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:08,350
management is that how we build software

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,480
is changing 15 years ago 20 years ago

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,560
when a lot of the managers we're

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
learning how to write software if

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,610
they're technical folks every single

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,750
line of code was hand carried whether

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,310
it's from a book whether it's from a

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,080
partner whether it was from the

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,700
developer themselves hand carried to the

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,170
device entered in in source code

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,610
management and that's the way it went

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,960
you knew where every line of code came

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,790
from you know where every package came

00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,100
from if you needed to you to go look at

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,680
your bookshelf at the tapes or CDs or

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,140
DVDs of where third-party code came from

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,210
but we can't do that anymore right now

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,770
our developers have you know first day

00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,120
on the job we give them access to source

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,800
code management system we give them

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,590
access to a search engine and the

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,570
internet and we might not even be giving

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,850
them any education or training on

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,580
copyright or patents or open source

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,370
licensing we say go go be smart go go

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,720
write software for us and the world has

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,310
changed so if we're looking right now in

00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,660
the modern software company modern

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,000
financial services company

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,860
we're not hand carrying code line by

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,410
line from a book or for the Internet

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,330
we're not even just downloading things

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,160
from FTP sites we talked about github

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,290
and things like that we would click and

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,670
download the zip file but we're actually

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,530
using a lot of things like package

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,540
managers which is if you're not familiar

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,570
with is a a system for basically

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,160
carrying third-party libraries into your

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,600
codebase it might not even be checked

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,880
into your source code management system

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,230
these things that build time download

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
open source from

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,550
the Internet and put it into your

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,290
product and all its dependencies

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,700
containers it's interesting a couple

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,530
years ago a lot of people are saying oh

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,820
we're not shipping software anymore

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,950
everything software's a service

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,270
everything is on the on the web but

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,560
we've all seen the explosion of

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,850
containers and docker where we're

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,670
actually now shipping probably more

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,530
Linux as companies than we've done in

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,270
the generations ahead of time before us

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,220
and then maybe a little bit less

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,050
important for the financial world but

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,110
the IOT world the embedded world is

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,690
extremely extremely common to see

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,370
embedded systems Linux systems mostly

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,740
open source in the IOT world and

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,760
obviously Linux is predominantly open

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:10,560
source Internet of Things so embedded

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,060
devices sensors and things like that so

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,860
in the last year people's eyes have

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,350
really been open to the vulnerabilities

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,970
that are present just in all software

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,330
people sometimes pick on open source

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,130
software

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,620
I don't think open source software is a

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,330
problem it's all software has bugs and

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,160
we need to know what what software were

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,230
using what vulnerabilities are there I

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,560
think the open source vulnerabilities

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,900
kind of get big press primarily because

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,420
that's open source one where we're using

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,250
open source pretty much in every device

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,660
and every application it is the

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,330
underpinnings of everything that we use

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,850
and since it's ubiquitous and it's

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,280
something that hackers know is going to

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,590
be there they can use that as an attack

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,330
vector because they know that open SSL

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,710
is going to be on every device they know

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,150
that struts to is going to be in pretty

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,040
much every Java application that's

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,260
exporting as interface so these are why

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,240
these are targets I think the financial

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,280
services industry had their eyes opened

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,420
about a year ago in terms of how much

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,640
open source was actually being used

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,010
versus what kind of their gut feeling

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,190
was telling them and also it showed just

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,690
that the management processes that are

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,580
that were in place I think are still in

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,860
place we're not sufficient in order to

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,300
tell you what bill of materials of open

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,850
source we're using basing your list of

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,110
of things that we depend on how old they

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,790
are what versions and what

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,960
vulnerabilities are there and I'll talk

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,910
a little bit more about this during the

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,800
next you know two hours around the

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,530
session but at the heart of it I like

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,020
using these libraries as good tests

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,640
basically thermometer reading of how our

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,350
applications are and how our processes

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,360
are if you go back to your teams and you

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,300
say I

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,650
using OpenSSL how many copies where do

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,810
they come from what are the versions

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,729
it's a great bellwether for how

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,509
everything else is being run because we

00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,639
had the big heartbleed vulnerability

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,770
about four years ago everybody's eyes

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,569
were open to open SSL and

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,120
vulnerabilities we did a lot of work in

00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,400
the industry to fix fix our act back

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,750
then my experience has shown that that

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,219
was kind of a flash in the pan

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,830
basically everybody did a lot of work

00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,349
but then we kind of left things alone

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,599
and we haven't gone back to keep those

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,979
you know in many places update those

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,719
versions keep track of the

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,909
vulnerabilities that come out struts

00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,520
struts - which was generally recognized

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:19,680
as safe' it was a great library great

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,000
great permissive license people didn't

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,169
really keep track of it the

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,759
vulnerability came out and kind of

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,719
caught the industry by surprise and

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,460
we've seen what happened there so this

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,379
is you know those are individual items

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,319
and I think when we look here as the as

00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,479
the end builders of applications we're

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,069
depending on a software supply chain and

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,539
the software supply chain is becoming

00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,460
more complex I talked a little bit more

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,469
about those repository managers we

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,240
talked about how the code gets to you

00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,979
but this is another really important

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,669
thing as you design your processes as

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,719
you design your your kind of policies

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,190
about what's allowed and what's not

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,620
allowed it's really important not just

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,930
to have a feeling about what licenses

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,810
are we using do we like the GPL do we

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,539
like the Apache 200 cetera but also how

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,370
does code come into our company we saw

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,650
from the presentation just a little

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,330
while ago about all the wires and all

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,919
the instrumentation that that people

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,389
will look at and say code is coming here

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,060
and I'm going to block code from going

00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,810
out that way that is something that is

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,699
really important I think for

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,279
organizations to look at how does code

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,229
come in is it open source is it from

00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,180
other projects at our company is it

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,159
partner code in commercial code we we

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,060
always talk about open source but when

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,199
you come back and you say how many

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,879
partners do we depend on how many

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,919
commercial libraries and products we

00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,740
depend on is often ignored by this

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,209
process as well what did we write what

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,099
did our what did our developers write on

00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,659
their own time and so on mix that all

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,490
together each of these triangles

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,750
represents a place where third-party

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,339
code whether it's open source or

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,019
commercial comes into our organization

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,270
maybe for something that we use as

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,010
tooling maybe part of our product may be

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,319
part of the IT infrastructure that our

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,190
developers don't even care about but

00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,290
it's something we're

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,860
ends up running all of these have things

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,990
that we need to manage and discover and

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,330
so what do we see so I've been helping

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,890
companies for about 15 years we have a

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,930
lot of experience from people say come

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,850
in and run a scan and tell us what we're

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,010
actually using or about to buy a company

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,300
and they say they're only using X can

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,060
you tell us what they're really using

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,440
and I have some data here that they'd be

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,700
available in the slides afterward but

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,750
basically shows what's the size of a

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,610
typical application in 2017-2018 that's

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,620
the blue bar and the yellow bar

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,110
represents what each engineering team

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,790
was actually able to tell us what they

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,950
thought they were using before scanner

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,220
analysis was done and basically what we

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,080
see is this is on the order of 25 times

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,670
difference between what people think

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,560
they really are using and which actually

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,730
going out the door and this just shows

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,010
the big disconnect I think between

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,110
engineering management engineers the

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,580
tooling that's available and also I

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,260
think the expectations for the company

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,450
about what actually has to be done and

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,490
you'll you'll see going back about you

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,500
know five six years here is just how

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,690
we're starting to see this ramp up part

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,690
of this ramp up is the the new

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,390
technologies that are coming in NPM the

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,620
kind of the JavaScript ecosystem that

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,390
people are using a lot we see this a lot

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,160
of financial services this has kind of

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,230
changed the component counts from maybe

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,150
a hundred or two hundred libraries to

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,380
literally two thousand three thousand

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,080
libraries in a single application

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,700
they're all very small pieces the old

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,950
java world from five years ago we'd have

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,870
these huge monolithic pieces we'd bring

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,790
in maybe 100 of them now in a JavaScript

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,380
world we bring in these tiny little

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,180
pieces that we wire together but we have

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,000
thousands of them all from different

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,830
authors maybe come up primarily with a

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,630
single site license type but we don't

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,120
know until we do analysis or do a review

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,950
and I don't I don't see this pace

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,600
slowing down if anything I think we're

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,070
gonna see more things like NPM where we

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,020
see more and more smaller pieces being

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,270
aggregated together but I also haven't

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,339
seen the industry really change in terms

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,470
of how we're managing things if you go

00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,150
back five six years same type of count

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,160
we know about twenty know about two

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,020
dozen components that we're using oh we

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,700
use my sequel oh we use this we use that

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,170
but they're not really catching the long

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,160
tail and the big tail of everything

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,160
that's there that question in the back

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,399
yeah I think what we see is we see that

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,380
the common license types it's kind of

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,660
mixed most people don't disclose GPL

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,240
even if they're using it they're gonna

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,529
disclose kind of the well-known

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,569
components they might disclose open SSL

00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,459
because their customers asked for it

00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:29,490
they might disclose their application

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:31,829
servers like Tomcat or Python or NPM

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,899
because it's a thing that's underpinning

00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,399
the whole application but the vast

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,160
majority of items are just not paying

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,360
attention to that the license is that

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,069
you can file a name off the top of your

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,449
the top of your head or probably you're

00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,620
gonna see those licenses there the

00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:48,240
Apache the VST the MIT it also depends

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,009
on what ecosystem in you're in if you're

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,410
an automotive you expect to see general

00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,120
public license these strong you know the

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,399
licenses that are underneath clinics if

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,839
you're in finance you probably don't

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,209
expect to see general public general

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,310
public license code there so maybe it's

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,600
gonna be more toward Apache or cuddle or

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,269
MIT and I'll talk about what some of

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
those acronyms mean in a little bit here

00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,470
so what what do people disclose they

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,040
typically disclose their databases it's

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,810
close they're the kind of network

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,149
infrastructure they're they're openness

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,829
of cells etc but they kind of miss the

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,009
main inventory the core inventory that

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,420
the 590 other items that are actually

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,959
being used but they're not they're not

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,589
talking about so let's talk a little bit

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,029
like the underpinnings of open source is

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,380
the licensing I think this is really

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,120
extremely important to understand the

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,310
culture and the understanding of how we

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,560
got to where we are and I think we're

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,240
also in the middle of a next shift in

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,209
licensing I'll talk about that a little

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,769
bit but basically we've always had open

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,720
source it might not have been called

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,880
open source but went back in the 40s 50

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,529
60 70 s when you bought a device it was

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,269
be basically the hardware dongle was

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,360
this mainframe and the source code came

00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,709
along for free that people didn't care

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,660
about licensing as much or was this

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,829
assumed like well I'm gonna copy it for

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,490
you I'm gonna give it to you the tape

00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:08,339
etc but in the in the 80s we started to

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,829
see you know computer costs came down

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,970
the the software itself became a

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:14,410
differentiator between companies we had

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,029
what was called the UNIX wars where

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,060
everybody had a UNIX variant that

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,800
they're trying to trying to sell and I

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,209
think we started to have the beginnings

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,889
of the network culture we have the

00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:27,160
beginning of the internet we had ARPANET

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:29,199
etc and we had you know in the early 80s

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,519
freeware everybody had shareware free

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,470
works that are things like that

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,029
maybe not for commercial purposes but in

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,980
the consumer space so people started to

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,600
think about sharing code they started to

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,149
think about maybe I pay for it maybe I

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,730
try before I buy it etc and then there

00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:45,220
was kind of a milestone in 1985 we had

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,480
that first kind of classic open-source

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,129
license that we're still using to this

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,410
day relatively untouched which was known

00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:52,660
as the MIT license or the x11 license

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,930
this is the the same license that NPM

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,360
uses for a lot of their modules so

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:01,329
written in 85 still still modern still

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,740
being used still still important and

00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:04,990
then right very right after that we had

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,220
kind of a response to again the UNIX

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,500
Wars and whatnot which was the first

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,089
general public license which basically

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,250
was a lie cyclists if you're using my

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,050
code if you're shipping my code let

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,089
people know that you're using something

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,779
from me put my name in the about box of

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:24,220
documentation in 1988 the first general

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,399
public license came out and the idea

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,290
there was credit is not enough I need to

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,730
have access to the software the source

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,339
code itself and that's where the free

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,420
software movement came when we talked

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,240
about free software it's really this

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,519
culture of saying I expect the code to

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,559
be shared if I get a product if I get a

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,809
device if I get something I should be

00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,120
able to hack it and change it and modify

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,529
it and make it fit for my purposes that

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,180
may be different than the classic

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,009
commercial world which is I ship you

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,629
something and I don't I expect you not

00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:55,149
to hack it I expect you not to change it

00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:56,709
and it's interesting because those two

00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,420
licenses came out and they're kind of

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,160
the underpinnings of the open-source

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,720
world right now we really see that since

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,699
the kind of the heart of the two

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,990
different types of movements that we see

00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:07,360
an open-source one is about giving

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,100
credit kind of preserving ownership and

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,009
give them credit the other is around

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,110
sharing the technology and rising rising

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:16,779
tide raises all ships if you found value

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,730
in this you should pass on your changes

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,029
and your code as well so that we all get

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,319
extra value

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,240
after that there was a couple of the

00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:26,100
licenses the BSD license which is very

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
very common very similar to the MIT

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,639
really about giving

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,990
Griffing credit and then people found

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,870
that there were some problems with the

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,509
GPL was maybe seen as too strong and we

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,870
saw the LGPL come out back there and in

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:41,939
1991 and the LGPL means the lesser

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,829
general public license or the library

00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,930
general public license it basically says

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,910
is you know what we want people to build

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,009
software with open-source we want the

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,600
sharing of this core technology but

00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,310
maybe we can leave some things

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,290
proprietary so if you're a commercial

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,509
company and you you build some product

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,180
we happen to use a library that has the

00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:02,699
LGPL license and you improve that

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,639
library expectation is you give those

00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,870
changes back to the community to your

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,600
customers the community in general but

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,069
maybe it doesn't you know affect the

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,300
other code that you wrote that's outside

00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:14,610
of that library like and that was a

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,829
really important kind of cultural change

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,079
in licensing which says we want to share

00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:21,839
a lot of things but maybe not everything

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,759
that touches against it and then the

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,309
internet really exploded and we saw the

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,809
affair Oh license come out in 2002 and

00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,970
then with a refresh of all these

00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,800
licenses in 2007 and what the affair Oh

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,110
license brought to the world is saying

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,209
we live in an Internet world now we

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,100
don't distribute every product I'm not

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,170
giving you a tape or a DVD or a CD

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,660
anymore you're coming into your web

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,980
browser and with the affair license and

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,500
then the modified version which was a

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,019
pharoah GPL that came out to this 2007

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,329
basically said is if you are providing a

00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,370
network service and we can talk about

00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:55,589
the both the specifics of the legal the

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,610
legal terms of the a GPL or the feral

00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,610
license but basically if you're

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,199
providing a internet service and maybe

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,449
you've made some modifications to the

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,829
the a GPL code behind the scenes the

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:06,780
expectation is that you're going to give

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,220
the source code away to your Internet

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,959
users the people coming in through the

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,730
network and we can we can spend a whole

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,799
two hours talking about the a GPL and

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,150
the GPL but that's kind of the you know

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,280
the Asterix on that is kind of the

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,929
general idea about what's going on

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,579
behind the scenes there and that that

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,339
was in 2007 I think that was kind of the

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,199
last seismic shift we had in the

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,270
open-source world and licensing and I

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,610
feel like we're about wrong a cusp of

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,320
that next generation we're starting to

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,760
see people put out proposals for new

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,640
licenses we're starting to see some

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,280
pressure in the

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,440
for world saying I don't want certain

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,420
Network access I don't want certain

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,010
companies taking my open-source and

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,670
providing that as a service and so on

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,560
and so on

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,060
maybe not finding that the a GPL is

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,190
sufficient for that so we start to see

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,140
some things like the common clause which

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,670
was an additional term which I wouldn't

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,750
consider open-source it's kind of a

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,130
commercial restriction but we're

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,200
starting to see stuff like that put on

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,780
we start to see some patent clauses

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,480
coming on to the licenses and I wouldn't

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,400
be surprised if over the next year or so

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,460
we start to see some pressure from large

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,350
open source based companies who have a

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,660
lot of value behind them who are now

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,130
having some battles over what is

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,630
expected from an open source and

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,860
commercial world I don't quite know

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,730
where that's going from right now but I

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,440
think that's something a lot of our

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,240
clients are paying attention to which is

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,800
we're using open source we're specially

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,470
using open source that is backed by

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,110
large unicorn billion-dollar companies

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,600
that is a bet open sources sometimes

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,270
seen as a different maybe a different

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,220
culture than the classic philosophical

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,630
open source from writing something

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,790
because I want the whole world to have

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,830
it I don't have a company behind it etc

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,940
so kind of watch this space but I know a

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,140
lot of the folks who are paying

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,450
attention especially the database

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,280
database space we're paying a lot of

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,240
attention to what might be coming down

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,130
the line in terms of license changes so

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,490
at the heart of it open sources around

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,840
obligations back in the 80s if I wanted

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,310
to use your code I would call you

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,650
literally up on the phone on the phone

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,970
and say can I use your code no cost you

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,320
this money or yeah of course you can

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,100
I'll send you the tape will send you the

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,260
latest updates

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,550
the idea behind Oken source license is

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,350
we don't want to have to have a personal

00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,930
one-on-one phone call to get permission

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,880
to use your code I can write down in my

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,800
license basically a set of expectations

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,290
and obligations and you as an

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,940
open-source user will say of course yes

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,620
I can do this I can do this oh I can't

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,270
do that well I can't use this library

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,730
can't use this license I'll go look

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,170
someplace else so it's really important

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,330
for us to understand the obligations and

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,610
I think as an industry we've not done a

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,890
really good job in terms of actually

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,050
following up on the obligations if you

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,090
go look at the typical software company

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,970
and you say are we using open-source yes

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,580
are we tracking at all no is our lpaz

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,990
our about box have all the things that

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,440
the licenses tell us that's supposed to

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,660
be there

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,380
most companies I would say no are we

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,540
using

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,040
certain libraries that expect us to pass

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,290
along that source code kind of that

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,690
shared source most companies are not

00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,670
doing that are we marking things

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,630
properly no we're kind of using it but

00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,830
we're not following these obligations

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,660
and I think we're starting to see some

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,880
more pressure in terms of the open

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,950
source world themselves to say it's a

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,330
two-way street you know we gave this to

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,350
you you know kind of out of the goodness

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,890
of our hearts but you're really not

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,140
we're not doing the right thing and part

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,210
of that is tooling I think it's it's

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,860
very difficult and if achill for people

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,840
to discover and track and then comply

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,610
with these obligations a lot of this

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,770
comes from management expectations and

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,360
if we're all we all have software teams

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,520
reporting to us and we don't give them

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,770
space on their roadmap to comply with

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,260
open source licensing you get what you

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,300
measure and so we should on our roadmaps

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,700
have explicit open source compliance we

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,380
should have the obligation management we

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,540
should make sure that's built in part of

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,810
our process and our engineers understand

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,030
what's expected of them and and I think

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,810
at the heart of it we should be using

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,340
you know we should be using the

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,230
libraries that use the licenses that

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,060
we're able to comply with and if we're

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,620
using libraries that have licenses and

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,640
we can't comply with don't use them or

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,780
remove them remediate them at the heart

00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,160
of it that's what we call open source

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:05,260
compliance or OSS compliance there's

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,850
some commonly seen obligations that are

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,650
out there I think at the heart of it we

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,940
saw those two philosophies before kind

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,190
of the give credit where credit's due

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,740
and the other one is to share the source

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,990
code so that we all benefit from from

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,730
that shared shared resource those are

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,800
kind of the two philosophies out there

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,450
there's many many other obligations that

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,690
we'll see even in those those existing

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:29,140
licenses there's there's some in some

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,460
cases some patent obligations and patent

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,470
restrictions so if you are an

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,520
organization that has a lot of patents

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,320
or expect that you're going to be

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,850
patenting certain things and enforcing

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,220
your patents you should be paying

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,230
attention to the patent aspects of the

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,280
licenses or the culture of what you're

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,630
using and I'll talk a little bit about

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,430
that in the second half around some of

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,830
the places we see that but typically

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,780
around multimedia so audio video is most

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,760
common places there may be some

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,200
restrictions on use and so I think one

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,390
of the issues we have here is everybody

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,100
talks about open source open source has

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,840
actually a very specific definition so

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,330
is it free software is it open source is

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,010
a visible source so some of these things

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,540
actually be restrictions that someone in

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,160
the open-source world will say oh that's

00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,350
not open-source like something that

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,410
restricts use is technically not

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,850
open-source but we we we I think we have

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,800
a somewhat lack of terms to kind of

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,690
mention this third-party software I like

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,730
using saying open-source and third-party

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,440
software it'd be nice if we had a term

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,880
that kind of covered all of that but in

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,470
general it's basically code we didn't

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,360
write that came from the outside but

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,880
restrictions on use is very common to

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,310
see we see a lot of things that say not

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,350
for commercial use and that's not

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,600
open-source and probably most of us we

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,310
paid for a conference today we're

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,890
probably commercial users or many of us

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,180
are commercial users so we can define as

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,890
this commercial use or not commercial

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,080
use I kind of fall on the side of if it

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,810
says not for commercial use we probably

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,850
shouldn't be using it in general you may

00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,230
be able to negotiate that with that

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,520
author but there's usually a reason

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,770
they're concerned about getting sued

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,630
they're concerned about liability are

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,980
the two most typical reasons why

00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,810
somebody will mark their code not for

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,390
commercial use we'll also see some other

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,610
restrictions if you're using certain

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,650
Java examples that come from Sun or

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,720
Oracle they looks plis utley say not for

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,550
avionics use not for use in a nuclear

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,170
power plant those are some pretty

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,480
serious restrictions and I am sure

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,890
there's design and running of nuclear

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,630
power plant code right now that that's

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,940
being based on that code even though it

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,320
explicitly says not for that use so

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,790
understanding your use if you're in the

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,880
military if you're in certain

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,770
organizations that may be doing certain

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,120
things politically you always want to

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,580
pay attention to those restrictions of

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,290
use that's gonna be these vanity and

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,670
one-off licenses I'll show example in

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,220
just a little bit here but these cause

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,110
the most legal annoyance they're like

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,450
one out of a thousand libraries going to

00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,630
use but everybody then sits here and is

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,070
debating about are we doing you know why

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,390
did we pick this library we're not going

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,520
to spend thousands of dollars a legal

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,560
time analyzing something that probably

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,060
is a one-off throwaway library so we'll

00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,680
talk about that but basically these are

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,960
not the classic licenses they're not the

00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,360
names that you see it's not MIT GPL a

00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,920
Ferro it's somebody just wrote something

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,650
that looks like a license that then has

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,190
to be interpreted the attribution the

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:09,010
disclaimers the preserve and pass on the

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,690
license text and then lastly classic

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,820
commercial terms so it's not obviously

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,230
not open source but open the commercial

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,240
world is how to modify how they do

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,340
licensing

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,919
because of what open source has done so

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,909
we start to see more free free code

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,850
that's out there that's still

00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,990
commercially licensed it's still

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,580
commercial terms but maybe it's not a

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,750
click maybe it's a click-through maybe

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,159
it's just you don't even have to click

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,750
through it's just it's not you don't

00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,520
have to pay but there's gonna be things

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,260
like you know don't use this for this

00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,059
type of service or all allowed only on

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,710
this type of operating system that not

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,950
that operating system so these are

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,799
commonly seen obligations most

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,570
developers I think do not have the

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,610
knowledge of this they they might have

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,350
some simple policy we lose this license

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,120
we don't use this license when you get

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,440
into obligation management this is

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,110
something I think does not currently

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,190
have an owner in most companies legal

00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,600
kind of things engineering is going to

00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,770
do it engineering thinks that somebody

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,059
there must be a lawyer somewhere in the

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,169
organization's that's handling all these

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:06,059
things and it's kind of this orphan so

00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,679
we talked about these the two common

00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,570
license philosophies here there's a

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,419
couple examples of some licenses here so

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,340
that copyleft copyleft is that idea of

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,020
we're gonna share that source code you

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,309
sometimes will hear people say viral I

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,899
don't I don't like that term but you'll

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,840
hear that term out there the idea is

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:24,510
that this code if infects other other

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,340
code with those terms I just put it out

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,049
there so you know that term I don't like

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,940
it but general public license is the

00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:31,529
most common one you'll also see the

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,500
lesser or the library general public

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,929
license the affair oh those are strong

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,309
and weak so some some is the whole

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:39,779
product has to be given away if you

00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,880
distribute it the week is just the

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,890
section this library and you'll see some

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,500
other licenses that have those terms

00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:49,529
like the the mozilla license the cuddle

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,360
the CDL license very commonly used very

00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:53,460
business-friendly but kind of have these

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,020
what we call weak copy left if you make

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,390
some modifications you're expected to

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,340
pass those along and then are then the

00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,950
permissive which I think many companies

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,649
really prefer the permissive license is

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,809
the BSD the MIT the Apache Software

00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:09,149
license is one one two Oh et cetera

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:11,279
there's a long tail of other licenses as

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,049
well that are they're seen as permissive

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,029
there will be to some discussion and

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:17,789
debate is it permissive is it academic

00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:18,630
is it attribution licenses I think in

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,190
general we don't have to have an

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,730
argument about what we call it because

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,020
the general idea is you know we we need

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,850
to give credit where credit's do we need

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,679
to preserve these um these attributions

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,370
and the notices and you'll see different

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,440
culture

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,929
it's like the Linux world is more this

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,700
culture of the top type of license the

00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:38,070
the web world is going to be perhaps

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,289
more of this culture of the bottom type

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,610
type of licenses and what you see now

00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:43,230
like in the financial services world

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,360
we're dealing with containers we're

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,429
dealing with hosting operating systems

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,620
we're gonna have half of our world like

00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:51,179
our IT infrastructure is really going to

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,830
be this style license and the

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,440
applications we write are really going

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,600
to be the style of license and we have

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,160
IT team dealing with this development

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,570
team dealing with this but then running

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,010
their software on top of those types of

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,200
licenses it's really important for us to

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,970
understand how these licenses work

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,299
together and how these two cultures

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,650
might might clash I told you I'll give

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,870
you a couple examples of some vanity

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,150
licenses my favorite is the free beer

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,650
license which almost certainly you guys

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,450
are using somewhere in your applications

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,860
right now basically says as long as you

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,299
leave the retain this notice you can do

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,620
whatever you want with this stuff if we

00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,090
meet some day and you think this stuff

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,460
is worth that you can buy me a beer in

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,020
return so this is this is a great

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,250
license if you go look at your phone

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,419
right now you might be able to find this

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,730
and some of the about boxes and the

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,070
applications you're using we also see

00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,169
the the good not evil

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,049
this software shall be used for good not

00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:42,169
evil classic vanity license I can't tell

00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:45,539
you how many legal hours have been spent

00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:47,250
arguing about this and that's just

00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,750
something we see is every every codebase

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,909
is going to have a couple of these

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,409
almost joke licenses or funny licenses

00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:54,450
that bring this humor into the

00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:56,730
engineering world but the legal world

00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,750
really doesn't like to interpret humor

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:02,159
and this is if we can like you can't get

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,990
away from the json license if you were

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,220
using json as a file format almost

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,480
certainly you're gonna have this this

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,030
license somewhere in your code base is

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,830
this there there's some other licenses i

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,450
don't put up here that have swear words

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,760
in their name and in the license text

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,380
and we all know perhaps what what you'll

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,730
know it when you see it that's the type

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,470
of thing you sometimes will see as part

00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,679
of major libraries but then when it

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,090
comes to disclosure or compliance and

00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,020
you're sitting here in a room and people

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,600
are saying i can't even read this

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,400
license name not always the most

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,350
professional thing to see and it can

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,580
cause some compliance issues because are

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,080
we gonna disclose this to our customers

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,520
should we use this we've already built

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,799
it we've already shipped it now you have

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,620
that issue so the vanity license i think

00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,509
are kind of the their annoyance kind of

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,589
outweighs their utility into the code

00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,029
based but almost certain you're gonna

00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:48,329
you're gonna see these and you deal with

00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:49,889
these so why do you need it I always

00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,969
like having this slide because I can't

00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,859
tell you many people come to me and say

00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:54,989
my developers tell me we can do anything

00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,309
we want we can do the XYZ or we don't

00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:58,019
have to follow this because of copyright

00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:59,609
law bla bla bla bla there will be these

00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:01,949
arguments I think in some companies

00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:03,869
about copyright law and patent law and

00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:06,539
all that and I think at the heart of it

00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:08,249
is just as an organization copyright law

00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,209
exists wherever you are in the world

00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:11,309
you're gonna have different copyright

00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:13,139
laws but at the heart of it that is what

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:16,499
underpins open source and the open

00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:18,359
source licenses and as a company we're

00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:20,249
not gonna fight copyright we you know we

00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,509
maybe will in some cases we might have a

00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:23,819
legitimate reason but if we're using

00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:25,229
open source we have to follow the law we

00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:26,729
have to follow the licenses we're gonna

00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:29,129
we may interpret them one way or another

00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:31,679
but but we shouldn't be having arguments

00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:42,509
with our developers about copyright law

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:43,919
etcetera yes I'm not a lawyer I don't

00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:45,419
wanna I wanna I don't want to argue but

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,129
one way but I think at the heart of his

00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,809
as a copyright owner you pretty much are

00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,429
able to put whatever terms you want on

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,619
you know within the realm of copyright

00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:55,229
and so dual license is seen I think as

00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:56,699
perfectly permissible and if you say if

00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:58,199
you want it under this if you do this

00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:59,459
thing you can use it under this license

00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,989
if you want it under this license you

00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:02,309
can say and in the second half we'll

00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:04,769
talk more about dual licensing as well

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,059
but I I've never seen anybody really

00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,579
fight against dual licensing from a

00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:10,619
copyright perspective so I think the

00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,239
sooner we can I've seen a lot again a

00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:14,819
lot of legal ink and a lot of time and

00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:17,249
emails internally and companies arguing

00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,499
about is copyright law and licensing

00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,489
even in effect and I think if the sooner

00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,959
you can kind of shut down that

00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:24,809
discussion the better because it just

00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:26,190
never seems to go anywhere fruitful but

00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:27,719
the the kind of the flip side of this is

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,429
if you don't have an open-source license

00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:31,619
you really don't have permission to use

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:33,629
somebody else's code and we can put all

00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,879
asterisks on fair use and all that but I

00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:38,909
think as a commercial company I have

00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:40,319
never really seen a case where people

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:41,609
have been very happy to go out and use

00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,979
somebody else's code without an explicit

00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:45,690
license we want certainty we want we

00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:47,879
want permission especially for going to

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,139
be shipping a billion copies of

00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,119
something or we're going to be hosting a

00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:54,430
billion dollars worth of financial

00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,780
service isn't it so

00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,420
one thing here is what does compliance

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,280
look like I think people are still

00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,510
looking for good models of compliance

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,220
and I'll show a couple examples in a

00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,740
couple slides here but the general idea

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,940
is what open-source are we're using what

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,850
are those obligations what's our

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,490
internal policy on that and then what

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,500
are the visible indicators of compliance

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,840
how do our users how do our customers

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,890
know where to go to say we know what

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,710
open source they're using they're

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,900
following all the obligations etc etc so

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,430
here's a kind of a laundry list of

00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,230
places where your customers are going to

00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,660
be looking for compliance and maybe your

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,640
open source authors will be so

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,900
copyrights in your about box is a very

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,670
common thing if you have your phone

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,280
pretty much any phone if you go to

00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,710
general about or general legal you're

00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,900
gonna see a list of licenses they're my

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,940
gut feel tells me that that you that you

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,800
I that dialog box is not large enough to

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,480
actually hold all the licenses that are

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,060
in the phone there but it's a good

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,980
example the documentation that you pass

00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,480
on many of the open source licenses

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,190
actually will say that you have to pass

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,530
along in the documentation or that's one

00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,060
off one way you have to pass the license

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,670
text and that should be the actual

00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:04,120
license text I've seen a lot of

00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:06,460
companies kind of hack that or not quite

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,840
do that or even the open source projects

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,910
don't do a good job they say we're

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,130
licensed under the MIT but they actually

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,480
never give you the license text of the

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,560
license that they say that they're under

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,880
so these are the things where both the

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,850
open open source world in the commercial

00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,410
world still has a lot to do a lot to go

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,200
in terms of kind of cleaning up their

00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,060
act and making it very clear to users if

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,590
you're using GPL and LGPL and you're

00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,720
shipping that to your customers as a

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,160
mobile app or a container you have to

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,530
preserve that source code and pass it

00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,150
along either at delivery time or give a

00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,740
written offer and I think many many

00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,420
people that you'll talk to say it's best

00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,920
to do it right the first time you don't

00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,780
want to have to scramble after the fact

00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,430
to try to find the exact source code

00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,620
that you shipped and some of the biggest

00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,640
kind of LGPL and GPL issues that i've

00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,010
seen out there especially with the

00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,740
handset manufacturers of phones has been

00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,350
arguing about specific versions oh we we

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,550
released version 101 of the source code

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,770
and the community says no you're

00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,880
actually using 101 B and that's not the

00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:01,710
right source code and they have to keep

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,060
going back to the well to deliver that

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,670
we'll talk about what like web service

00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,320
SLA is and commercial licenses etc but

00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,909
the heart of it is you're using a lot of

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,710
people's stuff you need to know what the

00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:13,570
terms are there and you need to do

00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,860
compliance on every release I see a lot

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,620
of companies if they're doing compliance

00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,090
at all it's once a year or it's once a

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,559
major release or it's when a major

00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,960
customer tells them that they need to

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,880
and they scramble to do that I think the

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,559
hope here is of tooling and culture and

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,110
compliance is that we make this like

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,000
breathing if I make a release I'm using

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,950
my continuous integration system the

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,840
hope is that we can deliver all of this

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:39,940
as part of that I think that's still a

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,950
ways out you know I don't think they

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,779
even realize that this is out there I I

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:46,210
think they're starting to see I think

00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,980
Equifax and struts it's open them I've

00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:51,429
done this very similar talk with the

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:53,320
inside auditor groups and they're

00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,639
starting you know they're scribbling at

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,809
the right points which tells me that a

00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:57,100
couple of years from now we're gonna

00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,629
start seeing that guidance coming in

00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,940
from the inside auditors around open so

00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:02,889
it's already there but I think it's it's

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,750
at a very aspirational you know you

00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:08,230
should do the right thing as opposed to

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:10,839
you must do you shall do this etc etc we

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,940
do see this in like the the you know the

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,800
the company reports every year we'll see

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,440
a kind of blurb that says we depend on

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,669
open source one paragraph and that I may

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,230
affect you may have risks and

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:22,089
obligations you know that may affect

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,490
value but that's all I've seen currently

00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:39,460
I think I think it will be coming we've

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:41,980
seen III have seen companies in general

00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,089
if they can if it looks like there's

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,409
something that should be donation away

00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,050
they're gonna treat that as commercial

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:49,060
and they they pay and they preserve that

00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,669
that email thread or that payment thread

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,659
and they put it in the right place

00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:54,280
sometimes when people actually check in

00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,440
that email into the code base itself

00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,060
other people just preserve that as part

00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,060
of the legal you know legal documents

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:17,180
yeah damage someone yeah yeah yep and so

00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,590
and we'll talk a little bit more about

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,500
the commercial world but in general you

00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,670
see classic commercial you see

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,490
click-throughs and then you see quasi

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,050
commercial donation where etc where the

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,420
question is you know is it worth us

00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,470
paying you know the 25 which we just go

00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,060
try to find an open source library

00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,350
instead and not have to worry about the

00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,170
payment and the updates and things like

00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:38,450
that in a commercial relationship you

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,580
asked before about lit a cut of the

00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,620
auditors and whatnot I am seeing in like

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,090
healthcare and the FDA in the United

00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,010
States is putting out the kind of a

00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,510
notice of rulemaking saying they they

00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,400
expect to see a software bill of

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,200
materials for every device so it's not

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,970
required yet but they're telegraphing

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,970
this is coming yes

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,390
yeah and I think that's always it's

00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:22,190
understood to understand the culture and

00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,630
the potential people who are doing

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,160
enforcement actions and things like that

00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,320
I think at the heart of it we should be

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,390
doing compliance for compliance sake but

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:59,150
there are some reasons you can go back

00:36:29,390 --> 00:37:02,860
to your organization this helps I agree

00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,860
and I think we should expect it coming

00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,280
and it's I think it's it's out of the

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,420
bag it's it's coming and we should

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,460
expect for an especially if you're in

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:30,440
those I think finance I think health

00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:32,060
care energy transportation power oil gas

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,100
those are all organizations that we

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,960
should really expect that if we don't do

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,550
a good job we're gonna be told what to

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,590
do and I think most people don't like

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,270
being told what to do in the military

00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,870
exactly

00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,930
