	Speaker:Nick Kolba, CTO, OpenFin
Presentation: FDC3 and the Legacy of Web Intents

Why Web Intents is the model: All financial applications are moving to web, The stated goal of web intents is what we want in finance, De-centralized. Why web intents failed: politics, Too broad , UX issues that can’t be solved without aggregator platforms. Why FDC3 won’t: timing, Industry specific focus, A different kind of User Agent (Desktop Agent / OpenFin Approach).

00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:19,430
I'm Nick Koba I am a person that opened

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,430
Finn and I also had out the FT C 3

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:36,000
organization is topic and of

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,260
interoperability on the desktop on the

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,180
financial desktop specifically and why I

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,969
feel so passionately about it I would

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,829
spend probably like an insane amount of

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,039
time in the last year of my life just

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,079
banging my head against this topic but

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:57,980
as many many other people in this room

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:02,670
have not hey Rico so here we go

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,769
interoperability is magical it's

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,229
absolutely a magical thing for those of

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,810
you who are at Finn Jess last night you

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,369
know this firsthand because for some

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,590
crazy reason we had this really amazing

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,439
magician and the really cool thing and

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,240
this is not a good magic trick but why I

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,070
think interoperability is especially

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,840
magical why I think this is a very apt

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,990
metaphor is that this is just amazing

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
right it just works and yet you know if

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,100
you really like parse what happens in

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,590
most magic tricks it's just like basic

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,500
sleight of hand and it along with a lot

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,630
of just kind of you know showmanship

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,850
that makes people forget about that

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,710
basic sleight of hand and I feel like a

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,960
lot of technical interoperability is

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,399
also like that where you know there's an

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,210
incredible like all inspiring thing

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,770
about things just working and yet you

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,719
know when you get into the nuts and

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,969
bolts of it it's a lot of just like

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:07,320
sweat going into making that work so

00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:09,300
this is peanut butter and you know

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,860
peanut butter doesn't know anything

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,620
about chocolate right

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,500
and yet you put these two things

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,420
together and it's really exciting so

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,210
this is many of you probably weren't

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,710
around the 80s in the u.s. so that's an

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,660
old ad for a Reese's peanut butter cups

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,280
and the whole point of it is like the

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,720
chocolate goes into the peanut butter

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,390
it's an accident but then people

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,330
discover it actually tastes amazing for

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:38,110
British people you have toast and you

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,640
have Marmite and and apparently I've

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:47,380
heard that if you put these two things

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:49,300
together it's okay yeah yeah I remember

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,900
the first time I saw a British friend

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,640
eating Marmite and I was just I was

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,340
astonished so if the thing is like

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,970
somebody's got to spread the Marmite

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:06,520
right and making the end user the

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:10,240
Interop layer is horrible UX right if we

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:13,240
force the end user to be that layer it's

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,850
just terrible and and so nobody should

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,490
ever fly with me I have a horrible track

00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,800
record with bad luck and mozzie has made

00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,750
it so that nobody can fly with me in the

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,050
company so I was coming out here I was

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,000
supposed to be on Virgin Atlantic and

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,050
and my flight got canceled doesn't

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
really matter I ended up booking

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,320
something on Norwegian and then I had to

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,660
like I bought my ticket through

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Priceline and I'm talking to virgin and

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,760
they wouldn't they wouldn't change my

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,140
ticket and Priceline wouldn't change my

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,180
ticket either because they both need

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,550
each other's permission and I ended up

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,420
half T in JFK like 6:00 in the morning

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:51,910
with no sleep conference call between

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,620
Priceline and Virgin Atlantic for an

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,530
hour and a half walking around the

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,630
airport it was just a horrible

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,120
experience and I realized I this

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,760
epiphany that oh my god they've forced

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,530
me to be the Interop layer I to like go

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,820
back and forth between these two support

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,590
people and get them to talk to each

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,480
other and get them to exchange

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,280
information so they could sort out my

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,750
return ticket which I'm not even sure if

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,040
it's sorted still so I may still be here

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,200
on Monday so when you force end-users to

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,530
do this it's terrible and when you don't

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,650
it's magical so this brings us to web

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,140
intents

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,810
a lot of people probably mean heard of

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,880
this thing so let me go into the history

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,880
of web intents so this was an effort

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,900
that started in 2010 by Paul Kinlan

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:44,120
who's an amazing like guy on the

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,810
chromium team at Google and they you

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,610
know try to create this standard around

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,800
you know interoperability on the dust on

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,020
on the desktop really in the browser

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,120
that mirrored what they were starting to

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,010
do an Android around intents basically

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,780
the they produce some demos but it

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,510
didn't go anywhere and by 2012 they

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:10,190
pulled the code out of Chrome Mozilla

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,320
had made a similar attempt with thing

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,210
called web activities that also is

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,510
dormant I think it's still in like

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:22,940
Mozilla OS but really I I don't know who

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,770
uses Mozilla us so I when we started FTC

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,600
3 I started thinking about web intents

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,110
and kind of going back to that I thought

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,300
about it in a long time and and I really

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,170
wanted to educate myself on like what

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,120
happened there the you know I think

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,490
another important thing just from the

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,650
slides think about how different 2010

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,540
was right like and this is kind of

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,880
startling when you like kind of look

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,990
back to the history like wow in 2010

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,450
like only like it's not even a third of

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,030
people in the US had smartphones I think

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,130
it's this just stats here I mean I don't

00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,900
know all these stats but there's like 15

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,720
percent of people have posted a photo or

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,180
a video online right via their phone I

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,980
mean this is like this stuff didn't

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,810
barely existed right so at the time that

00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,850
people are trying to create this they

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,770
were looking very very far into the

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,080
future and they were thinking about how

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,870
the mobile experience was going to

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,860
evolve and trying to do it on desktop

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:28,160
and this is cool this is from a demo

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,440
that Paul Kinlan and Paul Lewis are both

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,390
on the chromium team did on September

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,400
25th which is incidentally my son's

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,310
birthday in 2012 and I'm not going to

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,110
show you the video these

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,150
just like clips from it the idea here is

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,600
that he has there's this meme generator

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,430
app that's in one browser tab and

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,010
there's a thing where you can click to

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,560
pick an image it fires off a web intent

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,290
and the browser brings up this this

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,690
dialog and asks you Oh what app would

00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,820
you like to use to select an image from

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,830
right and these are all web apps right

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,360
they're just running in browser tabs and

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:10,980
then you pick the whatever the cloud

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:14,010
file picker and then you get a bunch of

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,840
images you select a file it sends it

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:22,860
back to the image generator app and then

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:27,420
you take that and you edit it and you

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,340
select an editing tool and you go to

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,410
that editing tool and then you create

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,540
your meme not very good meme that's

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,000
actually Paul Kinlan there yeah I don't

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,460
think he usually looks like that but and

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,290
then you have your your you know your

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,550
meme created and that's really amazing

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,250
when you think about like that was all

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,870
done in a browser and those three web

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,610
apps didn't know anything about each

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,230
other and they were just following some

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,710
sort of intent standard to make that

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,240
happen like I don't know it makes me

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,290
really excited to think about the web

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,840
working that way and this was done with

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,400
like 30 lines of code in the application

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,980
to make that work so it's like very

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,610
lightweight in terms of the amount that

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,980
an application developer have to do but

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,750
it didn't work right they weren't able

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,950
to get it done and there were a couple

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,540
other attempts there's this thing called

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,980
web wishes which I didn't even know

00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,890
about until I started prepping this talk

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,990
in 2014 that's just kind of sitting

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,180
there as a draft standard fairly very

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,010
similar stuff like I mean it looks

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,020
exactly the same kind of workflow and

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,000
for some reason everybody uses memes for

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,730
the example and you can see outdated

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,650
this is like Friendster or MySpace you

00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,440
know and we're really digging through

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,530
the archives here it's a it's archeology

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,380
and then you know and then you get a

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,420
link etc and this is from 2017 it's the

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,010
last reference I could find from Paul on

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,370
web intents he created this thing called

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,930
comlink it's actually a really cool

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,470
library that is

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,740
I think still active that basically

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,140
creates an RPC interface in front of

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,200
like post message on message post

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,820
message IPC and Chrome so for basically

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,910
trying to like deal with the fact that

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,800
service workers and shared workers are

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,149
really cool but most developers have a

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,610
really hard time working with them

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,560
because it's very hard to like create an

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,060
API on top of that and manage all that

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,670
and so it takes care of cruft for you

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,680
you can see he kind of posted as like I

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,959
got web intents working again and then

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,570
somebody asks him nice or the you are

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,260
the UX problem solved by now and he says

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,660
yeah nope I'm just working out like RPC

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,149
like new UX problems are still there

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,420
right we haven't figured that out we

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:41,070
haven't solved that right and so I

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,580
should have taken this as a warning but

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,700
you know this is an area fraught with

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,440
with peril obviously right it's the

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,510
trying to get the simple magic trick of

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,589
two unrelated things to just work

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:59,220
together is obviously a place of dragons

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:04,050
right so let's look at why did web

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:06,209
intents fail right and for all of you

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,400
involved FTC three we should take a

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:13,290
sobering look at this right so scope

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,870
these are all this is all from Paul

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,209
Kinlan blog about this so these are in

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,880
exactly his words but it really comes

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:25,800
down to there was a an overly broad

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,990
definition of intense so basically they

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,520
just had a very open-ended notion of

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:33,450
intents anybody could create their own

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,310
intent and so it was very very broad and

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,570
people they wanted they kind of

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,570
encouraged people to create lots of

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,850
custom cool intents and they didn't have

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,520
very specific use cases right

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,650
and they really he's looking back he

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,570
said we really need to have those use

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,990
cases defined and we need to have a much

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,700
smaller pool of well-defined intents to

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,770
make this work because it was so broad

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,589
it just becomes a fragmented space and

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,960
in your sort of focus and energy is

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,980
spread out all over the place

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,080
politics right and we have them we have

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,500
them in finance we have an FTC 3 they

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,570
certainly have them on the w3c so as we

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,950
know Mozilla had this other competing

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,170
standard or standard proposal and they

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,980
just couldn't get the two to work

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,670
together and they couldn't find

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,500
consensus of Mozilla the there were a

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,070
lot of things like even the name of

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:35,280
intense of web intents was a sensitive

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,730
topic because it was a very Android

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,270
specific branding and they chose to

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,610
follow the Android API very closely all

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,460
the terminology which you know obviously

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,380
other people in the w3c who didn't like

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,910
weren't pushing Android didn't really

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:57,270
like Google also wanted to create a HTML

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,670
tag from the intent which turned out to

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,280
be a very controversial thing I know

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:05,760
it's like new HTML tag why should it be

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,680
controversial super controversial if you

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,590
look at like things that happened with

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,420
like the web components debate nw3 see a

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,820
lot of that had to do with the semantic

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,840
nature of web google I'm not sure

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,050
there's anybody from Google in the

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,220
audience but so Google you know 90% of

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:25,020
their their revenue is advertising from

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,480
based on the web being semantic so they

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,150
have like a clear commercial stake in

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,340
the web staying semantic and obviously

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,470
be very cool for Google if everybody put

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,450
intent tags in their web apps and Google

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,800
could index all that stuff right so

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,150
there's like a single place where they

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,750
could go and get all this information

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,790
and honestly I think it would be cool to

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,030
but obviously creates a political

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,820
dimension two things that can become

00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:57,030
tricky and then finally the UX which was

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:58,470
a really critical problem so I think it

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,330
really comes down to is that there was

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,190
really no Orchestrator for the UX if

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,020
you're in the mobile space your phone

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,430
becomes the orchestrator for the US when

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,750
you have interoperability between apps

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:13,119
on the desktop this doesn't exist right

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:17,939
you don't have an equivalent thing

00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:20,319
on least on the consumer desktop and

00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:23,409
you're in a browser you're just locked

00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:25,629
into independent tabs so one of the

00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:27,999
problems they the problem he's

00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:31,269
referencing here is just that you know I

00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:32,589
go to my image picker I are select I

00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,809
want to pick an image it opens up the

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,909
image picker app and then I select an

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,979
image but then I close the tab for the

00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:42,159
first app what happens right there's

00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:44,709
nothing controlling orchestrating the UX

00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,259
between these apps are engaged in shop

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:50,199
when you're we're working within the

00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,079
Chrome browser I think it really boils

00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,729
down to one does not simply create

00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,109
interoperability on the desktop right

00:13:54,729 --> 00:14:02,529
sorry I had to do that but you know it's

00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:05,669
it so it is it's a really difficult

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:10,259
thing right this is something where

00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:12,309
Google failed Mozilla failed and

00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,429
probably many others that I'm not even

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,439
aware of have failed at doing this so

00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:22,149
anyway so we threw caution to the wind

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:26,109
and we created FTC 3 which we did what

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:27,759
it was October of 2017 we started I

00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:30,629
think it started with the dinner here in

00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,849
London that I wasn't invited to and then

00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:36,429
when they wanted to do the real work

00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:38,949
they they called me up and and we

00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:42,519
started we had our first meeting in

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:46,239
October of 2017 we got together people

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:50,169
from about 12 firms and then that just

00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:52,779
quickly grew and we contributed into

00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,459
finis I'm blanking on the date but we

00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:59,799
can we contribute everything into finis

00:14:54,459 --> 00:15:03,969
when finis was first formed and in now

00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:06,519
FTC 3 has grown to like 55 plus

00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:08,409
organizations I there's a lot of

00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,179
participants and there's it's a really

00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:12,459
what I love about it's a super

00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:15,059
representative group of people working

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:17,019
on us it's not just one or two

00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:19,149
organizations there's lots of

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,519
representation across the whole

00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:23,209
financial spectrum we have sell side by

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,679
side we have vendors

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:29,300
and and it's very exciting it to me at

00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,490
least it's very exciting I hope it's

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,019
exciting to some of you especially the

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,910
ones that are participating with me in

00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:42,319
this so we wanted to solve this problem

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:45,589
of forcing the end-user to be the

00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:47,689
Interop layer there are lots of problems

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,759
in Interop right there are all sorts of

00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:52,309
different problems that you go after the

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,470
problem the the primary problem that

00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:56,569
we're trying to go after an FDC 3 in my

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,269
opinion the thing that gets me up in the

00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:02,329
morning about this is this forcing the

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:04,040
end-user to be the person that has to

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:07,639
put everything together and make

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,160
everything work because it it creates

00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,709
terrible UX and I believe that it

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,639
creates a huge opportunity cost

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:19,279
so opportunity cost for the end-user and

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,230
also creates opportunity cost for the

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,439
application developers and for the

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,470
people who own these platforms because

00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:30,350
most of these because all Interop is

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,660
possible today right you can create

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,209
everybody's got api's you can make stuff

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,720
work but every single time you have to

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:40,879
do that today it's a one-to-one you know

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,249
negotiation between different

00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,459
development groups and because of that

00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:48,290
cost there's there's just a huge number

00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:51,410
of things that just never happened

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:54,049
because the cost of entry into that

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:58,639
Interop is just too high so if you can

00:16:54,049 --> 00:17:00,949
create a standard way that applications

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,499
once put on a desktop can just do

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,390
reasonable interrupts with each other

00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:09,409
and do things that matter to the

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,419
end-user then you know developers don't

00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,130
have to worry about negotiating with

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,020
every single other group that they might

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,640
want to interact with they can just

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,909
write to a standard and they're done as

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,470
somebody said an event like in New York

00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:24,260
which I thought was amazing he said this

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,059
he said it wasn't somebody I've really

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,039
talked too much about FTC 3 he was just

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,919
demoing what they had done without my

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:33,679
involvement at all no coaching he said

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,690
once you implement FTC 3 the world is

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,450
your oyster and I thought that was very

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,640
nice

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,080
so you know we want this kind of worlds

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,570
which you have on mobile which is that

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,400
you know I just get this intelligent

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:51,990
suggestions about how you know how I can

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:55,710
go from a map to uber or lyft and I can

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:58,290
share something directly into you know

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,110
the communication channel of my choice

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,240
like those things just happen on the

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,770
desktop it's not so great I mean even

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,810
with the new stuff that's coming out

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:11,190
right so this is PWA experience which

00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:14,730
you're slanted in Windows 10 on in in

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,560
Chrome 70 so this is a weird PWA that's

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,810
like an English accents map I don't know

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:26,850
it's just something I chose at random

00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:29,220
and and I'm trying to to tweet this this

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,690
whatever this video right and there's a

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,090
little share thing that comes up and

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,740
it's pretty bad right it's just it's

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,450
obviously just showing me stuff that

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,580
doesn't really relate to what I have

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,790
available it's just the stuff that they

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,460
coded to in their app and when I hit

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,190
Twitter it just opened like a regular

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:52,020
chrome pop-up window that has no

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:55,740
relationship to the PWA and gives me

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,020
this really less than nice UX experience

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,230
here like it just it kind of like pwace

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,420
creating this suspension of disbelief

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,220
that you're running a native app and

00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,100
then as soon as it pops up this ugly

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:12,030
kind of unformatted like chrome pop-up

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:14,010
window to share my tweet it like just

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,640
breaks us suspension and disbelief and

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,560
in the and if I close the PWA the the

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,600
tweet doesn't know that if I close the

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,180
tweet the PWA doesn't know that like

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,150
there's just no orchestration layer at

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,960
all right so this is we want to solve

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,330
this problem right and I think I kind of

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,340
went over she's okay first mistake of

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,810
the day so that's why we were going

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,220
after that's an FTC three creates

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,220
standards around these things I just

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,020
want to acknowledge for a moment all

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,140
these organizations that are probably

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,660
some missing that are involved with FTC

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,010
three and that's is a quite a great list

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,390
if you

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,120
are involved and you don't see your

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,970
organization's logo here please just let

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,760
me know and I apologize

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:05,210
and I also want to like take a moment to

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:12,210
thank everybody participates Leslie and

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:14,640
Jorge Kat Colin yeah Rico Espen Yohan

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:19,020
there's there's a lot and there's many

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:22,500
many of you now and everybody knows has

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:26,520
been supportive in in the past month or

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,900
so we've ratified all the initial 1.0

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,610
standards have all the working groups

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,530
and that means we're gonna enter into an

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,690
exciting time when we can start to

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,700
really go in and implement these things

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,280
and then iterate on those

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,610
implementations and and see how these

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,230
things really work in the wild so this

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,960
is what the working group structure

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,320
looks like for those of you are not too

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,660
familiar there are essentially four

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,960
technical working groups context data

00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:57,270
intense app directory and API and

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,440
there's also a use cases working group

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,540
that's headed up by Kat and Jorge was

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,980
your drive a lot of it along with CRA

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:13,520
patinas and JT Jonathan pepper from JP

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:16,080
Morgan so the the idea here is that we

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,910
have requirements drive the use cases

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,550
working group that informs these other

00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:23,040
technical working groups the API working

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,100
group is really where we sort of tried

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,830
if we created a picture of how all these

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,010
things would come together and that

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,660
boils down to standards that then

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,790
organizations across finance will

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,800
implement and then everything will be

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:42,480
just magical so this is why don't

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,520
looking back at web intents you cannot

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,930
be like oh wow this is really hard a lot

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,750
of really smart people have tried to

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,360
solve this problem and this is why I

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,610
think that things are different this

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,610
time so

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,700
big one is timing right so as I pointed

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,670
out before web intents was very very

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:07,170
early it was it was trying to do stuff

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:11,260
where people didn't even really have the

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:14,470
the structures and the models there so

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:18,040
the underlying technology that this is

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,840
is uh you know resting on is a lot more

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,820
mature today and that's both the web

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,040
technology and I would say the general

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,750
open-source technology not just the

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,340
tooling around open-source but just even

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,440
just the maturity we have around

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,030
open-source and being able to do things

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,420
like finis like could you imagine

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,700
Fitness happening in 2010 or 2012

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,840
I mean people weren't even using web

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:44,380
technology in most this industry and we

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,530
have you know neutral brokers today

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:50,590
right which is really important mutual

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:53,320
brokers like finis and like open fin

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:56,500
that is providing a common base across

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,290
the industry and then also we have

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,570
really strong demand for this within a

00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,280
specific industry and when web intents

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,140
was first launched it was kind of like

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,660
this is a really cool technical thing we

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,520
can do but there was no like there

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,890
weren't real stakeholders and making

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:17,530
that work which is why they were mostly

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:19,870
just doing you know meme creators so the

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,820
second thing is focus right so again

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,790
this goes back to having the industry

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:27,850
specific specificity yeah that's hard

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:30,790
for me to say so having the specifics of

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,610
an industry set of use cases that keeps

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:35,050
that sort of initial set of intents the

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,970
kinds of data structures we're gonna

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,400
have the use cases we're going to want

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,810
to support it keeps us very focused on

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,230
these things and and we have also again

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:49,540
an ecosystem of stakeholders that really

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,570
care about this stuff and have okay it's

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:55,240
actually important for our business you

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:58,420
want to build these things and then

00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:03,010
finally we have technology right we have

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:05,050
a different so what's interesting is

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:08,470
that this is kind of a mix of new and

00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,760
old here so the app model that we are

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,010
used to in fine

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,830
and actually solves the trust problems

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,840
the open web right so a lot of the

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,880
problems that selling like web intents

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,310
faced it's just that in the open web in

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,060
the consumer browser you don't have the

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:27,280
app install experience and and so making

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,040
the orchestration work doesn't really

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,320
make sense in making giving things

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,640
greater access to what they can do on

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,170
the desktop can work you have UX

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,160
Aleutians not available in the browser

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,930
and we also have you know we're creating

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,210
a technology around the the concept of

00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:48,460
federated directories that are gonna

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,200
replace this kind of broad discovery so

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,150
this is another thing we're going back

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,130
to like the intense tag of Google and

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,360
wanting to index the web for intense

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,150
tags

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,520
that's an interesting solution in the

00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,000
open consumer web but that's not what

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,140
people want an enterprise and enterprise

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,850
organizations want to have their own app

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,190
directories or they have all their

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,560
internal apps you know coordinated and

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,240
then maybe they have some things that

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,210
they bring in from third parties so they

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,400
can onboard specifically and maybe they

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,650
have a vendor platform they're working

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,870
with that provides its app directory and

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:26,230
those things can come together but we're

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,310
talking about sort of like archipelagos

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:32,530
of walled gardens right that get

00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:34,240
interconnected in different ways rather

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,130
than just sort of the rough-and-tumble

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,500
open world of the web where like

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:41,080
everything's got to be just like wide

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,600
open and and I think that you can foster

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,920
a lot more within these kinds of like

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,510
collections clusters of app directories

00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,700
so an FDC 3 these things all come

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,250
together into a concept that we call the

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,260
desktop agent which is really

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,790
specifically meant to reference the user

00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,710
agent terminology that's meant to

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,830
describe a browser the idea here is the

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,940
desktop agent is is a higher is another

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:08,320
layer that describes what back in the

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,780
day we would have called a container

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,940
right and this is where we get into the

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,860
mix of old and new right so we're

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,140
basically saying hey we want to redefine

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:21,220
what the financial container looks like

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,700
and it's not you know just something

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,430
we're like

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,410
stuff runs inside of but it has these

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,650
other elements as well and it's built on

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:34,100
open standards and it's built using like

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,530
a kind of web first technology so the

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,130
desktop agent serves as a launcher

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:44,060
renderer and interoperable for apps and

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:47,360
and it's basically it has an app

00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,430
directory it exposes FDC 3 API so the

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,800
apps that run inside of it and it

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:54,110
creates the routing intents and contacts

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,440
data between apps it also provides all

00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,380
that ux orchestration and you'll notice

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,390
so one of the points of this diagram is

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,730
that all the things in white are the

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,470
things we're standardizing an FDC 3 the

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,670
things in grey are things that are left

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:13,640
to implementation so if you know ref

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:15,710
init of wants to build their specific

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,540
flavor of this not to call you guys out

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,040
directly but like you know they they

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,720
have all the power in the world to like

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,640
decide how their UX is going to work

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,500
what kind of capabilities are gonna

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,120
expose to their apps like how their apps

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,950
are gonna leverage all these things they

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,960
can compete on all those things all that

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,090
gets standardized are these basic

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,450
interfaces between things so that we can

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:39,110
all agree on some common like you know

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,610
touch points in the language so this

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,860
again this is trying to strike the

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,410
balance between how organizations can

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,890
build innovative technology that is

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,510
their own special sauce and and how we

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,490
can standardize on the things that

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,550
really should be meat relized so we can

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,530
have those common touch points and this

00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,350
is kind of the model we're going after

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,970
an FDC 3 it's really driven by this

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,340
trend that's been going on for a little

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,230
while which is this digital

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,890
transformation of the financial desktop

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:12,920
from a monolithic structure to something

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,790
where it's it's separate apps that can

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,530
be you know mixed in different ways that

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,260
can give end-users best-of-breed

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,920
solutions and and keep people from being

00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:28,610
locked in to these very you know kind of

00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,190
specific container solutions obviously

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,890
this is something that open fin has a

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,179
lot of interest in it's kind of what we

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:39,269
do it doesn't mean that it

00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,990
that we're the only desktop agent out

00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:45,299
there but this is something that we are

00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,799
have spent a lot of time focused on and

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,789
thinking about and it's one of the

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,649
things that led us to start FDC 3 so in

00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,200
the way that we're trying to envision

00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:57,299
this on our side of how we approach FDC

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,840
3 is that what we're really building is

00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:02,480
a target to you know last year we're

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,789
going to call it just a target for html5

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,869
this year it's a target for pwace how we

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,899
think about it so

00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:11,399
so while chrome keeps moving forward and

00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:14,249
it's solving some of these things with

00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:17,039
PWA on the desktop you still need this

00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:19,259
industry specific orchestration layer to

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,610
create all the other things that you're

00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,730
not going to get in the commercial

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,259
browser and the other thing that we

00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,279
think is critical for doing some of

00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,559
these things that we're talking about

00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,279
FCC 3 and creating these kinds of

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:35,999
standards is to have this kind of common

00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:39,179
distribution right and and today open

00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:42,509
Finny's got over a thousand apps running

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:45,029
on it it's in over 1,500 banks and

00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:47,580
buy-side firms it's in over it's

00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:49,980
deployed in over 60 countries and we're

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,480
approaching 200 thousand desktops that

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:58,799
we are within our ecosystem so this is

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,649
something that is is puts us in a place

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,159
to help really drive a lot of these

00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:06,779
standards and we are working very

00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:11,100
closely with fan-out Sissel

00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:12,659
god made me put this in but no but

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,539
seriously we were working very closely

00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:19,590
with FNS to bring these things together

00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:22,080
in terms of balancing the standards

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:24,299
across the industry with the various

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,509
interest that all the organizations that

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,740
are coming and contributing to this have

00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:32,039
we do you think that the future is

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:36,619
bright and that open fin plus FTC 3 +

00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:38,940
finis creates kind of like a great

00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:43,799
trifecta I think it's the right word is

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:46,139
it to provide governance and technical

00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,539
structure to solve these really very

00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:52,149
real problems of web intents that there

00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:55,960
trying to address back in 2010 back in

00:30:52,149 --> 00:31:01,419
2012 that we can now solve within our

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:03,970
industry so and what we really want to

00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:06,970
do is transform this sad old desktop

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,369
container into something that is as

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:14,830
delightful is chocolate and peanut

00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:16,389
butter and that is the talk thank you

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:56,320
and I can leave some time for questions

00:31:16,389 --> 00:32:05,139
if there are questions yeah Leslie now

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:07,539
and so web intents was sure and

00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:10,479
therefore that's why I think a lot of

00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:13,239
the use cases already exist in financial

00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:15,580
in the financial desktop because we all

00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:17,019
saw with Reuters in the 90s and every

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:20,440
application have rightly what i

00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:47,019
right-clicked the interesting exciting

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:49,210
thing about FTC because I think that's

00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:51,249
an excellent point and and in definitely

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:54,580
I didn't mean to imply that that the

00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:58,840
concept was invented by Google and in

00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,899
2010 the it certainly goes you know way

00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,440
way back and and and actually my first

00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:06,889
encounter of it was

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,679
at Reuters where I worked on 30,000

00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:13,639
extra and and did a lot in terms of the

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:17,149
interoperability there and so so yeah I

00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:18,919
mean that's is absolutely true and and I

00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:21,259
think yeah in finance we have this

00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,720
specific stake in this app to app

00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,970
communication that's a the stakes are

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,889
quite a bit higher in our industry then

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,409
it seems to be in many others but I do

00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:33,350
suspect that there many enterprises

00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:36,919
where this kind of app interoperability

00:33:33,350 --> 00:34:11,720
management is a really key thing any

00:33:36,919 --> 00:34:13,339
other questions that's a good question

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,889
any of the answers just very carefully

00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:19,730
and that's what we've been trying to do

00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:22,520
right as I'm sure you and many others

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:25,700
here know it's a constant balancing act

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,329
between not getting too far ahead of

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:31,970
ourselves in terms of what we can where

00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:34,429
we can build consensus but also the

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,679
pressure to define things one that we

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,770
have I mean this is not greenfield they

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,409
there are existing long existing systems

00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,790
that are running with many variations of

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:48,409
these kinds of things today so I think

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:53,629
for me the important thing is the

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:55,339
distinction between that you know FTC 3

00:34:53,629 --> 00:35:01,550
I think it's important to remember isn't

00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:04,010
trying to be all encompassing so not

00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,960
just because something is not yet to

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:09,050
find in FTC 3 doesn't mean that you

00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,390
can't do it according to FTC's repin Yin

00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:16,740
it just means we haven't standardized it

00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:18,420
yet so so everyone should

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,950
keep that in mind as they're looking at

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,480
this that we're just trying to find

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,220
those critical touch points and

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,750
prioritize them yes

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:42,060
I'm sorry I think James you had your

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:44,250
hand up first name yeah so in that's

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,680
yeah so when you have multiple desktop

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,380
agents or platforms we call them is we

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:53,460
might call them that's something that we

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,770
are talking about within FTC 3 we have

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,460
not yet put forth the standard about it

00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:02,430
the the we wanted to get the language

00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,710
the basic like building blocks to the

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:08,340
languages around context data intense

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,260
especially locked down first before we

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,780
went to that I think even just having

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:17,369
those building blocks goes a long way in

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:19,920
being able to have different platforms

00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:21,930
talk to each other because now like if I

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,630
say to icon oh I want to view a chart

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,030
you'll actually understand what I'm

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:31,880
asking for and I won't have to know the

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,880
specific icon word for that right now

00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,830
there's a lot of interesting technical

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,840
things to start working out around how

00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,490
platforms interconnect right because

00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,640
most of them I think a lot of them today

00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,920
are going to be using local WebSocket so

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,710
now we've got to like figure out how we

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,580
do port discovery and then you get into

00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:56,310
how do we you know authenticate that or

00:36:53,580 --> 00:37:02,040
verify that this thing that says it's

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:03,750
Auto Bahn is in fact Auto Bahn right so

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,460
there's their number of like really deep

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,710
issues to work through there we're

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,260
definitely interested in getting to that

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,080
work of figuring that out but a lot of

00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,250
its just coming getting the right people

00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,230
at the table come to the right

00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,350
agreements and getting those platforms

00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:22,640
then to implement those standards right

00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm sure John

00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:51,050
yeah yeah yeah so that's that's a really

00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,250
good point

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:58,130
so yeah are we just moving the problem

00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,950
from one place to another and you know

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:04,150
you could that's an age-old problem in

00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:07,010
trying to solve these things the the

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:11,120
because I'm actually older than I look

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:14,240
Leslie but the so the the the way I

00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,950
think about that is that if there is a

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,310
recognized standard that can get a

00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:22,520
critical mass then there will be an

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,710
incentive for application providers and

00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,360
platform providers to start to build

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,370
that standard because they will be able

00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,000
to create a better experience for their

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:33,860
end users and that point it just becomes

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,650
competition in the marketplace right so

00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,750
if you decide you know what I'm not

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:42,470
going to bother you know implementing

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,030
this standard and because I've got my

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,790
own way of doing it or because I don't

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:50,090
think it's important or whatever it is

00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:51,740
and and you force developers could still

00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,640
connect to your platform these have to

00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:58,370
use your your system right to do so

00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,870
you're not actually necessarily blocking

00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,490
anybody off you're just people that have

00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,650
to continue what they do today which is

00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,780
figure out what your api's are and

00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,580
figure out when your API is change how

00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,540
they have to update their code and go

00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:13,400
through that cycle constantly so if if

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,300
you're you know if you choose to do that

00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,360
it may be fine but it may be that

00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:22,610
eventually fewer platforms want to

00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,230
integrate with you or fewer applications

00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,700
will want to you because it's it's a lot

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,550
of work for them and maybe there's a

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,530
critical mass of others who are

00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,850
providing a great experience without

00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,100
them having to go through additional

00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,750
work I think it's going to take time for

00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,549
that to play out but that's what I would

00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,150
hope would happen

00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:43,689
yeah the church top agent is not part of

00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,880
the FTC 3 it's an implementation

00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:47,199
strategy and we've proposed a different

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,390
one that absolutely addresses the

00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,390
question they're talking about but the

00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:58,150
biddings provides a language and an API

00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,549
having context whatever the

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,119
implementation strategy is yeah it all

00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:05,920
stays the same

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,509
I think it's been yeah absolutely I

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,249
think that's a good distinction it's

00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:11,469
there's a nuance but yeah the desktop

00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:14,949
agent is a concept

00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:18,400
there's no desktop agent standard in FTC

00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:21,339
3 it's now it's not required it's it's

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,529
it's mentioned as a concept in the API

00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:26,679
standard but it's it's not like there's

00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:30,130
a requirement for it yet sorry was that

00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:33,069

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:36,849
