Title: Common Open Source Intake Issues and How to Resolve Them - Jeff Luszcz Day 1 OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management, Flexera Software
Presentation: Common Open Source Intake Issues and How to Resolve Them

In this talk Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management at Flexera, explores the lessons learned over years of experience with Open Source consumption, the most common compliance and security issues, reasons for software component rejection, and tips and tricks for improving your compliance efforts. It is becoming common for open source compliance reviews to be performed both when a component is being first selected, or later on after the component has already been integrated into a system. This presentation will detail the most common reasons why an open source software component would be rejected for use or would be removed from an existing system due to compliance or security reasons. This talk will include a checklist of the most common compliance review failures as well as the differences in expectations between the creators of open source packages and their users. Common remediation tasks, go-no tests and documentation expectations will be discussed. The talk is for anyone involved with ensuring open source license compliance.

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,349
as we get everything all working here so

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,580
thanks again for joining we're gonna go

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,600
till about ten ten today so a relatively

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,730
quickly I'm also going to give a more

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
expanded version of this tomorrow as

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,310
well so if you're here tomorrow come on

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,460
join us and we can have some deeper dive

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,349
my name is Jeff lush I am the founder of

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,079
Palomita about fifteen years ago started

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,690
a company that was designed to basically

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,100
discover and manage both open source and

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,590
commercial software libraries so I've

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,180
been working with large companies small

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,329
companies open source software companies

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,180
for 15 years discovering and managing

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,590
licence problems and security problems

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,949
so what we're going to talk about today

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,899
is common intake issues and how to

00:00:52,949 --> 00:01:00,329
resolve them so we'll go through what is

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,969
open source intake what are some intake

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,390
flows what are some of the problems in

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:11,520
the current process major issues

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,049
vulnerabilities and compliance issues so

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,500
the first thing is what is open source

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,659
intake basically this is the process of

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,520
obtaining open source or third-party

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,860
software and bringing it into the

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,290
application that you're building it

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,479
could be source code it could be binary

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,060
form it could be an external resource

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,500
give me an image an icon anything else

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,840
that you didn't write the process could

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,110
be ad hoc meaning your developers just

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,020
do whatever they want to do we can have

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,979
a very monitor process so we'll talk

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,979
about the specifics today

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,340
so what are your common flows well the

00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,400
old-school way is to have a developer

00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,560
actually make a request before usage so

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,680
maybe a question here who here currently

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,150
has any sort of intake flow process okay

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,210
and are you currently making your

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,649
developers make requests beforehand okay

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,640
anybody who just does it after the fact

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:15,370
okay this is this is the traditional way

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,380
this is where legal team sat down and

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,450
said we need to look at every single

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,430
library before it comes in and we want

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,450
to look and learn what it is and then

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,269
we're gonna give a thumbs up or a thumbs

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,580
down before we let you use it that is

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,370
the traditional way of managing open

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,200
source I think as time goes on we're

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,209
gonna see that that is used less and

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,910
less for the typical software package

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:39,390
but only for really specific and and and

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,410
troublesome or hard to manage projects

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,269
one of the things that we see is there's

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,830
literally hundreds to thousands of

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,989
open-source libraries that are being

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,760
used every day in a typical product and

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,790
that kind of breaks down when you try to

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,690
have a lawyer look at each and sing each

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,019
individual library before it's brought

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,610
in so what what also happens well the

00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,549
most common thing is a developer -

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,320
selects a library a component brings it

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,480
into the codebase and says I'm gonna use

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,010
this maybe they ask permission maybe

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,600
they tell somebody maybe they don't but

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,070
that's what's happening every - as we're

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,930
sitting here right now developers are

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,250
coming into their offices and they're

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,660
going out to the Internet and they're

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,910
downloading open-source they're

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,370
downloading commercial SDKs and it's now

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,110
suddenly part of your product the other

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,120
thing that happens when your developers

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,340
do that is they bring in that library

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,590
but they also bring in all the other

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,019
libraries that that component depends on

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,000
so kind of the sub component problem and

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,950
so you're required to manage all those

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,720
licenses and all those compliance issues

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,370
and security issues as well when you

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,040
bring in that choice and that kind of

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,290
calls causes a fan-out problem you bring

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,329
in one item what we see the typical

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,459
library brings in about seven to eight

00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,880
other sub components when you bring it

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:51,310
in okay you might be using a repository

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,130
manager like maven and so when you do

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,560
that it kind of hides a lot of the sub

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,060
component usage behind the scenes your

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,110
developers pick something almost from a

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,610
venue and says I want to use this

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,080
and then everything else happens behind

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,030
the scenes it may be doing automatic

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,710
upgrades for you it may be bringing in

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,530
the the sub components and dependencies

00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,150
for you and next thing you know at build

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,160
time these items are being brought in

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,990
you might not see it in your source code

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,640
management system but you you your

00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,130
product will end up using it at Build

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,080
time the repository manager brings in

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,060
those dependencies as well you also can

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,570
bring in your commercial SDKs this is

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,730
maybe becoming less and less as a thing

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,800
as we use more and more open-source

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,500
dependencies but especially in certain

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,390
industries IOT healthcare automotive

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,850
you're gonna see a strong dependence on

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,990
commercial SDKs and all the open source

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,880
that are then brought in by those

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,830
components as well and then you're also

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,510
going to see the IT infrastructure so

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,880
your developers are gonna be picking

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,530
certain open source libraries and your

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,180
IT teams are going to be picking

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,440
infrastructure we're gonna use Amazon

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,360
we're gonna use Google we're gonna use

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,610
XYZ or we're gonna use this database

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,650
we're gonna use these queues or whatever

00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,030
it may be all of these things are the

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,140
ways that open source and other

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,370
commercial code ends up in your product

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,110
so what are some of the problems well

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,440
the first thing is nobody really knows

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,550
what you're using I find that over the

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,810
last 15 years I've worked with

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,220
organizations and the first thing that

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,870
we do when we come in as we say let's

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,270
get your bill of materials together and

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,130
what that means just like in a car what

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,080
are the screws and bolts and wires that

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,580
go into your product what is the

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,960
software packages what is the source

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,669
code where the binder is a go into your

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,130
product that at the heart of open source

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:30,410
compliance is that process figuring out

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,990
your basically your bill of materials

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,040
and most companies can't produce a bill

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,840
of materials and we'll talk a little bit

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,580
about how that how that comes up but

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,320
basically if you go back tomorrow and

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,150
say can can we get a list of all the

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,880
open source that we use most companies

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,290
can't get a list or if they do it's

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,790
never been examined it's never really

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,130
been looked at so that's at the heart of

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,510
it that's our job number one number two

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,310
is there's there's really lack of

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,390
controls and no ownership if you go

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,830
again and go back to your company say

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,620
who's responsible for open source

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,940
there's a lot of so and so is someone so

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,800
is or well they are but they actually

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,830
never get asked questions so on so so

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,720
that's that's a problem there's a lack

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,400
of institutional knowledge I get called

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,090
all the time when people say what do we

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,890
do about GPL with classpath exception or

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,730
what about this license versus that

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,290
license

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,490
and there might be one or two people in

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,200
the company that has that type of

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,700
knowledge to make those decisions maybe

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,620
it's your open source review board maybe

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,560
it's your legal team maybe it's a really

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,270
dedicated engineer but in terms of

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,280
managing this we very often have these

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,630
these islands of knowledge but then

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,030
everybody else making decisions without

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,620
that without that knowledge we're gonna

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,390
have open source compliance failures

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,980
that means you ship a product but you're

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,810
not following all the obligations of the

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,220
open source you're using you have

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,630
software vulnerabilities we all saw what

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,160
happened with Equifax last year that

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,110
we're gonna hear that comment over and

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,150
over again today but really a lot of

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,710
people have woken up to managing their

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,670
open-source Manning in the third-party

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,590
dependencies with security in mind and

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,870
then lastly we don't see it as much as

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,610
much these days but export control

00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,780
issues again as a side effect of not

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,940
managing your open source and

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,500
third-party meaning you may have certain

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,540
government regulations around the use of

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,860
cryptography that you need to manage as

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,950
if you export something from your

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,540
company and from your country so let's

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,160
talk first about vulnerabilities I'm

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,250
going to go through a few very specific

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,140
intake issues and that have caused

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,400
problems when people are trying to get

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,150
their product out the door or they're

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,830
trying to emerge or an acquisition

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,290
they're trying to release a product as

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,610
open-source itself the first one that's

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,180
on everybody's mind right now is around

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,460
vulnerabilities I think it's pretty you

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,410
know everybody knows the Equifax story

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,700
everybody knows what's what's going on

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,930
in the world around managing these

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,750
vulnerabilities but at the heart of it

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,730
we use these third-party libraries they

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,590
get brought in to solve a problem and

00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,000
then we leave them in the codebase

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,950
without updating or upgrading them

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,180
that's that leads to potentially

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,850
software bugs that can lead to

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,500
vulnerabilities the most common intake

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,480
issue here is that somebody picks a

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,760
library they don't know that the

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,200
vulnerability exists and you keep

00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,540
shipping your product that may have that

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,310
vulnerability or you have a

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,720
software-as-a-service site up that may

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,800
be affected maybe it's the struts

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,570
vulnerability like that that affected a

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,670
equifax or maybe open SSL heartbleed you

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,410
know from a couple years ago the most

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,720
common fix to this is just doing a

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,690
simple upgrade there was a a bug that

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,890
was discovered most people to say

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,540
upgrade to the latest release that's

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,450
that is probably 80 90 percent of the

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,190
the fixes the most most intake issues

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,450
around vulnerabilities that's pretty

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,199
straightforward your developers are

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,300
doing that each and every

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,519
the thing that we need to may need to

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,240
pay attention to is has the license

00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,310
changed has the is there a compatibility

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,000
issue so sometimes people just will say

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,010
willy-nilly

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,479
oh just upgrade everything but you move

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,640
from version two of something to version

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,420
eight of something is the API is not

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
going to be the same

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,589
maybe the license changed between those

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,820
two so as managers of open-source

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,079
wanting to make sure that we're doing

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,730
the right thing around compliance and

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:55,500
security we need to pay attention to

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,240
that we also need to have our developers

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
understand that just doing a simple

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,779
upgrade we need to pay attention to the

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,220
licensing issues and the compatibility

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,839
issues and it's not something that

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,420
typically gonna do at the last minute

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,370
there's a lot of burnin tests and makin

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,430
tests that are required to preserve the

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,589
compatibility a side of things you also

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,540
may be able to do things that don't

00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,089
require a code change maybe its firewall

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,700
changes maybe it's simply upgrading the

00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,079
the password that was the default

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,790
password was the vulnerability you

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,019
changed the password those are the six

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,480
of things that you want to ask your

00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,550
developers how do we fix this issue do

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,010
we fix it by upgrading it do we fix it

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,810
by doing IT issues and what is the side

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,360
effects of upgrading it I think the vast

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,220
majority of issues here are going to be

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,950
relatively straight for upgrade your

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,440
version just may make some subtle checks

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:47,459
around a compatibility in the licensing

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,380
and away you go what's what's you know

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,089
what's the problem here is we still

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,040
don't see people doing the the upgrades

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,540
that they need to do especially want to

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,709
involves a software supply chain and

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,750
I'll talk about that a little bit a

00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,250
little bit but one of the things that we

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,589
think is very important if you if you

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,339
don't know these open-source libraries

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,690
and if you don't know these

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,209
vulnerabilities like the back of your

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,220
hand it's something that I would

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:10,079
recommend picking at least a couple of

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,029
these and using these as your tests when

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,579
you go talk to your developers are we

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:17,850
using open SSL are we using struts are

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:19,920
we using G Lib C are we using bash this

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,180
kind of hits the the different types of

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,310
software that we're shipping are we

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,050
shipping Java software we should think

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,640
something this may be embedded do we

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,339
have a container or an operating system

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,649
and these are great bellwethers if you

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,670
get these right it's not it's not a sign

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,810
that you're doing everything right but

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,940
it's a pretty good sign if you get these

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,490
wrong there so they're typically so

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,290
obvious that if you got them wrong all

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,430
the other less obvious stuff is probably

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,630
being handed

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,630
and correctly as well so these are great

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,990
tests I see in our work that most people

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,640
have multiple year old versions of these

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,560
including OpenSSL so it got fixed back

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,089
in 2014 when everybody did their work

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,490
around our fleet and hasn't been touched

00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,779
since for many organizations there's

00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,820
been vulnerabilities every six weeks

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:04,020
every three months it's it's a great

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,190
test for your internal processes one of

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,959
the changes I've seen in the last year

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,089
is that customers are starting to check

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,560
themselves they get your code they get

00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,330
your product or they take a look at

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,250
what's out there on the website and they

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,570
run it through various scanner tools or

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,700
they're gonna ask you questions about

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,440
your inventory or bill of materials and

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,730
they're going to put tests to you what's

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,620
version of struts do you use what

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,240
version of OpenSSL do you use or here's

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,370
a laundry list of problems that we found

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,550
in your product that we want you to go

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,980
fix even if you're not affected by that

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,149
vulnerability you may be asked to fix it

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,290
and it's a very common thing you hear

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,360
you'll hear from your developers

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,310
developers just say yeah yeah we were

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,470
aware of that vulnerability but it

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,120
doesn't affect us but you then now have

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,100
to go talk to your customers and say yes

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,020
we understand that we we guess we use

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,400
that library yes we use that version but

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,650
we're not affected by the vulnerability

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,270
and that really is a big trust issue and

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:55,200
a lot of times it's true

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,490
yeah we're not affected trust us more

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,170
often not I think what you're gonna find

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,060
is company your customers are gonna say

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,680
well that's great but we just want to

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,940
see this go away we want to strike

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,310
everything that's on this read list

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,870
please get rid of it so I'm seeing that

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,029
that pressure coming from the customers

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,080
more and more I also see the developers

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,900
pushing back and saying we're not

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,180
affected but this getting overruled by

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,670
sales and marketing when it comes to

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,990
just cleaning out that list the other

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,490
thing that's surprising to some people

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,350
is when you when you do this intake

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,360
process your developers say I want to

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,709
use this library of this version and you

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,450
check to make sure that doesn't have any

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,640
vulnerabilities in it you get a clean

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,579
bill of health you then are using it for

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,560
one one month one year or two years it

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,810
ages out people find vulnerabilities in

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,790
that version and you then out have to

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,320
pay attention and fix that a lot of

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,000
companies are just paying to the pay

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,500
attention to the top of tree they're

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,420
saying as things get requested by

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,770
developers we'll do the test but they're

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,140
not checking to see what's as part of

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,850
your installed base or deployed

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,230
application and this is where people

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,339
sometimes will get embarrassed because

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,930
their head of tree is clean but

00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,430
their customers are scanning what's

00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,779
actually on their hard drives or when

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,850
they're installed on their systems and

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,379
they're seeing six-month-old problems or

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,779
a year old or two-year old problems so

00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:06,639
be ready for that it also comes in

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,730
through your support list you'll

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,230
actually have your support team getting

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,389
requests for vulnerability management

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,519
from the field and they very often are

00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,959
this is unexpected request to them they

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,749
know how to handle I can't print

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,089
I can't login they don't often know who

00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:24,160
to go contact around vulnerability

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,259
issues or perceived vulnerability issues

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,519
so something they go take a look on with

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,589
your support team how would they handle

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,559
this do they know who to contact in your

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:36,790
company and you have a canned response

00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:39,160
around managing this the next thing is

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,230
around the supply chain there are very

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,699
few companies that just build their

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,699
products just based on things that your

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,499
developers decide to use that's small

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,300
companies maybe small libraries

00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,860
themselves but most companies are

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,779
finding themselves involved in a very

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,730
long supply chain and what the software

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,160
supply chain is is anybody who builds

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,410
software that you use maybe it's wrapped

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,149
in some functionality maybe it's wrapped

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,769
in a commercial wrapper and then it's

00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,660
passed on from from company to company

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,389
or organization organization until

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,679
finally your team brings it in and the

00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,120
supply chain is getting longer and

00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,319
longer and if you're in certain

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,870
industries if you're in the automotive

00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:17,019
industry healthcare IOT you have an

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,490
extremely long supply chain if you're in

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,980
the financial industries you have a

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,509
supply chain as well we're hearing from

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,490
the you know some of the suppliers today

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,620
about here's a commercial company it

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,360
comes into this organization it then

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,429
gets wrapped and put on github your

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,620
developers then pick it and use it and

00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:34,509
so on and so on and this is a great

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,189
thing it's basically showing the

00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:39,189
community around us it's showing many

00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:41,199
hands help us but but your supply chain

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:43,029
doesn't always have your best interest

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,100
at heart or your supply chain may not

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,389
care about what your business model is

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,220
or what your problems are where your

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,660
costs from requests are they're building

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,490
open source they're building commercial

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,639
code and especially if there are three

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,370
levels down in your supply chain a

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,999
panicked phone call if on Friday at five

00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,709
o'clock

00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,809
isn't really gonna make them jump in and

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,579
help you you you need to understand

00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,049
where your dependencies are you need to

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,850
understand how you work with them how do

00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:07,990
you contact with them and the types of

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,970
issues that may come up

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,430
and so the intake issues we see around

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,630
the supply chain is number one is you

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,180
need to understand who your supply chain

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,730
is and understand the further you go

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,860
back the less likely they are able to

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,680
help you they may not there may be

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,170
language issues there may be contractual

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,820
issues there may be just you know hey

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,950
that's I'm sorry you have a problem but

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,450
I'm an open source developer I don't

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,310
know how to fix your issue or I don't I

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,900
don't have to answer your export control

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,700
questionnaire and I'm not going to fill

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,710
in your RFP for you these are the types

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,300
of things that we hear when companies

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,030
try to push some of this compliance

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,430
tasks their supply chain what's

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,830
currently not happening the the software

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,260
supply chain is not giving the bill of

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,670
materials and proper disclosures to the

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,090
companies who are depending on them so

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,070
again if you go and bring in an SDK or

00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,810
open source library you say where's the

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,180
open source disclosures you know maybe

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,490
an SPD X file maybe a license notices

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,290
file many of those projects still are

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,480
not providing that information to you as

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,660
a user they should and this is where

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,090
your organization can kind of push back

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,250
on the supply chain and say you know we

00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,810
really need your open source disclosures

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,520
to be correct we need your

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,350
vulnerabilities to be checked whether

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,180
it's on a commercial you the supplier

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,590
whether it's an open source supplier if

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,020
you can build that as part of your and

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,390
take issue an intake process it's a lot

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,860
easier for you when you have a problem

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,450
to look at your list and say oh we're

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,860
good we have a bill of materials for

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,480
this organization we have we know that

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,830
these people are doing won't ability

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,840
scanning or vulnerability management

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,910
these are not we need to take care of

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,110
this ourselves

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,000
but put the pressure on that and and

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,800
what I like to try to what I try to say

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,750
here is make this more of a push not a

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,550
pull process right now it's a pull

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,380
process we can we go yell at our

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,640
commercial suppliers we will yell at our

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,380
open-source suppliers and say I need

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,180
this you need to give this to me we

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,710
really want that to be a push process

00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,970
where they're pushing the bill of

00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,730
materials to you they're pushing the

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,690
compliance documents they're pushing

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,580
vulnerability updates to you so you just

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,250
are waiting for the proper things to

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,020
happen test the supply chain I showed

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,240
that list of well-known vulnerabilities

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,830
before those are great tests whether

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,360
from a compliance perspective of

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,860
vulnerability perspective if they're

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,910
getting those wrong they're gonna get

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,339
everything else wrong and these are

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,780
great tests and but you are responsible

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,890
for what you deliver so if you're

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,740
shipping a product if you're

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,410
distributing some

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,720
you know the buck stops with you you

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,660
can't we see a lot of company say oh our

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,010
supplier caused that problem legally and

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,050
probably from your customers as well

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,450
they don't care about that you picked a

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,950
supplier for four company's ago on the

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,260
supply chain and they're giving you a

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,360
GPL violation or a struts problem

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,130
they're looking you say we want your

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,350
processes correct we want you you're

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,030
responsible we paid you for this product

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,730
or we're depending on you data to fix

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,290
this for us the supply chain is one of

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,540
the things I think you need to have your

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,940
security team your sales team your

00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,429
marketing team your legal team all

00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,690
singing the same song this is something

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,000
that's going to affect your contracts

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,520
it's going to affect how you reach out

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,020
of the organization and it can take a

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,240
little while there's some talks around

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,550
the open chain process which I'd

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,270
recommend taking a look at today or

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,650
tomorrow

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,300
that's a there's some great

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,890
documentation and processes there around

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,450
how you work with your with your supply

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,450
chain and you can be a good member of

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,950
your supply chain as well one other

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,309
things I always like to mention in these

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,780
talks is around education and process

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:28,460
every day and we may be a little biased

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,679
here if you've come to a talk around

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,970
open source compliance and security

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,700
that's the companies who say yes we have

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,170
great process we have great education

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,210
most people are not in this talk or the

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,160
other talks today they don't have great

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,470
education if you go to the typical line

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,679
level developer and ask them specific

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,110
questions about open source licensing

00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,520
security etc you may be shocked just by

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,230
you know they're great Java developers

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,730
they're great JavaScript developers they

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,230
don't understand the intake issues they

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,480
don't understand the license issues and

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,410
if they did get trained on it it was one

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,090
of the same time they're doing the

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,110
retirement benefits their healthcare

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,850
benefits and it was just another

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,730
training they click Next Next Next Next

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,870
on they passed it and they moved on this

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,570
is something I don't think you can do

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,160
enough training around open source the

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,630
the universities are currently not doing

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,910
enough on this I think companies are not

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,610
doing enough about this and it's it only

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,940
you know a little ounce of prevention

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,140
fixes a big remediation problem later on

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,870
management and legal often comes in too

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,820
late to really add a lot of help here

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,500
you know it's an emergency somebody says

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,000
oh we're supposed to we're selling this

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,960
we designed a contract that says we're

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,470
going to give a list of all our

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,000
open-source disclosures to a company

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,240
and it's supposed to be done in Tuesday

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,049
it's Monday and legal gets brought in

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,820
because there's no there's no

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,140
documentation there's no process and

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,669
when they do it they find a bunch of

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,830
vulnerability so they find a bunch of

00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:48,140
licensing problems and now in there in

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,480
this case where we contractually we have

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,760
to deliver this list of disclosures but

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,470
management is saying you told me 24

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,059
hours before is do not a weed now what

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,280
do we do and this leads to the ethical

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:01,039
problems this leads to kind of customer

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,750
happiness issues so again educate your

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,760
developers educate your legal team your

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,110
security teams your sales team about how

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,700
long it takes to do these things and

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,380
what can we do to make this process a

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,260
little better and you're also going to

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,270
find that these processes are sometimes

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,340
kept secret hey we have a general we

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,309
have a GPL violation an open source

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,360
violation we have a security problem

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,650
those things are often hidden away

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,059
because you don't want to scare your

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,370
customers you don't want to scare your

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:27,830
developers or maybe there's a perceived

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,090
legal privilege thing and so it makes it

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,530
harder for everybody in the company

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,880
understand how do we fix these things

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,559
how do we deal with these things and I

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,710
think the more we can talk about this

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,510
the more we can educate our developers

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,020
the better that and easier this process

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,580
gets so let's talk some specific things

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,780
you guys are gonna go back to your

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,710
companies you're gonna start looking at

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,720
your bill of materials you're gonna

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,120
start looking at your your vulnerability

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,720
lists and some things are pretty

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,730
straightforward

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,120
what do we do we we remove something we

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,760
upgrade something we kill a feature

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,020
those are the most common things

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,600
remediation or fixes that you're going

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,340
to see to open source intakes issues or

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,809
vulnerabilities just remove the feature

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,150
delete the delete that part of the

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,610
product that that's the pretty

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,049
straightforward thing there's some

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,640
things a lot harder this is the I'm

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,260
gonna go through about five or six of

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,450
the issues that I found have really

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,760
stopped merger and acquisitions release

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,200
software shipments and delivery and also

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
have has caused problems with the sales

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,289
process so probably the one of the

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,350
biggest issues that we hear see here is

00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,809
around GPL violations or or using

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,640
copyleft these strong licenses that

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,370
basically say if you're shipping a

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,960
product and you're using content under

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,789
these open-source licenses the

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,950
expectation is you're going to give away

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,929
the source code to the product anything

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,970
that links to it and that's that it's a

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:46,100
great license it's what is underneath

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,210
the linux kernel a lot of the tools that

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,600
we use in the linux you

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:53,390
run-time at the heart of every a car is

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,240
a hundred million lines of GPL source

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,530
code but many of us are working at

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,770
commercial companies who want to keep

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,510
things closed and proprietary and these

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,580
licenses might be in conflict with that

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,930
business model and so what you're going

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,940
to find is your developers if they don't

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,170
understand what the what the licenses

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,580
mean they're gonna make the right

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,040
technical choice they're gonna pick a

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,990
library that fixes their technical

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,200
problem but it might have a license

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,760
that's contrary to your policy so look

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,990
the most common thing we're gonna see

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,850
here is you're going to say we can't use

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:27,290
this library anymore we need to we need

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,850
to remove it we need to basically build

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,770
this feature again that's the most

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,390
common response I'll say one of the

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,100
things I've seen is that there are some

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,800
things that you can do if you have a

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,120
little bit of time if if you've signed a

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,710
contract and you have to fix this thing

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,890
in a week you're probably gonna go the

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,810
route of delete and rewrite but you have

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,820
a couple other options so some of these

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,680
licenses actually have a commercial

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,120
alternative you can go talk to the

00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,680
original author and say I'd like to buy

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,110
a commercial license is that possible

00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,360
that that can happen in some cases but

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,580
not in not in all for example you can't

00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,900
go to the Linux kernel community and say

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,760
I want to buy a commercial license this

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,270
is not physically possible to have done

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,040
their licensing for single proprietor

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,450
single authors small organizations and

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,880
made an open-source organization it may

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,470
be possible maybe you just open-source

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,490
your product maybe this is something you

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,090
say we don't need to keep this thing

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,890
closed

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,240
let's open source it we're gonna get

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,650
some great value from being an open

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,360
source company especially if it's just

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,610
part of your your core infrastructure

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,520
it's not seen as having a lot of trade

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,680
secrets and things like that you may

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,350
your developers may say I can rebuild

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,720
this I can I can rewrite this I want to

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,060
be caution you on that I have not seen a

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,160
lot of great clean room development in a

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,830
rush so somebody says we have this GPL

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,090
library trust me I can fix it and you

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,440
get back something that looks just like

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,730
that original library but they stripped

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,080
the copyrights they've changed some of

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,100
the variable names and things like that

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,510
so you want to make sure you don't do

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,160
dirty room development you want to do

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,230
clean room development if you do a

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,450
rewrite and and I would say in most

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,640
cases rewriting is not a great solution

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,200
except for some pretty small routines

00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,250
here and there

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,990
GPL issues are probably

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,060
if you're not shipping software you may

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,320
not be concerned as much about this but

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,880
I also see that more more people are

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,430
starting to build containers and they're

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,660
starting to build not just SAS products

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,160
but they're gonna deliver things in

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,630
containers just like we used to do with

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,640
virtual machines or real machines and

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,310
the GPL issues are starting to come back

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,510
you know we did SAS for a while we're

00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,220
now starting to see people wanting to

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,250
distribute more things in containers and

00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,450
give it for on-premises and that's a

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,050
classic distribution we have to pay

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,760
attention of the GPL issues in where you

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,250
are in the stack is also very important

00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,140
if you're building an IOT system you're

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,850
building a container system you're gonna

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,050
have your operating system your kernel

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,270
and things like that it's all going to

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,430
be GPL perfect that's exactly what we're

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,160
looking for as you get to your your your

00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,080
proprietary product at the top you want

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,130
less and probably less and less GPL up

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,040
there if you're gonna keep things closed

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,510
source so one thing I've seen with

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,640
intake issues is some companies say no

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,230
GPL allowed whatsoever then you have

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,550
your developers trying to figure out how

00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,770
they're supposed to actually release

00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,850
their containers or the operating

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,610
systems and things like that so you

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,530
can't just have a simplistic no GPL

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,480
policy you need to have a policy that

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,010
reflects reality you also will find

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,140
sometimes that people here that you're

00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,280
allowed to use GPL down here and they

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,320
think that they're allowed to use it up

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,820
in the proprietary piece again this is

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,900
where these intake issues come out so

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,550
you need to talk not just about

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,820
licensing you need to talk about how

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,650
that product is used the thing that's

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,840
closely related to this is around dual

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,970
licensing so many of the libraries that

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,120
are out there give you a choice of

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,220
license I can use maybe a GPL license or

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,080
maybe a separate type of license and

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,180
there's really two cases that we see out

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,980
there one is around business models

00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,410
somebody says I want to make money using

00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,690
my open-source so I put it out there

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,640
under a GPL license but I also give you

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,370
an option of buying a commercial license

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,140
my sequel I text these are two very

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,910
common libraries that you're gonna see

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,550
out there that your developers are just

00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,740
gonna download it's open source it's

00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,970
freely available it's under by default

00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,920
it's under a general public license

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,000
which has all the concerns that we

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,100
talked about in the last set of slides

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,200
if you're gonna end up distributing this

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,850
you can purchase a commercial license as

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,170
part of their business model and then

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,250
it's just another piece of commercial

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,390
license software for you what happens a

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,930
lot of times you find about this after

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,980
the fact

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,900
you've already been shipping something

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,120
and you have to then pay for things that

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,860
may be in the field what do you do you

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,240
can purchase a commercial license you

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,100
can release the product as open source

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,900
which is less likely or you can remove

00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,120
the component and maybe find something

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,670
else that provides a work like

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,450
functionality under a different license

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,400
you will you will find this

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,700
traditionally around databases you'll

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,320
find this around maybe some of the other

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,730
parts of your infrastructure but in

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,350
general whenever you see that you're

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,810
using a database first question you

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,970
should be asking what you know is this a

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,740
dual license database this is MongoDB my

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,150
sequel Berkeley DB these are all

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,070
companies have been wrapped around this

00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:54,640
and they've built a licensing model on

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,810
that another dual license that you're

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,470
also going to see especially in the Java

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,910
community is where they're giving

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,160
basically choices of Licensing

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,020
ecosystems maybe if you like GPL you can

00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,020
use it under GPL if you like Apache you

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,340
can use it under Apache this the intake

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,500
issue here is it sometimes people get

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,300
scared away because they see that GPL is

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,530
in the license list and the developer

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,690
saying I can't use it because of our

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,780
policy they don't always understand that

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,070
they have a choice or that certain

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:25,300
things are going to use like the cuddle

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,640
the CDL license or the GPL under

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,110
classpath exception these are these are

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,090
all very common in the Java world and

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,580
it's a little bit harder for people to

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,120
understand because it's a little more

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,160
complicated

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,110
GPL with class path exception what does

00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,360
that mean compared to this classic GPL

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,160
or if I see that I have a choice of this

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,140
or that so again this is part of the

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,700
education but even even some of the

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,010
legal folks that I've worked with they

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,560
say well do I like cuddle or do I like

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,360
Apache what's what's our preference so

00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,550
looking at your community if your java

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,650
your java shop you should really

00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,470
understand the CDL license you should

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:01,210
really understand the the GPL - with

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,040
class path exception these are probably

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,050
I'm not a lawyer but I see that that is

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,700
very commonly used inside of companies

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,980
but I also see that sometimes they'll

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,840
shy away they see the magic word GPL

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,760
they don't see it they see that as an

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,380
exception and they delete something that

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,060
was probably perfectly acceptable to use

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:21,580
inside their company another issue and

00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:23,860
I'll pick on one one organization here

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,150
just as an example of others is is Stack

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,800
Overflow this is a great

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,180
warum and question answer site that's

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,130
out there right now but this causes one

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,810
of the some of the biggest compliance

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,930
discussions among the legal teams that I

00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,550
work with because a couple reasons

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,840
number one is it's there's a lot of code

00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,070
that's coming in from the outside your

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,660
developers are going out to Stack

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,800
Overflow they're asking questions or

00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,660
they're seeing the same question that

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,670
they have there's a nice chunk of code

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:51,140
that fixes the problem that they have

00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:54,290
but the issue is is um I'm sorry I get

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:56,300
back here is all the code on sac

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,030
overflow is under a viral license it's

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,640
under a creative commons share-alike

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:03,260
license which is I'll say it's somewhat

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,420
similar to the GPL in the sense of that

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,190
it's more of a viral license the problem

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,110
is is that developers are all going out

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,300
there and grabbing this code and this

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,950
leads to this problem where your

00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,020
development team is saying everybody in

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,010
the world is using this code you know

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,780
where are we going to be the company

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,850
that doesn't use sac overflow and your

00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,590
legal team is saying well we know for

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,570
sure it's under a creative commons

00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,570
share-alike license we can't use that as

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:28,850
contrary to our policy and at least of

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,380
this clash and it's a class that

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,970
shouldn't be there but unfortunately it

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,960
so we I think for the next couple of

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,550
years we're gonna have to deal with this

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,110
there's a couple things you can do you

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,580
can always remove the code your

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,990
developers are gonna say why do I have

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,520
to do this everybody else is using this

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,190
so but that is something I see a lot of

00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,440
companies do you can rewrite the code be

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,840
careful that dirty room that we talked

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,280
about before but the most common thing I

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,740
see people who is actually reached the

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,980
legal team reaching out to the Stack

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,140
Overflow author explaining the situation

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,220
and saying can we rely since this code

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,580
can you give this to us under maybe

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,500
Apache 200 or MIT license and they they

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,510
should have they typically have the

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,770
rights to relicense that code and say

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,960
yeah of course I didn't understand that

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,820
this was an issue for you what do you

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,830
want and I strongly recommend you you

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,720
tell them the license that you want you

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,490
know we prefer stuff under Apache 200 or

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,030
MIT or whatever your favorite inbound

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,200
license is nine times out of 10 you'll

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,970
get a nice reply through the Stack

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,380
Overflow chat system says of course yes

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,900
here you have my permissions and then

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,490
you can put that in your doc but do be

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,080
aware of some ownership issues if

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,120
they're just Rita if they're to seen

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,950
Kate taking code off of Microsoft's MSDN

00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,420
and putting it up on Stack Overflow

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,160
they don't first up they don't have the

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,710
you know permission to relicense it

00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,789
under share-alike anyway and they all

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,230
so definitely can't give it to you at

00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:43,640
MIT so you might need to do a little

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,990
diligence in terms of where that code

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,909
came from but this is something that's

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,620
kind of an annoying compliance issue but

00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:50,270
I legal teams I work with they say well

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,830
we can't have people disrespecting the

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,659
open-source licenses if they ignore this

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,580
license what are their license are we

00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:56,600
teaching them to ignore and that's

00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,950
something I think we just need to deal

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,610
with some training and maybe continuing

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,610
with the community there okay this is

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,899
very related to cut and pastes

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,059
developers are going out there finding

00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:10,220
solutions to their problems sometimes

00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:12,110
they're bringing in entire libraries

00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,520
other times they find a good chunk of

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,039
code so if you're not familiar with some

00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,570
of these things basically somebody again

00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:19,309
to the law to Stack Overflow they'll

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,110
find something from a larger library

00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,490
that they like they'll cut and paste it

00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,899
into it and very often they lose the

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,909
copyright statements they lose the

00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:27,260
license text you want to bring that back

00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:28,820
in you want to make sure that the

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,230
copyright text is preserved you wanna

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,460
make sure the license text is preserved

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,230
you must want to make sure that the

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,299
license is appropriate for the way

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,470
you're using it so first thing is you

00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,750
want to identify that that's a cut and

00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,820
paste you might see the developers

00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,980
giving credit or credit to do you might

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,380
see where it says stolen from and then

00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,940
some website or thanks to and they're

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,289
not saying really they stole it but

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,840
they're giving credit where credit's do

00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:52,970
but the lawyers hate to see those words

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,340
in the in the codebase there so try to

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,350
try to work with your team have a policy

00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,730
for cutting and pasting have a policy so

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,590
that everybody knows that if they're

00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,529
taking something from the outside that

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,000
you want to track it you you should be

00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:08,390
careful of there's these things called

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,419
gists GIS t it's out there on github

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,980
there's some others you know forums etc

00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:14,690
they often lack the copyright and

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,580
license notice right there and there and

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,289
on the code from the original code

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,210
itself but developers should understand

00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:21,380
any time they use cut and paste any time

00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,750
they bring in something from the outside

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,340
you want to know where it came from who

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,740
wrote it what the license is and what

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,200
the permissions are and a standard and

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,090
kind of the standard remediation tasks

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,500
that are there as well and one thing to

00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,270
be careful is any time you see a cut and

00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,070
paste usually that's something that's

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,419
gonna be statically linked in to your

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,460
final product and we'll talk a little

00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:41,870
bit more about this tomorrow but linkage

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,289
issues are can be fairly complicated

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,549
especially around LGPL and GPL and that

00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,440
that you can have a whole conference on

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,850
on linking issues here but that's a

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,559
another question when you see certain

00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,000
licenses that may affect your

00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,060
permissions to you

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,010
okay one thing we're seeing more and

00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,740
more is people depending on external web

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,290
services rest api's and things like that

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,090
and at an open-source conference you

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,680
know there may not be any source code

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,500
here but it's still it's a third-party

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,320
dependency that often will come in that

00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,330
you need to manage and detect with the

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,290
GDP are people more and more people are

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,180
getting concerned around this because

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,010
this is a place where your customer data

00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,200
may be coming in to your company and

00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,700
leaving your company so tracking every

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,620
place where things are coming in from

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,210
the outside and leaving is is an

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,040
important compliance and security task

00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,150
these days this is also a sign that you

00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,580
can figure out more about what your

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,290
supply chain is what it were what is

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,400
this company what if this company goes

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,680
down do you have a service level

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,740
agreement with them what are the terms

00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,790
of use and things that work great in

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,610
development you know they may be hitting

00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,930
it 200 times a day suddenly breaks when

00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,610
you push it out to production and you're

00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,370
calling this web service a million times

00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,860
a day and they shut you off and your big

00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,480
new feature is killed we've seen some

00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,440
things here it's very often used in

00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,640
things like currency lookups GIS and

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,850
geography lookups mapping time services

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,260
a couple years ago Netgear had a big

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,060
problem where they embedded a web

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,710
service and a physical device that they

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,440
couldn't upgrade in the field and it

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,960
basically took off took the University

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,000
of Wisconsin down because it was hitting

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,919
on a device that was a time server that

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,750
was there and they've ended up having to

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,280
pay what about most four hundred

00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,679
thousand dollars to help out that

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,909
university to mitigate this problem so

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,740
if you're doing SAS it may be a little

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,110
easier for you to fix that issue after a

00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,700
day or two if you're making a IOT

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,530
product or something healthcare related

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,669
you may not be able to fix that in the

00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,970
field so you need to pay attention to

00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,050
that

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,370
and there's some things you can do

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,560
around detecting this you might want to

00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,179
use something like Wireshark watch the

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,310
actual content that's going over the

00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:48,240
wire as you're doing this do some code

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,800
scanning talk to your developers another

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,830
thing that we see that hits compliance

00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,350
issues is multimedia so images icons

00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,850
fonts things like that again have your

00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,650
policy in place have your developer to

00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,600
understand that these things are real

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,890
issues we also see that this sometimes

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,020
will come up as part of the open source

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,880
products so you're using a library it's

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,650
great it's under an MIT

00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,750
well then you seal the artwork is under

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,860
share-alike Creative Commons problem or

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:16,110
maybe it's coming from a company that

00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,550
sells clipart and you haven't paid for

00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,070
it so these are things that come up

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,330
especially in the commercial and the SAS

00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,710
organizations where you start to see all

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,120
our button icons came from an

00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,790
open-source product under a license that

00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,480
we can't use or the commercial images

00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:34,080
from from our standard set so again it's

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,420
a resource that needs to be tracked and

00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,520
that brings us last 2 minutes here

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,780
around our subcomponent issues we're

00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,640
starting to see more and more people

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,290
start to look inside of the the open

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,760
source that they're using so they look

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,310
at the top-level license let's say we

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,130
love MIT we love BSD we love Apache - oh

00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,450
then they look inside and they see GPL

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,020
they say creative commons share-alike

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:56,160
they see chrome or unpaid for commercial

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,930
and this is one of those things where

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,120
companies say well is it our is it our

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,160
job to fix this is it the open source

00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,870
products job to fix this and I think at

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,890
the heart of it you know the buck stops

00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,990
with you if you're shipping something

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,610
you're responsible for it I do see that

00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,720
companies are struggling with this this

00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,070
is something where you do need to work

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,630
with the foundations you need to work

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,600
with the individuals and source teams

00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,820
that are you're getting the code from

00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,490
identify what these issues are log these

00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,350
is defects as an IP defect

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,720
on their on their github or wherever

00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,390
they're doing their development explain

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,520
why it's important you may need to make

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,710
it your own Fork of this issue if you're

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,210
using a library and there's a big

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,950
problematic thing down there you may

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,360
need to fork make your own version of

00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,910
the open-source product for a little

00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,380
while until they fix the issue you may

00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,300
then find yourself not getting the same

00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,740
vulnerability fixes and whatnot so you

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,240
need to need to really manage whether

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,090
you really want to take that on or not

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,830
and in general the whole the whole

00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,180
ecosystem has these types of issues

00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,790
which you know there may be certain

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,890
foundations where code from them may be

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,150
more well vetted so you're gonna less

00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,670
likely have these if you have something

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,320
from an in University web the university

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,910
student who's out there on the web they

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,130
might not be paying attention to as much

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,900
to the the sub component issues as

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:11,700
somebody like a patch here in a set

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:13,650
cetera okay let me just skip to one last

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,200
issue here before we we have to drop to

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:19,269
get up back on stage here ISM is around

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,189
compliance issues so around the

00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:23,469
Oshin issues so your customers are gonna

00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:26,049
ask you for your bill of materials I'm

00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:27,880
gonna ask you for your your attributions

00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:29,709
and statements and your about box and

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,969
your documentation and most

00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:34,179
organizations are doing a really bad job

00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:35,409
of keeping track of this so you want to

00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:37,329
make sure that you're providing the

00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:38,679
right license text but especially if

00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,630
you're using something like maven or

00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:44,380
other repository managers sometimes they

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,149
just simply say MIT that's not the

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,459
license text that's just that the name

00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:51,189
of the license and if you go out to the

00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:53,259
you know what types of types of MIT

00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:55,179
license out there there's 22 more than

00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:56,499
22 variants of the MIT license out there

00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,699
with different legal tax different

00:37:56,499 --> 00:38:01,509
license texts so you just can't simply

00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:02,769
take the code and and put the random

00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:04,179
text and you have to talk to the author

00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:06,189
so the last thing I'll leave you with it

00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:09,099
today is it never hurts to reach out to

00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:10,929
the authors they are the owners of the

00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:13,359
IP they're the owners of the open source

00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:14,709
they tell you what's really the license

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,959
they tell you what's really the policy

00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,699
around it so do that reach out to them

00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:20,679
don't make up your own license text when

00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:23,019
you when you go in to see simply MIT and

00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:24,399
if you and if they don't answer you you

00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:26,529
you may need to do the classic

00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:27,729
remediation yep remediation step so I'll

00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,399
leave you with that today I'm available

00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:31,839
to talk afterward and I have a expanded

00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,380
version of this tomorrow so thanks so

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,920
much

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:39,349
[Applause]

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,349
