Presentation: Common Open Source Intake Issues and How to Resolve Them

In this talk Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management at Flexera, explores the lessons learned over years of experience with Open Source consumption, the most common compliance and security issues, reasons for software component rejection, and tips and tricks for improving your compliance efforts. It is becoming common for open source compliance reviews to be performed both when a component is being first selected, or later on after the component has already been integrated into a system. This presentation will detail the most common reasons why an open source software component would be rejected for use or would be removed from an existing system due to compliance or security reasons. This talk will include a checklist of the most common compliance review failures as well as the differences in expectations between the creators of open source packages and their users. Common remediation tasks, go-no tests and documentation expectations will be discussed. The talk is for anyone involved with ensuring open source license compliance.
