Title: OpenChain: a Tested Framework for Open Source Compliance - Andrew Katz - OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker :Andrew Katz, Managing Partner, Moorcrofts LLP
Presentation: OpenChain: a Tested Framework for Open Source Compliance

OpenChain is a scalable, flexible compliance programme, developed by the Linux Foundation. Based on well-understood compliance programmes such as ISO 27001, it maps existing supply-chain procurement and production practices from other sectors into software development. It provides a great foundation for businesses of all sizes to adopt appropriate practices and procedures in place to control development and supply chain risks, with particular emphasis on open source licence compliance. Already adopted by companies like Qualcomm, Siemens, Toyota and ARM, itâ€™s rapidly becoming a procurement standard for open source and open-source-derived software. The speaker, Andrew Katz, has helped companies of all sizes to adopt open chain procurement practices, and presents case studies on the process and benefits.

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:16,109
my name is Andrew Katz I'm a lawyer I

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,130
with a firm called more Crofts I've been

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,600
advising on free and open source

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:27,029
software since the 90s and I have

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,400
another hat which is that I am the CEO

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,219
of a company called or CRO which is

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,739
compliance company and this company

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,790
involves in includes work around

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:42,780
compliance in terms of open source

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,750
licensing now this talk is called them

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,030
introducing open chain one thing's

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,489
probably worth while emphasizing right

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,879
from the outset is that open chain has

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,840
nothing whatsoever to do with blockchain

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,120
unfortunately there is another project

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,800
called open chain which is to do with

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
blockchain this is nothing to do with it

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,770
so if you've got blockchain you'll be

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,470
very delighted to hear I'm not going to

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,610
be talking about blockchain at all and

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,490
I'm not gonna talk about anything at all

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,130
on the looks of things this is a famous

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,869
conference so the focus is on financial

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,420
services so I just briefly want to talk

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,689
about risk management in the finance

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,700
sector there are a lot of drivers

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,280
towards compliance as you know finance

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,990
sector very heavily regulated an example

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,450
is method two so one of the obligations

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:38,659
under the outsourcing section of method

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:42,659
2 is to make sure that you avoid undue

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:44,490
operational risk so how do you manage

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,040
risk right this is really going back to

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,750
first principles well there's three ways

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,720
of dealing with that I've you can pass

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,600
that risk on to the outsourcing provider

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,009
themselves through a contract or you can

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,240
pass the risk on to some sort of third

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,710
party like an insurance company or

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,159
ideally and most effectively you can

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,500
identify minimize and manage that risk

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,629
and that's really a process question

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,750
this is the most important of the risk

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,680
management issues so if you're talking

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,109
about risks that are in

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,189
in software with what are the risks that

00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,379
we're talking about

00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,329
well this functionality software doesn't

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,260
work properly that's something that open

00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:25,079
chain is not particularly concerned

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,790
about so we'll skip over that one we're

00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,310
concerned about security as well

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,590
that's something that somewhat clearly

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,829
of great importance open chain is not

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,139
particularly interested in security what

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:42,260
open chain is particularly focusing on

00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:44,400
is the question of licensing and IP risk

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,919
so if we just cover each one of those

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,540
categories very briefly so how do you

00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,769
deal with functionality risk well you

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,480
make sure the software comes from a

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,500
trusted source and you make sure that it

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,209
goes through appropriate quality

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,180
assurance that's really all I'm going to

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,430
say about that with security

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,159
okay trusted source quality assurance

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,169
are also relevant and you may subject

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,359
that software for things like pen

00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,889
testing and fuzzing or the service

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,099
that's provided by the outsource service

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,540
provider the Linux Foundation has a core

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,299
infrastructure initiative that's very

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,750
much focused on this as well safe code

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:21,090
is another initiative that is intended

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,579
to ensure the software components have

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,620
minimal vulnerabilities and then there's

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,209
a number of tooling providers like Black

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,989
Duck on flex era for example that

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,449
provide commercial solutions as far as

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,909
security is concerned open chain is not

00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,599
particularly concerned with those what

00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:41,579
we're mainly concerned about is

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,680
licensing an IP and to make sure that

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,069
the components that you're using are

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,859
correctly licensed then first of all

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,870
trusted source is obviously important

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,459
you need to look at the license

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,109
compatibility so make sure that the

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,299
licenses that you're using the various

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,560
components under don't cause a licensing

00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,790
problem when you combine them and I'll

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,280
explain this in a little more depth

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,290
later and there's various sorts of

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,560
tooling that can try to automate this

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,299
process black duck and flex era on the

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,419
flip side also do that sort of thing

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,340
sauce ID is another one and then on the

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,870
open source side of things there are

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,419
tools like water mustard also can

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:24,599
provide them the solutions so what

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,210
happens if everything hot goes horribly

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:31,199
wrong from a legal licensing perspective

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,819
well it's possible that you may end up

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,849
with a claim against you which results

00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,729
in payment on some sort of damages but

00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,610
potentially most damaging is the

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,229
possibility that there is an injunction

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,360
that prevents you from using that

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:48,389
software which is maybe business

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,039
critical to you or it may be that you're

00:04:48,389 --> 00:05:05,970
using an outsourced service provider

00:04:50,039 --> 00:05:07,470
then the provision ceases again right

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,449
okay so it may be because of some

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,099
contractual obligation that with you

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,889
have your with your outsourced service

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:15,120
provider if there is some sort of issue

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,690
as far as intellectual property is

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,900
concerned they cease that provision but

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,940
let's step back a little bit and look at

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,930
the context of modern software

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:35,520
development it's all about assembling

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:37,949
components and so I'm stealing an idea

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,570
from some Linux Foundation slides here

00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,470
just to give you an idea how this works

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,479
so basically the way that modern

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,699
software development works is you choose

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,620
a framework then you write some custom

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,599
code on top of that framework and then

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,460
to provide particular specific

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:54,270
functionality you use a bunch of

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,099
open-source libraries and in a typical

00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,090
project it's not unusual to find that

00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:02,880
the amount of open source used is in the

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,070
region of 90% the custom code is around

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,130
10% that's not unusual so an awful lot

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,360
of the code that is being used is open

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,870
source and there are many other sources

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,659
of that open source code SourceForge

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,620
github maven central repository being

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:24,300
three examples so now we talk about the

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:28,699
legal bit the little little asterisk

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,320
there means that I'm oversimplifying but

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,270
I am NOT going to explain in detail but

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,020
let's make the assumption that every

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,900
component of software that you use is

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,009
subject to copyright you're only able to

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,869
use those

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,539
components if each one of them is

00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:49,080
correctly licensed so every component

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,819
has to be properly licensed so what

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,219
happens if the components are not

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,629
correctly licensed okay well here's an

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,550
example is anyone familiar with the

00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:01,169
Linksys wrt54g so here we go picture of

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,969
this this beautiful beast

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:07,830
it's classic Garuda that was introduced

00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:10,710
in I think 2004 something like that long

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,610
story short is that it had some Linux

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:19,169
based firmware on it the Free Software

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,870
Foundation decided that there was a

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:25,289
potential infringement claim so they

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:31,319
started proceedings against Cisco which

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:32,550
owned Linksys at the time and anyway

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,639
they ultimately they reached a

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,459
settlement and which meant that not only

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,089
was the firmware of this Reuter made

00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:44,550
available it also became an absolute

00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,169
bestseller on the basis that it was one

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,379
of the few Reuters available at the time

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:52,499
that was very easy to put an alternative

00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:57,180
firmware in so the projects like open

00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:58,439
wrt which now provides firmware for just

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,319
about any rooty you can lay your hands

00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,300
on but in the outset it was based

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,189
because the wrt was based on on this

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,319
specific Reuter and I had to look on the

00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:12,389
line yesterday it was a version of this

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:15,659
the wor t-50 GL which is it was

00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:19,319
introduced in about I think 2005

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:21,149
specifically as a Linux based Reuter

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,469
it's still available so it's piece of

00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:24,180
technology that you can still buy

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,969
they're still making it apparently it

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,370
still makes you know millions of

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,490
millions of dollars a year for Linksys

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,120
and even though it's about sort of 40 50

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,069
quid

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,930
you can spend significantly less and

00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:39,779
actually get a much more highly

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:44,850
functioned router so what are the

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:48,959
scenarios that that are relevant when

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,430
you need to do an analysis again you

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,500
need to know what code you've got and

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,639
what the licensing situation is if

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,690
somebody comes at you with an

00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,460
infringement claim

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,580
there may be a case that somebody wants

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,570
to have a look at your codebase because

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,810
there's some sort of corporate due

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,690
diligence going on so potentially there

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:12,340
could be an IPO or some sort of funding

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:14,740
or an acquisition sometimes I've helped

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,550
clients to have a look at their software

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,840
compliance because of custom customer

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,630
due diligence and this is something that

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,460
will typically happen in a highly

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,880
regulated business like the finance

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:31,090
sector so something like method may be

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,370
driving the customers of an outsourced

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,740
service provider to say that outsource

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,050
put a service provider um you know you

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,450
are a critical part of our business

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,910
infrastructure what are you doing to

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,040
make sure that you are compliant with

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,660
all of your licensing so that we can

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,860
minimize the risk that there's a

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,450
potential problem of the service

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,090
suddenly being unavailable because of

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,910
sums of infringement problem and the

00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,820
concerns that that that organisations

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,190
may have and is that because of the

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,510
inadvertent inclusion of some part of

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,150
their code the whole of their codebase

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,490
and may be inadvertently open sourced

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,920
and or even they may be forced to

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,470
release their entire code base you know

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,900
including the secret source because it

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,270
contains some code like GPL that may

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,000
require them to do so as to risk their

00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:26,380
query whether that's possible or not but

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,270
this is a fear that people have so how

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,320
do you demonstrate as an organization

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,420
that has a code base that you're

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,240
compliant with all of the licenses well

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,810
what you need to do is to analyze the

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,580
code and analyze the licenses and it

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,080
tends to be true and truism that anyone

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,690
is that has ever been involved in a due

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,610
diligence process is that really it's

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,830
not so much about the information it's

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,510
not so much about the information that

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,150
you receive back as part of that process

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,410
but it's about the process itself so

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,060
when I've been involved in due diligence

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,280
processes you know I feel a lot more

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,080
comfortable going into an organisation

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,870
that can present me with a set of

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,670
information that is well organized

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,120
that's obviously been reached by a

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,170
sensible process van if I go into an

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,499
organization where everything's a

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,749
complete

00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,639
mess even if you know you'll even if

00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:16,449
when you go see underlying information

00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,489
it is actually all there so this means

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,319
you know a sensible well-run

00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:22,989
organization will have some sort of open

00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:26,349
source compliance program what does this

00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:28,569
look like well first of all you need to

00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:31,179
that the company is compliance with the

00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:32,589
licenses and then you need to make sure

00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:34,839
that there are good practices and

00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:38,229
procedures in place to ensure that that

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,449
compliance is maintained so typically

00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:44,379
the sort of things that you would expect

00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:46,329
to see in a well-run organization are

00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:49,119
first of all an open source policy

00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,979
itself you need to make sure that the

00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,289
staff are appropriately trained they

00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:57,399
know about the policy they know what the

00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:58,959
use cases are when it kicks in some sort

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,509
of policy for reviewing the licenses for

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,879
inbound code to make sure that they fit

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:05,319
in with the uses of the software and

00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,689
what the outbound licenses are going to

00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:10,749
be that the responsibilities of the

00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:12,159
individuals who are tasked with dealing

00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:14,349
with these particular issues are

00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,970
identified that their roles are

00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:17,589
empowered and that they're properly

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,989
funded they have the resources and able

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,089
to enable them to do their job you need

00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,339
to ensure that a bill of materials for

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,959
the products is generated so in other

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,429
words for each product you know exactly

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,979
the software components that have gone

00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:33,099
into that product and you know the

00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:35,709
licenses are attached to them and you

00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:39,099
need to have some sort of program for

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:40,839
dealing with common issues that may

00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:42,519
arise common queries that you may get

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,189
from your developer base or externally

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,659
and then you need to make sure that you

00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:47,979
have appropriate compliance materials

00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:49,479
and provided with the software so

00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,829
there's Apache components in there for

00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:53,229
example they have the appropriate notice

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,819
stop text files for other licenses they

00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:56,409
have the license text or the disclaimers

00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:59,049
or whatever the license demands that you

00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:01,749
need to supply alongside the license to

00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:02,859
make sure that it complies and then

00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:04,719
you'll typically also have a

00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:07,509
contribution policy for external

00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:08,709
projects and you know this is this is

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,999
what I've been doing for years when

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,439
clients come to me and say we need to

00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,739
put in place an open-source compliance

00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:17,679
policy these are the steps that I put in

00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:21,339
place which is why I was very interested

00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,930
a couple of years ago to come across

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:24,420
open

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,760
chain which is a product of the Linux

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:31,230
Foundation it's very well backed these

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,970
are a few of the members there are many

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,710
more now and until they're a couple of

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,570
very exciting announcements about to be

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,720
made in the next few weeks with some

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,959
some other big names that are joining

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,480
the list so open chain essentially

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,470
formalizes those characteristics that I

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,810
was talking about earlier it addresses

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,959
the question how do I trust free and

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:59,760
open source software that's in my supply

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,010
chain what it is well it's a standard to

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,300
describe what organizations could and

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,760
should do to address force compliance

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,880
efficiently and it identifies key

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,630
recommended processes and record-keeping

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,180
requirements for effective force

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,190
management and it builds trust and

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,779
increases efficiency by having Foss

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,790
processes and record-keeping consistent

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,990
across the supply chain and so that

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,940
means that organizations that are

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,400
interacting with each other they're

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,380
supplying one of them is supplying Foss

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,150
and the other organization is consuming

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,060
force it reduces the friction between

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,170
those organizations so how does it do

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,480
that well it consists of three

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,370
components first of all was a

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,850
specification then there's a curriculum

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,790
and then there's the requirement for

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:49,230
conformance so let me explain those in

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,760
turn the specification defines a core

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,600
set of requirements that every

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,850
compliance program must satisfy and the

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,020
idea is that I'll go into D little more

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,120
detail about what these these

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,279
requirements are but they're structured

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,240
in such a way that organizations of all

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:10,110
sizes and should be able to to be able

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,630
to implement the specification the

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,060
curriculum provides the educational

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,010
basis the materials that you need in

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,660
order for people at different levels

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,089
within the organization to be able to

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,100
educate themselves as to both what force

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,010
compliance is but also specifically and

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,740
what the open chain project and

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,390
compliance process is all about

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,550
and then conformance is the way that an

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,430
organization can demonstrate that it is

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:42,190
conforming with the open chain

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:43,750
specification so for for more details of

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,310
the links there I went going to them at

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:51,279
the moment but the slides will be

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:54,519
available later so we're trying to build

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,110
trust by creating a web of organizations

00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,899
which consumers and suppliers of free

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,040
and open-source software and we so that

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,839
we can ensure that they're all

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,699
conformance with the the open chain

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,130
specification it's all about reducing

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:09,399
that friction of transferring software

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,220
from one organization to another and

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,709
there's nothing in the open chain

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,389
specification that isn't something which

00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,250
well-run lots of developing companies

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,680
shouldn't be doing already it just puts

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,209
a little bit of structure around what

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,699
people tend to be doing or should be

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:30,220
doing on on on an ad-hoc basis so what

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:31,810
does conformance actually require well

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,610
the first thing is that you need to have

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,959
a formal Foss policy and you need to

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,389
make sure that all the relevant staff

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,380
within your organization know about it

00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:43,750
and they know how to access it the

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,459
relevant staff needs to have training so

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,350
they need to know about the Foss policy

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:49,329
they need to know about basic licensing

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,279
law they need to know about concepts and

00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:53,940
principles involved in open source

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,019
licensing and then you need to identify

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,600
what the internal roles and

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:01,420
responsibilities are of individuals who

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,740
are at different part in different parts

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,760
of your organization who are dealing

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,319
with the development deployment and

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,549
other aspects of free and open-source

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,650
software you need to have a process in

00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,480
place to establish the appropriate

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,140
license for each of the component that

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,339
you're using in a particular project and

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,780
then you need to have a mechanism for

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,490
determining what the restrictions and

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,380
obligations are applicable to those

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,579
licenses so that basically means you

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,500
need to know if you're going to comply

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,299
with GPL what you have to do to do that

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,790
if you can apply with apache complies

00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:37,559
with apache what you need to do in order

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:40,980
to maintain compliance and so on and

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:44,290
you've got to have an appointed

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:47,559
individual who has a responsibility for

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,880
both external and internal faucet

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,120
liaison on compliance they can't be the

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
same

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,420
person so Force liaison really has two

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,400
particular aspects of it first of all

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,490
it's for when somebody within the

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,690
organization wants to get involved in a

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,580
particular project and they may want to

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,559
contribute to a project and then there

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,620
needs to be a process for dealing with

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,360
that and it also may be the case that

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,300
various queries come from outside the

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,640
organization about that organizations

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,530
open source compliance and the FASTA

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
liaison person that can assist with that

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,660
process as well and then you need have

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,340
an internal compliance function and that

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,840
person is responsible for making sure

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,670
that all of the internal licensing is

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,740
correctly followed the internal

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,600
processes are followed and reviews the

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,120
internal policies to make sure they work

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,380
properly so anyone that's ever had any

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,059
involvement in any other sort of formal

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,220
and like quality assurance program for

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,720
example none of this will look unusual

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,660
at all they know the whole idea of this

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,820
program is that it's something that is

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,840
highly compatible with the other sort of

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,570
practices and procedures that

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,220
organizations have in terms of supply

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:04,390
chain management so you've got to have a

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,480
process to establish the Bill of

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,360
Materials and to make sure that you know

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,700
what all of the inbound components are

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,530
in any particular piece of software that

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,700
you are producing and that the licenses

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,070
are correctly assigned to each of the

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,280
components that are contained in that

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,200
bill of materials and you need to make

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,850
sure young your license management

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,410
process is able to deal with the common

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,990
use cases that you would have with the

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:35,950
various different types of open source

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,230
license and it's entirely legitimate for

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,110
that process to be Jennifer foot foot

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,880
for that policy to be very straight

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,650
forward I mean some organizations have

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,370
decided for good or bad reasons for

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,900
example that they not going to

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,480
incorporate any GPL code into their code

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,470
base at all you know we can argue talk

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,679
counts come home whether that's a good

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,150
idea or not but certainly you know I've

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,220
worked with organizations where they say

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,500
that to begin with that would be a

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,620
legitimate policy

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,660
and the open train specification but

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,040
then actually what happens is over time

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,570
they tend to realize they're developers

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,800
say we need to use this GPL code we're

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,780
using it internally I don't see what the

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,730
problem is or we you know we want to

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,960
engage with this particular community

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,010
and we want to fee everything we're

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,620
going to be doing on this project we

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,480
want to feedback again so so it tends to

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,040
be sort of internal pressures and from

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,560
developers to come up with a more

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,050
realistic policy and but you know these

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,420
are all things that can be dealt with

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:37,870
within the framework that open chain

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:39,360
provides you must also demonstrate that

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,590
you prepared all of the appropriate

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,030
materials that you need to be able to

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,230
provide with the software release so

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,440
you'll be familiar with the fact that

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,890
licenses and frequently require that

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,110
certain materials are provided alongside

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,520
the the code that you're providing that

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,920
can be the source code in certain cases

00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,920
it can be an offer to to make the source

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,270
code available more typically it's copy

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,800
of the license itself or copy of

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,310
disclaimers can play contained within

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,590
the license or a notice file for example

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,420
for Apache ins and some other licenses

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,950
as well so you need to make sure that to

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:17,500
maintain compliance all those materials

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,360
are also made available and so this is

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,110
the one piece of social engineering that

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,060
is contained within open chain you must

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,550
have a policy which covers contributions

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,280
by the organization to Foss projects now

00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:33,910
that policy may I would argue and wisely

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,910
say we do not we do not contribute to

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:40,330
Foss projects but the idea is that and

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,370
its intended to make organizations sit

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,800
and think about whether that's a good

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,210
idea it addresses their mind to the fact

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,010
that they really should have some sort

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,210
of policy and being forced to put in

00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,010
black and white we don't contribute to

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,320
external project means that that can

00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,970
start a dialogue with the developers and

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,380
the developers can be saying hey guys

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,730
this is really this really isn't such a

00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,710
great idea there are plenty of good

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,930
reasons why we do needs again involved

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,270
in external project so the tiny little

00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,430
bit of social engineering in there but

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,590
but the intention really is to try to

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,210
get organizations to think about the

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,960
ecosystem and how the ecosystem is

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,830
better for everyone the more people that

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,050
contribute to it and get involved in it

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:23,420
and then finally you've got to certify

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,190
that you comply with the specifications

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,720
requirement there's an online tool and

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:31,490
to enable people to do that so at the

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,620
moment people are perfectly capable of

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,970
self certifying they can go online they

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,650
can follow through the tool and if you

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,630
can tick all the boxes then it will say

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,910
congratulations you have now self

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,390
certified yourself as being open chain

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,680
compliant it is likely that on the

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,630
roadmap of development the next thing

00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,310
that happens is there are external

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,040
organizations that will come in and

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,710
formally validate that compliance our

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,880
role as both more Crofts and an or CRO

00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,860
has been to help a number of

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,070
organizations to get to the stage where

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,600
they can self certify and they're

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,120
comfortable and being comfortable to do

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,220
that but I think in common with other

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,110
other certification regimes in other

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,540
areas and it's likely that the next

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,610
stage is going to be at other

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,280
organizations specific certification

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:19,040
organizations and will be authorized to

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:26,230
grant open chain certification and to

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:28,700
organizations so what's the roadmap well

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,610
initially the idea is the members of the

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,700
the open chain project first of all they

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,760
will encourage their suppliers to become

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,950
open chain compliance and then this

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,970
stage may be reached that they will

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:46,100
start to prefer their suppliers to be

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,080
compliant and they will prefer those

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,330
suppliers who are compliant and then the

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,840
next stage is that it may be part of

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,550
their supplier filtering system that

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,650
they will only purchase from those

00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,900
suppliers who can demonstrate that they

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,140
are compliant so why is this a good

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,050
thing

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,910
well it eases supplier due diligence if

00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:07,370
you're looking at a number of competing

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,100
suppliers and if you know they're open

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,680
chain compliant then it means that you

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,090
know that they will have a set amount of

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,830
information available to be able to

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,570
demonstrate that they have fulfilled all

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,680
of those good characteristics they can

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,560
demonstrate that people have been

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,570
trained they can demonstrate that they

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,550
have all the materials that are

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,900
necessary to go with the piece of

00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,790
software that you're purchasing from

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,700
them you know that they have processes

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:34,980
in place that me

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,850
that the in from the the licenses

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,440
they're attached to the various

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:42,990
components in what you're purchasing

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,700
have been properly verified and so on so

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,260
basically you know one very simple way

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,970
of looking at is it is that it provides

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,370
has very simplified set to diligence

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,289
materials to enable somebody who is

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,480
selecting a supplier to be able to say

00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:55,860
right can you give me all of your the

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,110
materials that go alongside this

00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,909
particular software release so we find

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,019
it a lot easier then to determine that

00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:04,799
you're compliant with all these

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:07,289
different aspects of open chain so it

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,100
standardizes the availability of those

00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,809
documents and then from a from a from a

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,799
legal perspective it makes it a lot

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,960
easier when you're drafting a contract

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,519
with the supplier because then you know

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,590
a lot of the heavy lifting is done if

00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,840
you can simply incorporate a warranty

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,220
into the agreement that says that the

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,870
supplier warrants that they're open

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,100
chain compliant and that automatically

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,399
means that they will be able to provide

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,570
you with all of that additional material

00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:36,029
so the idea is that this really

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,100
generates a virtuous circle that the

00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,809
more people that use open chain it

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,450
standardizes within different

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:44,340
organizations the way that they handle

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,899
open-source compliance it means that any

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,190
two organizations who happen to be open

00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,380
chain compliance who are dealing with

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,820
each other know what they are supposed

00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,039
to expect in terms of the due diligence

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,510
materials they're receiving they have

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,639
some indication of how that other

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,289
organization is undertaking its

00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:04,320
development processes to make sure that

00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:06,779
they're compliant so the and ultimately

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,299
you know the intention is the the open

00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,779
chain project will be submitted to some

00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:14,820
form of formal standardization process

00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:18,090
so it can stand alongside things like I

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,889
serve 27001 it's just you know one of

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,529
the standards that a well-run

00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:24,269
organization will consider a Deering to

00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:27,149
as part of their normal supply chain

00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:28,769
management process so just thought might

00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:31,200
be useful just to have a look at a few

00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:33,000
quick case studies so one of the

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,440
important characteristics of open chain

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,880
this is very carefully designed so that

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,070
it's equally applicable to large

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,690
organizations as to small organizations

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,600
I mean clearly for smaller organization

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,710
there's less to be done but it is

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,590
designed to be very very

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,090
scalable so the organizations that I

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,770
showed you in the the earlier slide

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,200
there all's you know pretty large

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,910
organizations but I've worked with

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,260
clients of all sizes from very small

00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:00,270
companies to much larger companies so to

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,880
give you just a sort of flavor of the

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,020
sort of work that I've been doing here

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,030
this is one specifically from the

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,520
finance sector so this is a software

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:11,310
company that sells cloud services to

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,340
pension providers and this is the one

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:18,510
where they're regulated clients require

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,920
that they that the client their

00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,490
customers undertake due diligence on

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,140
them so that their customers are

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,670
comfortable that their system is not

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,730
going to be turned off basically because

00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:32,250
of some sort of compliance issue so

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,680
we're now able to provide a sponsor due

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,840
diligence process those end customers

00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,670
with the materials required by open

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,440
chain certification and that means that

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,670
they can takes those those customers can

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,070
tick the box in terms of their own

00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,510
compliance you know they can say what

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,250
have we looked at the risk of what

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,110
happens if our outsource service

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,700
provider suddenly ceases to function

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,890
because of some sort of IP infringement

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,080
issue yes we have and we're comfortable

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,820
that they they themselves are taking

00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,900
sensible steps to manage the risk so we

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,930
can rely on their risk management

00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,550
processes and this is this is a this is

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,930
a sort of relatively small piece of

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,780
software this about 20 developers

00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,940
working on it was like a hundred

00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,470
different packages so this is something

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,300
where we've been able to do the

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,740
compliance process manually we've looked

00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,630
at all the different components manually

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,720
but it's becoming increasingly difficult

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:22,440
to do that as the size of code bases

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,820
dramatically increases so this is

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,350
another example much larger organization

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:30,090
they provide a sector specific sass

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,760
provision to a particular vertical

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,890
market they've got well over 2,000

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:40,290
components in their code they've got

00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:42,720
about 200 developers they are taking the

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,790
commercial route to handle compliance

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,200
they're using Blackduck both to do an

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,740
initial code scan to see what they've

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:54,450
got and also to fit into their

00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,040
development processes as well and so why

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,510
did they come to meet us and help with

00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,000
this well they they realized

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,350
that they had an internally generated

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,610
Nev is something that they really needed

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,240
to get a handle on what their compliance

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:08,400
was and so they asked me to help them

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,110
with that but it's also because they are

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,310
operating in a highly regulated sector

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,230
they know that they're going to be

00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,150
receiving questions both during the

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,610
sales process and during their ongoing

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,440
relationship with their customers along

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,450
the lines of you know what happens if

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,950
our software suddenly ceases to work

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,170
because of some sort of infringement

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,930
issue what steps are you taking to avoid

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,980
that it's not it's not particularly

00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,480
mission-critical

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,310
it's important but it's not particularly

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,460
mission-critical which is why this isn't

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,410
something that has you know there's been

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,840
a sort of flurry of questions from

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,550
clients so far but they're moving into

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,750
areas that are more mission-critical so

00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,370
they really want to anticipate the

00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,320
questions that their customers are going

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,000
to be asking them so they can say yes

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,380
we're very confident that we've gone

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,990
through this whole compliance process

00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:58,410
properly and then this is one that I'm

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:01,860
able to name so this company called b2m

00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,240
solutions they provide some software

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,250
they have two different products ones

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,290
on-premise ones in the cloud and but

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,810
they basically do the same job which is

00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:12,000
that they work with large organizations

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,800
that have a big estate to mobile devices

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,720
there may be mobile phones or it may be

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,280
organizations that for example have

00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,830
those you know little scanners that

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:24,090
delivery people have to monitor winner

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:26,970
the parcel has arrived and so this is

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,010
this is software that interacts with

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,840
them and they can provide details of how

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,430
many machines there are out out in the

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,960
field more their battery state is and

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:37,290
how reliable they are and all this other

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,770
good stuff they using a lot of open

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,300
source software interestingly enough one

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,240
of their biggest resellers big Japanese

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,490
organization is itself open chain

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,810
compliant so they were quite familiar

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,060
with the idea of open chain and they're

00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:55,530
very supportive of this organization and

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,970
achieving open chain compliance we did

00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,320
the manual compliance job on this one

00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,000
that's because there's also a relatively

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,230
small number of components of as fewer

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,670
than hundred components in their

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:09,000
codebase and they have around 15

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:11,309
developers but that the we'd already

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,519
done about 90%

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:16,620
of the work as part of the previous

00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,240
compliance exercise and it was really

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,350
when I introduced open chain and said

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,940
well why don't you become open chain

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,860
compliance it only takes an extra 10%

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,970
which was basically at the two areas

00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:28,679
that we hadn't covered already were

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:32,549
appointing an early as an officer to

00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,909
deal with external liaison putting in a

00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:38,669
policy for dealing with external

00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,870
projects and also a little bit training

00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:42,240
as well that's the other thing that we

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,129
did but that was really a day's work and

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,070
we put those additional bits in and then

00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:48,299
we were able and to get them to a stage

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:57,210
where they were comfortable to self

00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:58,619
certify as open chain compliance so in

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,919
summary open source is all over the

00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:05,639
place you know that infringement risk is

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,619
an important consideration not only in

00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:09,419
terms of regulatory compliance but also

00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:13,799
in terms of procurement and M&A

00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:16,830
activities the risk can be assessed by

00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,419
analyzing the code and licensing and it

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,940
can be managed by implementing a

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:25,379
sensible inclusion and use policy which

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:27,600
is basically what open chain is adopting

00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:31,409
open chain is intended to increase

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,169
efficiency in the supply chain so it

00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,309
provides a framework for compliance

00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,419
there are other projects which you'll be

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,759
hearing about today some of which you

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:41,879
may have heard about already that are

00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,399
very closely interrelated with this so

00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:48,450
there's SPD X which provides a licensed

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:51,570
taxonomy it's intended to ensure that

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,220
each open-source software license has a

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,179
specific tag attached to it

00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,940
so it makes it a lot easier when

00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:59,009
producing builds and materials to be

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,570
able to very specifically identify the

00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:06,840
license that is attached to a particular

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:11,429
component SW 360 which myHealth spoke

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,110
about earlier on so that factor also

00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:15,919
assists with license compliance catalog

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:19,889
management for Saleh G's another

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,529
open-source tool which assists with

00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:24,600
license scanning and enables you to look

00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:27,240
at the code base and identify

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,039
from Fanta codebase what the licenses

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,419
are by scanning the license text and

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,720
looking at other useful attributes like

00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:35,880
copyright copyright notices and so on

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,830
and so really to populate the database

00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,269
of everything that goes with the Bill of

00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:44,519
Materials and quartermaster is another

00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:47,039
project that's a fairly early stages but

00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,590
that's basically a graph database that

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,880
will look at a project including all of

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,169
these dependencies go right down the

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,049
tree to all the dependencies create a

00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:57,240
graph database and the intention of that

00:33:55,049 --> 00:34:00,000
is that once you have a full picture of

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,809
all of the components that a project

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,919
contains and what the licenses are then

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:09,599
you'll be able to apply policies to each

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,139
of the the relationships and the

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,819
dependencies to determine whether within

00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,859
a particular company's rules that

00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:19,679
particular license relationship is

00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:21,599
acceptable and you know ultimately the

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,460
idea is that that will fit within part

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,950
of the tool chain so when you compile

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,119
the project as well as doing all of the

00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,369
sort of technical bits on the compiling

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,710
the linking and grabbing all the

00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:34,290
dependencies from external resorts the

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:38,909
repositories etc and it will also go

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,889
through a license compliance process and

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,899
in them ultimately you want to get to

00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,990
position where it just says yeah that

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:50,819
was fine based on the specific policies

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:54,839
that you've put into it right okay so I

00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:57,630
have gone through that extremely rapidly

00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:00,030
so that's okay so I think we've probably

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:10,890
got time for maybe one one or two

00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:12,329
questions so yes one over here I don't

00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,750
know actually Dave have you got if

00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:18,270
you've got a sort of a feel for that

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:20,369
yeah yeah I mean it's it's pretty early

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,849
stages at the moment I mean I've

00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:27,119
personally I've got five compliance

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:29,760
projects going on at the moment only one

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,630
of which is sort of made it to final

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,890
completion the rest are all in in course

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,230
I mean that that sort of gives you an

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,220
idea but you know we're talking to some

00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,349
very very long

00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:44,780
organizations who really want to roll

00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,780
that out across all of their companies

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,810
I mean geographically there's a lot of

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,090
activity in the Far East because Shane

00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,310
Conklin who's the program manager for

00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:02,070
open chain is very very active he lives

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,900
in Japan so he's very active over there

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,390
so that's why this sort of companies

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:11,280
like sort of Hitachi Toyota Panasonic

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:13,800
but it's probably not true to say this

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,140
any it is sector specific there's a fair

00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,790
amount of automotive I mean the Toyota

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,410
has been mentioned in there I'm talking

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,970
to a lot of other large orca automotive

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,290
companies who are it sort of equally

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:51,030
interested as well so there's certainly

00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:52,800
a lot of interest in automotive in terms

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,960
of actual protection I mean none at all

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,790
it's really intended to be a means of

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,310
knowing what your code base is and also

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,140
being able to look at what other

00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,220
organizations have done so that you can

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,859
see can simplify the due diligence

00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,900
process but you can you can work along

00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:09,420
other organizations like open invention

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,859
Network and lock nets which can sort of

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,310
help with some of the patent issues as

00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,310
well yes

00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:45,260
right I just saw me to the transfer

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:57,330
pricing issue so I can you can you so

00:37:45,260 --> 00:38:02,040
explain looking yes yes yeah yeah thank

00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:04,020
you most of which are but deal with

00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,180
print transfer pricing is a little

00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:20,160
multinational that has operations in

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:22,530
various countries right no exactly

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,600
exactly yeah yeah exactly

00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,470
and I think in a way that that sort of

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,760
has a it may have the effect of negating

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,560
some of that some of the benefits of

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,690
open source software in the first place

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,130
I mean one of the benefits that I see in

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,650
open source software is the ability for

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:40,320
organizations to come together and

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,050
collaborate between between themselves

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,260
in a way that is not subject in the same

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:50,220
way to sort of antitrust competition law

00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,750
scrutiny so I you know I guess a similar

00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,520
concern as far as transfer pricing is

00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,190
concerned and if you can apply the

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,010
similar sort of arguments to say well

00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,109
hang on you know anyone can get involved

00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,000
in this particular organization like the

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,260
Geneva project for example which you

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,180
know involves a large automotive

00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,640
manufacturers but all the way down to

00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,380
individuals so if anyone can get

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,560
involved in it and if they're really the

00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,119
only way that this this or this this

00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,880
project is being centrally managed is

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,060
through its license agreement then that

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,410
negates the antitrust issues then I

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,910
guess you could try to apply the same

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:26,190
argument as far as open source and

00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,750
transfer pricing is concerned and say

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,430
well fundamentally if we're producing

00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,960
open source software this software you

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,460
know is available not only to ourselves

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,900
internally but to anyone else

00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:39,800
essentially at zero cost whether that's

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,510
an argument that'll run or not yeah yeah

00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,150
I mean that's it's an interesting and

00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,410
sort of scary issue and it's not

00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,790
specifically something as addressed by

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,900
open chain but it is it is an

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,609
interesting and scary issue and sorry

00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,170
what was the what was the second

00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:54,480
and people trying to turn a month of

00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,029
Licensing to make that the politician go

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,220
away yeah again I think this is this is

00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:02,160
something that open train is really

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,660
agnostic to that and all it's doing is

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,160
making it easier for people to get the

00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,559
information they need about components

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,789
and licensing and then they can make

00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,910
their own determination as to whether

00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:13,910
any patent issues availing to look at

00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:37,259
well I think yeah okay so I mean in that

00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:39,839
sense the chains about processes around

00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:41,970
a resource case if you have processes of

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,039
c2 so they would so obenchain would

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:47,249
accurately report that it was an MIT

00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,650
license fee for supper and not catch

00:40:47,249 --> 00:41:22,200
that there was a separate agreement but

00:40:49,650 --> 00:41:24,119
not a bit about that yeah so I don't

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,420
think that open chain is effectively yet

00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,299
the issue that you know has this like

00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:35,609
that's been modified in any way that I

00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:41,430
mean yeah I know

00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:43,739
I see what you're saying I think the

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,960
point of open chain was to create trust

00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:47,970
in the supply chain by knowing that your

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,859
supplier has a process because there's

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,789
no prints pairen see around that

00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,979
previously

00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:54,299
then you get companies asking for your

00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:56,759
food and then getting into them again

00:41:54,299 --> 00:42:00,390
going home you know how I trust that

00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:05,519
whatever so so I think the indirect

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:07,319
answer it said by having a standard that

00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,749
talks about what good processes look

00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:13,349
like you just sort of you know open that

00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:15,119
up to some companies were in the dark

00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:17,069
about that much more very many and then

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,479
if you have a process through more

00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:20,069
likely to find instance you don't have a

00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:20,880
process I think exactly what you said

00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:22,859
would happen to sort of

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,859
misidentification is far more likely but

00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:28,859
if you're aware and educated on issues

00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:30,359
and they need education in your company

00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,640
and you need to have these processes

00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:49,559
then those processes should be catching

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:50,849
this kind of and various yeah there is I

00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,739
can talk to you about those separately I

00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:54,539
mean I when I'm dealing with clients

00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:55,709
I've sort of gone one step beyond open

00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,630
chain over a little section that talks

00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:59,640
about patents separately but it's not

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,409
you know but it's not currently part of

00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,689
the open chain specification so the

00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:05,519
scope to have a look at that yeah okay

00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:08,329
right okay

00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,329
thanks very much everybody

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,400
