Presentation: OpenChain: a Tested Framework for Open Source Compliance

OpenChain is a scalable, flexible compliance programme, developed by the Linux Foundation. Based on well-understood compliance programmes such as ISO 27001, it maps existing supply-chain procurement and production practices from other sectors into software development. It provides a great foundation for businesses of all sizes to adopt appropriate practices and procedures in place to control development and supply chain risks, with particular emphasis on open source licence compliance. Already adopted by companies like Qualcomm, Siemens, Toyota and ARM, itâ€™s rapidly becoming a procurement standard for open source and open-source-derived software. The speaker, Andrew Katz, has helped companies of all sizes to adopt open chain procurement practices, and presents case studies on the process and benefits.
