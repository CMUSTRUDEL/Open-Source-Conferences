Title: Coordinate, Collaborate, Compete: Open Tools for the Next-Generation Financial Industry

Amber led J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence since its inception in 2015, recently leaving to launch Clovyr. She has sought to increase engagement in blockchain development within the information security community, leading integration of some of the first advanced bug hunting tools into the open source Quorum blockchain platform, as well as presenting at Empire Hacking, Hack in the Box, and elsewhere. Appearing on 2017’s Fortune’s 40 Under 40 list of the most influential young people in business and CoinDesk’s 10 Most Influential in Blockchain, she “handily bridges the divide between the Wall Street and crypto sets.

[Music]

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:16,080
well welcome everybody we're going to

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,050
call this the jam band session of that's

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,010
a been joking about her favorite jams

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,150
but thank you everybody

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:31,710
I think it's been really great morning

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:34,739
programs hi my name is amber ball day

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,000
and I'm co-founder and CEO at clover so

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,510
we're gonna jump right into it amber

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,739
he's off to Boston so she's gonna catch

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,050
a flight so we're gonna jump right into

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,930
this so he amber you spoke last year in

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,180
New York can give an update as to what

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,239
you've been up to any changes any things

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,030
new things been working on CeCe

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,350
I apologize I can't speak to you people

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,059
is the mic is this way that will loose

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,390
Meister but I'm thinking of me fondly on

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,360
that side so last year I was speaking

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,000
about JP Morgan's open-source program

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,780
and how blockchain specifically was

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,850
being a success story for the bank in

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,650
furthering the technical and business

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,770
goals of the organization and also kind

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,659
of the beginning of Fidel's and so it's

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,820
that's been a great journey and they're

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,500
working on forum at the time which is

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,729
very familiar with what's happening out

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,979
of the blockchain land is a

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,409
privacy-preserving Enterprise focused

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,659
version of an ethereal blockchain and

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,180
that project is continues to go Greek

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,159
it's opening sourced and where there's a

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,040
growing community building projects on

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,130
it but since then I did transition to

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,710
clover which I co-founded with Patrick

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,900
Neilson

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,510
the lead engineer for that project and

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,670
since then we are working on more

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,620
industry agnostic developer tooling for

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,480
building decentralized applications we

00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,680
can talk more about what that means but

00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,410
form is still part of that we're

00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,510
building on top of form but also public

00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,970
of theory on parity polka-dot a few

00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,710
other things code bases and also some

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,690
non Bloch in things which is interesting

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,459
so that's great

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:16,410
now I also extend that you're on the

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:18,550
board for a little bit that's all about

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,560
how does that fit in except I've been

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,420
reading all this stuff about zero

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,910
knowledge proof service some of us have

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,970
and how does that all fit in because I'm

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,140
hearing about zero cash proofs in kind

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,060
of think I understand it but a little

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,790
bit but but your involvement because

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,670
that all fits some stuff you're getting

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,080
well I think even the mathematicians and

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,790
cryptographers that were coming near

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,350
knowledge proofs only kind of understand

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,959
what zero knowledge proof do so they're

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,150
kind of refer to as moon math but yeah

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,380
one of the things that we had done while

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:54,750
at JP was releasing the first first

00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:57,610
enterprise grade production version of a

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,170
zero knowledge token that was stored on

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,640
a block chain so to be clear I'm on the

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,920
board of the C cash foundation which is

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,170
it not that's a non-profit and they

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,269
actually that the nonprofit serves as a

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,120
governance check on the Z cash company

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,860
which is a for-profit organization and

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,660
so the work that we had done previously

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,660
was about figuring out how you could

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,010
shield some information about what's

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,549
happening with these various crypto

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,680
circuits

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,560
privacy in general is just a huge

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,660
problem people have this impression that

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,190
block chains and crypto assets are

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,290
private because they heard about the

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,519
anonymity properties of Bitcoin but

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,500
actually the ledger is entirely

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,019
transparent and that causes huge

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,390
problems if you want to do anything that

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,519
is a business value or has your kind of

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,620
proprietary secret sauce in there let

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,140
alone moving our national economy onto

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,450
twitter for your bank account so on so

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,360
the principle of Z cash itself

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,160
to create a more private fungible token

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,890
version of something like Bitcoin and

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,150
the work that we had done while at JP

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,730
was to make that applied to business

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,319
logic as well so going forward what

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,510
we're working on really is about

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,900
fostering financial privacy and freedom

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,160
on the internet so the the nonprofit

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,450
foundation is a little closer to

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,340
something like the Electronic Frontier

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,530
Foundation and I also work with the

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,940
human rights foundation you know when we

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,730
talk about banking the unbanked and

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,190
extending financial services globally it

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,010
really it matters what kind of services

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,720
were providing to people as to what the

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,820
next generation of Finance looks like

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,639
and whom it serves so it sounds like

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,169
privacy is really important what so as

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,510
we think about the financial services

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,580
audience and the industry as a whole

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,560
what are some other things that you

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,780
think mantle service is going to need

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,030
look generally but also as it continues

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,270
to look at not just blocked images other

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,880
defense technologies in general well

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,040
almost all of the pilots and prototypes

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,650
that exist right now the ones that are

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,270
more than just a press release at least

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,550
they have big hard coded a variety of

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,289
things as you do in prototype but they

00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,180
need to be replaced before these can

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,550
become real production systems so

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,860
whether that's the rate of LIBOR coming

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,860
from somebody's Excel spreadsheet on

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,840
some laptop instead of from an actual

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,360
market data source where whether that's

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,350
integration with existing ERPs like s AP

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,930
article etc or whether it's even

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,100
additional just small utilities of

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,169
things that you would do over and over

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,760
something like signing a document you

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,500
know you want to track kind of like a

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,169
DocuSign sort of functionality something

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,910
simple like that every organization

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,460
right now is writing those pieces

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,169
themselves over and over and not only

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,150
does that increase the time to go risk

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,470
that at least one or more of these

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,450
organizations is going to do something

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,820
not quite right but it also is just a

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,880
huge

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,950
some resources you know - gaps points at

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,590
the top of the day he was talking about

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,850
utilizing the developer stack so that

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,620
you can get to the part where you're

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,690
building that proprietary secret sauce

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,480
part of your applications we should have

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,920
this kind of standard libraries when

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,540
you're building decentralized apps and

00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,190
it just it just does not exist yet

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,860
there's no such thing as similar to like

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,450
the C standard library for watching so

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,060
so you've had this experience at

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,980
JPMorgan now your you've got your own

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,990
little talked about a little bit more in

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,570
a second what what generally do you

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,310
think the industry needs and when you

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,860
think about next generation financial

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:23,450
services what are some of the citizen

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,710
components well I mean to the points and

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,310
I guess they're going to announce things

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:31,160
in a second care but not to jump the gun

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,860
or anything but to that point I think we

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,560
we need to have open platforms that

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,570
people work on collaboratively and more

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,150
and more modern DevOps tools are

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,520
collections of libraries and tools that

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,130
do useful things in a standalone way and

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,490
then are also synergistically worth more

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,380
collectively as a whole and so having

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,060
choices for all the financial

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,890
institutions as they build applications

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,210
rather than saying we had picked this

00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,410
stack and it's Turtles all the way down

00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,240
and like if they haven't made that

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,370
library yet like we're screwed

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,060
uh-huh you want to have this kind of

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:08,450
open place where there's there's choice

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,340
and while free consulting services

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,980
upfront have been a huge catalyst in

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,450
exploration of blockchain technology for

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,950
both financial services and other

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,870
industry

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,970
in the longer term we don't want those

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,070
choices to just be creating the same

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,410
kind of fenders sticky solutions that we

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,140
have you know open sourcing a community

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,650
version is not the same thing as a true

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,240
open-source framework so we are here to

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,000
announce that we're doing a

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,290
decentralized ecosystem program so that

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,550
sounds great great great teaser and

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,010
we're gonna start that off with some

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,570
additional contributions over the next

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,430
few months from from clover but why

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,380
don't you talk a little bit about what

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,810
clover is up to because there's a lot of

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,180
buzz about clover and what you're up to

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,830
and I've heard some different

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,230
comparisons and what it is so tell us a

00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:01,780
little bit about what visits it sounds

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,590
really exciting cool yes so I mean - all

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,250
of the things that I mentioned

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,960
previously about needing to replace all

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,440
these things that are hard-coded hacks

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,630
right now with real strategic solutions

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,760
the where those things are financial

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,460
industry specific I'm happy to

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,750
open-source those things group that else

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,330
but what we are building is industry

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,520
agnostic and is more akin to or

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,550
hopefully what we can catalyze is a

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,020
transition metaphorically from I often

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:39,250
if anyone can remember something like

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:40,990
cold fusion and CGI but the transition

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,050
to something like Heroku plus Ruby on

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,830
Rails was a huge catalyst for getting

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,750
the Main Street kind of businesses to

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,350
register their first comps the ability

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,940
to have reusable ecommerce toolkits was

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,150
a huge catalyst and after that you got

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,200
things like stripe that continued to

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,870
kind of be destructive

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,540
but right now only you know 1% of

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,120
businesses have the money to afford to

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,270
experiment and innovate when it comes to

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,550
the building

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,950
systems or blockchain applications and

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,320
so making it so that the tool set that

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,480
can solve a problem that you have as a

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,010
start-up developer or a hobbyist with

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,740
it's really--it that you like that bends

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,110
up it turns out to also be used in your

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,360
business would be a huge game changer so

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,310
lowering the barrier to entry making

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,200
tools reusable and I think it's been a

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,340
bit of a misnomer that people have

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,960
thought you know because I was running

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,210
this blockchain program that now when

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,680
created an enterprise blockchain company

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,510
it's not so much that it's a we

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,000
shouldn't just have enterprise software

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,490
so much of the DevOps movement has been

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,050
about getting away from the idea that we

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,610
have this like tightly coupled Java

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,470
stack that this is the only thing we do

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,940
but creating tools that are useful

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,680
throughout the world and that will

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,860
foster more interconnectivity between

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,960
businesses at all tiers of the market

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,460
cap spectrum so it sounds like what

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,890
clovers doing is not specific to a

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,080
particular block chain or particular

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,810
technologies and by getting it or even

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,610
just to go change yeah okay I mean what

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,080
we're trying to do at clover is a little

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,750
different than normal focus with things

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,970
probably but what we're working on doing

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,180
is helping people build applications

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,800
that challenge existing business models

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,690
and the power structures that those

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,300
business models facilitate you know I'm

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,980
looking at use surveillance capitalism

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,020
in Franza also let people build

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,020
applications that foster human consent

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,550
and put privacy first so I know that's a

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,550
hard sell for enterprise banking

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,460
probably but it's going to become more

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,650
and more apparent I think as entities

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,000
like Google and other data aggregators

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,590
become the main institutions that have

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,270
so much of the world's data that it is

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:51,200
becoming harder and harder to compete

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:55,040
and drive drive business value from data

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,500
driven products so right now top to your

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,930
institutions fortune 10 maybe fortune

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,360
100 companies are able to keep up with

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,340
that data work but even that is becoming

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,890
more difficult let alone for tier 3 or

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,570
tier 4 organizations so what were what

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,330
we're doing longer-term is helping

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,040
connect the world's data and that goes

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,120
two ways it either becomes a terrifying

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,949
disco

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,629
we're just kind of where we're headed

00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:19,069
right now or we need to do more work

00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,629
exactly around kind of the zero

00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:24,920
knowledge proof things that we mentioned

00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:27,259
earlier around around data analysis and

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,910
machine learning and AI driven over

00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,920
encrypted data sets that are

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,839
decentralized stored at the point of

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,910
origin that have leased authority access

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,740
controls that are well thought out from

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,709
the beginning about where we're going

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,439
you know we got into this point with the

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,490
the technical giants right now where we

00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,809
kind of were like oh that's just a

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,249
social media company like we're just

00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,350
posting pictures of our friends you know

00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:51,079
we didn't quite see where these things

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,089
were going to go and you know if we

00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,889
don't learn from history of course we

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,480
are doomed to repeat it so we have this

00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,819
opportunity now that if we were

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,930
recreating the internet what would we do

00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:03,100
differently we probably put

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:06,290
cybersecurity higher the importance list

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,519
and we would probably put humans a

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,230
little higher up there because at the

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,029
end of the day we represent companies

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,329
but companies are made of people

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,860
although companies also people I'm sorry

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:25,550
I'm American and American companies are

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:27,350
people the program and clover is more

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,970
than just blockchain and then we're

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,620
really thinking about what a world looks

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,689
like or what a technology stack looks

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,850
like from a decentralized perspective

00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:37,939
can you just maybe elaborate a little

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,610
bit on that because Y is just

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:43,939
decentralized more generally important I

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,709
know you know you like myself as a fan

00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:47,749
typically firstly and some of the things

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:49,699
that he's been talking about so what

00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:51,559
like why should we be focused on

00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,230
decentralized more properly rather than

00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,689
the hot or maybe not hot right now area

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,889
of budget well I mean you certainly

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,949
wouldn't want to put all the world's

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:02,120
data watching that's not a great idea

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,870
even if you do just

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,430
that's a slow database but using that

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,440
kind of technology as a connective

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,630
tissue can be helpful but there were our

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,040
existing decentralized applications that

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:17,720
we use that solve problems that we have

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,240
so I mean every time you type an address

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,790
anywhere along URL bar we're accessing

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,130
DNS if dns is a decentralized globally

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,740
distributed system which has its own

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,910
problems but you know BitTorrent whether

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,589
or not anyone wants to admit that

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,690
they've ever used vitur to access media

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,390
that is a decentralized system and has

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,710
been very resistant to censorship

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,839
because of it but you know traffic under

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,940
torn is down 90% since Netflix rates

00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,770
because most people don't want to go out

00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,920
and do something that it's risky if you

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,670
have a non risky option so with with the

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,110
rise of both crypto assets but also

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,570
machine learning and kind of business

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,490
value being driven off of this larger

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,550
data set we have this kind of new

00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,690
opportunity to achieve some things that

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,270
previously were not really possible

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,440
whether that's micro transactions

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,770
driving the next kind of generation

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,110
economy or more free flow of data in a

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:13,279
way that's more monetizable to the

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,080
people that own that data it's the the

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,450
time is its right to actually innovate

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,279
and try to do something like you know

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,320
Tim berners-lee really tried to do the

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,209
Semantic Web in 2009 and has always had

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,730
the same dream if you look at why that

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,890
didn't happen it's not because people

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,930
refused to mark up their blogs using the

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,650
same global ontology which probably

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,690
isn't going to happen

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,670
it's because it's easier to parse it the

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,680
contents of a web page and pull out the

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,170
actual extract the meaning of that data

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,760
using natural language processing than

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,620
it is to trust what somebody said for

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,630
SEO so we need to look at why those

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,690
things failed because the same people to

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,760
berners-lee included are proposing new

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,560
decentralized programs and a lot of it

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,089
just sounds like the same record of what

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,370
didn't work the first time around and

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,740
the cyberpunk dream will remain a dream

00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,570
if we can figure out a way to make it

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,750
relevant to the large corporations in

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,750
the world

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:20,720
so you're here to announce we did but

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,610
you know besides just me or anything

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,250
right right so that's where I'm going

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,350
any questions when I hire you but so so

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,540
we're here too so the 11 this is the

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,020
11th program we announced the 10th this

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,360
morning so they left the program so you

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,089
worked on it bringing it forward with

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,459
IHS market so how did that come about

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:45,530
and how that operations start to emerge

00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:50,180
and yeah so market is one of the leading

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:52,100
members of fast and obviously really

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,839
core to the financial industry fabric

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,850
and holds a lot of pieces of the

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,790
industry together and then also been

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,880
working they have a very robust watching

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,250
program since very early on working with

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,750
quorum but also working with activity

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,180
and some of the other players in the

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,770
industry and so we've had open channels

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,310
of communication with them for a long

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:15,440
time and just in hearing kind of what we

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,270
were working on I they were one of the

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,920
companies that's like well but we're

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,079
trying to build that all ourselves and

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,970
we don't know what to do and if we want

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,440
to you know do that in-house forever and

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,000
then once we build something as a

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,440
corporate in-house there will be

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,630
pressure for us to figure out how to

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,920
monetize it and keep it here and you

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,010
know even if we want to give it away so

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,170
what can we do to to shift our focus now

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,420
from building you know infrastructure

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,640
fabric to building meaningful

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,650
applications for our business and so

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,910
those kind of stars Alliance and there's

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,950
certainly if there's other Boethius

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,720
members and some startups and some

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,880
nonprofits that are working in this area

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,310
that I think will all kind of come

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,000
together in the decentralized ecosystem

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,460
growth

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,470
shortly but today we were just wanted to

00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,830
announce market since they're our

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:05,300
sponsor and me since I'm here yeah I

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:07,130
remember one of my first meetings Frank

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,500
who some of you know from is one that we

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,270
got into a very lengthy conversation I'm

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:19,250
gonna add some of you ace in the right

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:20,689
place so it's a shout out Haskell yeah

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,589
check it out

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,760
type systems are great so how do you see

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,880
this program so you mentioned a couple

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:33,890
others a couple Eric and Scioscia how do

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,300
you see this program and particularly

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,640
this program for the know Scott is this

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,870
going to fit in with the other sort of

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:49,370
not galaxy at least the solar system our

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:51,020
mutual Carl Sagan there too yeah I mean

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,480
if you follow the insider baseball of

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,520
them will enterprise watching there's no

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,370
shortage of existing consortia for this

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,950
so whether it's hyper ledger or the

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:05,030
Enterprise aetherium Alliance there's

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,290
others I guess I think that it's a

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,510
fundamentally different thing first of

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,220
all it's not a sexy being the

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,120
centralized ecosystem growth I get that

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,950
but it was intentionally chosen number

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,740
one because it's not just about us doing

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,920
blockchain use cases and number two

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,450
because it's about growing this entire

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,890
ecosystem of people that want to

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,200
contribute and can do something useful

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,200
with these sorts of technologies

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,930
together so it's not about supporting a

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,510
specific vendor stack it is not about

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,630
selling one products over another

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,610
product it is about building open source

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,000
code not about creating powerpoints and

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:47,410
PDFs of standards it's it's a code

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
contribution driven kind of program and

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,800
that said I also kind of take offense to

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,559
the term democracy just for what it's

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,330
worth because I think we do end up

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,039
question where larger companies that

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,350
decide to throw resources at something

00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,940
end up doing more and then take over

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,210
things over time to the detriment of

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,840
smaller voices so making sure that what

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,850
we're doing is growing growing the pie

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,350
and not just aggregating more and more

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,360
of the pie to a smaller number of

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,700
participants is equipment we'll figure

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,740
out what that means governance wise but

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,629
yeah I mean success will look like the

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,950
nose members and people that aren't a

00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:25,909
part of Hiddleston's the code will be

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,679
open source being able to do a useful

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,179
thing without having to get ten

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,740
companies around the table with a bunch

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:32,600
of lawyers and decide on an 18-month

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,789
road map before anybody puts their hands

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,019
on a keyboard

00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,240
if it helps what we're building it

00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,580
clover is also all executable without a

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,399
true account so you know whether or not

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,159
that helps enterprises I don't know yeah

00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:48,409
we we want to make it easy for people to

00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,080
experiments and play and build things

00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:53,299
that aren't just useful because a

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,679
start-up you know read a Wikipedia page

00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,730
about trade finance and thinks now

00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,950
they're going to go revolutionize the

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,049
industry we need people that are

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,369
embedded that understand both the

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,919
business challenges and the technical

00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,419
challenges to make it as real so that

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,429
brings me to my last question what you

00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,049
see is the role we have you know some of

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,519
the leading financial institutions in

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,610
the world

00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:17,690
what do you see is the role of banks

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,909
capital markets Boles bracket the other

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,029
companies that work in that space what

00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:26,929
do you see there there in terms of the

00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:28,759
ones love tank space I mean it depends

00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:32,210
how quickly we can get it together here

00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:33,590
you know the other large incumbents

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,360
whether it's Facebook finally announced

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,619
their blockchain program and to my

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,379
surprise I thought it was going to be

00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:43,039
about in messenger payments and it's not

00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:45,499
it's about data collections across local

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,570
jurisdictions for them because that is

00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:49,200
what blockchain can facilitate its

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,570
Crossing trust boundaries

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,850
that's elsewhere so we need to get it

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,690
together I think that there's been a lot

00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,290
of focus on in two directions one is can

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,520
we figure out how to custody or let our

00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,800
consumers do something with

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,090
cryptocurrency because they are coming

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,550
to us and asking us if we have that

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,920
product and the other is how can we

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,380
tokenize stuff we've already dot whether

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,540
it's existing securities or things that

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,080
could be fractionalized better that

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,430
aren't yet tradable in a liquid way so

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,860
those have been the two streams that

00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,150
we've been like kind of focused on but

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,450
if we get to a point where we are

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,070
considering data as more of a non

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,530
fungible asset that has some of these

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,480
properties of scarcity about it custody

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,970
of data is going to become a huge thing

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,870
payment for that custody and custody of

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:42,270
digital assets in general can be massive

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,830
so there's there's so much business to

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,440
be done if we're beginning to kind of

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:49,170
redefine what Finance means more broadly

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,400
to it as the line between data and money

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,980
because it's just kind of fall apart

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,050
that's interesting and then also we just

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,700
have this huge influx of consumers

00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,200
coming in that have a different idea

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,470
about what financial services should

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,850
provide for us so making sure that we're

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,980
meeting that kind of next-generation

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,920
with the types of assets that they want

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,690
to bring in to the bank for the entire

00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,900
lifecycle the entire financial life

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:16,260
cycle there is we have to get back great

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,930
so like I said amber has to get get to

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,300
Boston but probably time for two

00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,340
questions is what one would like to ask

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,930
a couple questions great here we go I'm

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,400
going to do this for those of you who

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:32,880
are from the United States this is gonna

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:34,500
be like no thought of you supposed to go

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,340
back to your any calling about the

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,290
anonymization

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,290
it's one of the biggest challenges of

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,640
oversight they need to apply to make

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:53,860
illegal things how do you see that

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:55,960
working if you so you should have the

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,760
data that you need to perform the

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,010
analysis that you need to I think

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,610
there's a bit of misunderstanding about

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:06,520
how how privacy and anonymity needs to

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,140
work in these systems even Z cash for

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,840
example has what's called selective

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,490
disclosure and there could be a system

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,120
where you walk into a bank and when you

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,640
open a cryptocurrency wallet you opt in

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,380
you consent to have to give a bank

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
access to all transactions that happen

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,530
in that wallet in the same way they see

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,210
all transactions in your debit card the

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,010
difference is whether or not you can

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,960
extract money out of that wallet and

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,360
take it with you like you extract cash

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,070
from an ATM right now and do something

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,450
where then the Bennett does not

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,710
necessarily have oversight and that

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,660
could be a number of things it could be

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,100
sending our mittens overseas to where

00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,050
someone else should have jurisdictional

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,790
governance over it or it could be buying

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:46,030
a $5 lemonade and like your kids

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:48,280
baseball game but right now the way that

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,960
these systems exist there's no such

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,880
thing as the ATM thing like it's just

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,860
there's always constant

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,560
visibility and oversight so we need to

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,230
be able to put those backers in the

00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,730
other option is something like we didn't

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,810
you know I work with the Monetary

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,670
Authority of Singapore some other

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,440
governments they're creating distributed

00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,170
ledger solutions which have a central

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,220
point of trust which being bad in that

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,110
case right that they would have

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,540
visibility to all transactions all the

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,250
time it's a very different system so all

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,890
of the if you remember like the 90s

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,320
crypto Wars about like do we backdoor

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,110
everything grab keys for things all that

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,640
stuff is like vacuum force so you either

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,640
aren't architect things so that there

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,000
are like you know fire door gaps between

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,970
trust boundaries or we create a new type

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,330
of surveillance wherein somebody

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,680
that that key and it's you know once one

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,260
government has it another government

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,750
will have it so we're looking at an

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:47,200
entire new generation of cyber war

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,580
possible so I would opt into the privacy

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,590
part now and then work with the
