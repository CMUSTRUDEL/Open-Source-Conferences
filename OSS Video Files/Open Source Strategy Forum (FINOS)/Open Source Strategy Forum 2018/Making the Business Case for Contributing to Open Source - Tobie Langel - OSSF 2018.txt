Title: Making the Business Case for Contributing to Open Source

Today, pretty much all companies have embraced open source. But while they’re all keen to use open source, at lot fewer actually contribute to it.
 
And yet, there’s real value in doing so. Companies use their contribution to open source to boost recruiting (Facebook claims 75% of their new engineering recruit mention Facebook’s open source program as a key reason they accepted their offer), increase their market, build a moat around their business, or position themselves as leaders in their field.
 
In this talk, we’ll look at the different ways contributing to open source can benefit a business and become a competitive advantage. We’ll look at the open source strategies of different companies, big and small, and provide you with the knowledge to start building a business case for open source in your own company.

[Music]

00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm gonna try to project this you can't

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,130
hear me

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,570
please do say so and I think we should

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,910
get started because I have a lot of

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,369
information to share with you and we're

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,510
already running five minutes behind the

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,990
scheduled time so I'm sure you're all

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,890
familiar with that mark interesting

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,829
quote in short software in the world

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,899
witches Croats and the title of an

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,530
article he wrote in The Wall Street

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:44,340
Journal close to a decade ago at this

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,719
point we can basically describes what

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,200
people now tend to call digital

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,550
transformation but basically every

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,100
vertical of every every vertical being

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,809
either leveraging software me one where

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,469
you have incumbents in there leveraging

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:04,229
software to sustain their positions or

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:09,420
you have sort of like this one thing

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:11,369
that might get through something um so

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,040
this was mentioned in the keynote before

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,869
so those numbers of black black dot

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,040
numbers so black duck is a company that

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,840
does that scans requisite trees for

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,479
open-source software and to discover

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,850
security issues and they run about ten

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,579
to twelve hundred such scans on

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,430
companies every year essentially doing

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,100
mergers and acquisitions but also as

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,110
part of continuous integration and what

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,499
they found over the last year so these

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:50,000
are the 27

00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:54,299
is there 96% of applications that they

00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,450
check contain open source components and

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:03,569
out of out of those 57% of the codebase

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:08,580
is actually open source so you have

00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:12,810
today across the industry more well

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,480
basically every app contains open source

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,519
and an average it's more than a half of

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,030
their overall lines of code that are

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,730
open source wait so it's huge

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,730
interestingly in in FinTech the numbers

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,379
of bit smaller it's less it so it's also

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,319
around the same overall presentation

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,780
that has open source but the overall

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,819
size of open source any Trevor the tree

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:42,060
is smaller I think it's around 30% um so

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,970
I think it's good to say it's correct to

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,130
say today that not only is software

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,040
eating the world but open source is

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:57,030
feeding software so basically open

00:02:50,040 --> 00:03:00,500
source eating the world yet oh where

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,180
where as everyone is using open source

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,799
people contributing to open source and

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,489
companies contributing to open source a

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,690
much more we're um and that begs the

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:16,169
question as to well why should a company

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:20,459
contribute to open source what's the

00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:23,069
reason for that and in general when that

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,400
question is asked the kind of question

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,950
the kind of answers that come up are

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,859
sort of wishy-washy feel-good answer

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,620
such as it's for the common good or it's

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,389
paying it forward my personal favorite

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,940
which is it's the right thing to do

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:47,849
right so when you actually put those

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:51,989
reasons to contribute um on a scale they

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,620
don't hold very long once other parts of

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,080
a company

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,459
it's not bringing up reasons not to

00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,260
contribute so Vicki obviously as while

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,590
you're losing IP you're making that

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,340
public sort of like losing it as

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,620
something that you can leverage another

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,360
one that comes up as well you risk

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,360
losing your competitive advantage

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,290
there's increased risk right by working

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,330
in the open you might leak you know

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:30,150
things that you don't want to leak maybe

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:35,580
security credentials data or copyrighted

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:38,790
material or secrets well it's also

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,979
costly to actually just contribute to

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,530
open source me there's extra work

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:47,850
required and so maybe those resources

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,940
should be better use elsewhere and then

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,350
one that comes up quite often is well we

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,020
don't know how to do that we don't have

00:04:52,350 --> 00:05:01,110
the culture right it's not enough DNA so

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,350
whereas we understand today really well

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,200
the return on investment of using open

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,090
source well we don't have a good

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,650
understanding of the return on

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:18,979
investment of contributing to open

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:22,830
source so today what I want to do is

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:24,840
look at one of the benefits of open

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,000
source and basically how we can make it

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,520
business case for contributing to open

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,910
source and for this we're gonna look

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:38,479
yeah that for software companies larger

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,919
tech companies you know basically

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,400
reasons benefits of open source that

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,050
effect pretty much anyone that is doing

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,930
software which as we've seen earlier

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,919
today is pretty much every company

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:56,669
another way of looking at this is for

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,000
some companies open source is a business

00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:59,000
model

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:06,580
tech companies tend to use it at a

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:09,970
strategic level and then of the rest and

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,400
I think that is one of the key to to

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,560
open-source that we don't hear talked

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
about very often is that there's a bunch

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,500
of really nice second-order consequences

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,940
that companies can actually leverage you

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,199
know help them make the case for

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,479
contribute to open source

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,069
thanks to those alright so um we talked

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,539
a bit about this in the keynote earlier

00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,220
um

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,870
software companies that have a business

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,810
model around the open source this is

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,849
what people tend to think about when

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:44,349
they think about open source right it's

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:48,030
it's these companies so mainly companies

00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:51,250
that are well a lot of them basically

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:56,819
monetization strategies around an open

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:59,560
source project initially and whereas

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,599
these are interesting and it's great to

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,150
see that they have a lot of value and

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:08,020
that it's a it's a business that works

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,020
in lots of pieces they usually don't

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,360
really need you know anyone's help to

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,710
know why contributing to open source is

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,310
a good thing to do they just do it

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,039
that's how they started right so it's

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,279
interesting to look instead of what

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:28,569
quickly had bigger companies type

00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:31,779
companies in particular and see for

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,219
those how contribution contributing to

00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,729
open source can become a strategic

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,729
advantage

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:45,500
so one of the key reasons large

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,990
companies American sources it says it's

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,850
a strategy to commoditize their

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,800
compliments so what does that mean

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,750
basically it's yeah it's sort of the

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,570
opposite of vertical integration it's

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,390
the idea that 5000 the core of your

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,850
business is focused under the main that

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,610
depends on something else make sure that

00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,280
you monetize that something else when

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,170
you think about what composition means

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,660
for software right

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,500
open source is the alternate way to

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:22,730
commodify software and so let's look at

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:26,930
a couple of examples of that consider

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:30,350
Google for example the main focus of who

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:34,220
will obviously a search in the

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:37,400
complement to search well it's how do

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,620
you get people to search initially it

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,790
was a web browser right today it's also

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,800
more you know unsurprisingly

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:50,900
Google has invested a lot and to

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:52,490
contribute in Android from so an open

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:58,040
source browser an open source operating

00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:02,470
system similarly similarly intel on

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:06,800
their focuses manufacturing chips cpu 3

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:11,200
so i'm surprising lead again while Intel

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:17,390
is the biggest contributor to our links

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,730
so again they're using open source as a

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:24,890
way to commoditize a complement to CPUs

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:27,610
which is an operating system RedHat

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:31,130
which is actually the second biggest

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,620
contributor to Linux has also a similar

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,990
strategy it's selling services and

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,810
packaging around Linux and so it's

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,270
really

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,490
for EDS their Linux as an open source

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,240
project I mean you wouldn't imagine but

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,890
I had built on top of windows providing

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,140
service for Windows Red Hat would be

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:53,670
like this really clean company was not

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:55,770
at all the same kind of um so the last

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,750
one is an interesting one Facebook when

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,410
you think about Facebook one way of

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:07,220
looking at Facebook's core business it's

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:10,950
in data and data might maybe - well

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,020
basically provided the good user

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,420
experience for the users and then also

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,040
to be able to help advertisers target

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,120
these users really effectively and so

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,100
unsurprisingly when you think about data

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,590
you think about the complement to data

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,720
and the constant complement the data is

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:33,050
data centers right and so Facebook

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,760
launched well number of years ago now a

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,670
Open Compute Project which is basically

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,050
how to commoditize and open source

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:48,830
designs around servers and data centers

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:52,440
so this is one of the really interesting

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,420
strategy um technique that I used to

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,510
show the value of contributing to open

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,510
source to essentially companies that are

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:07,470
another common strategy which you see a

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:11,250
lot of right now is a way to unwrap

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:16,440
developers it's again not used to anyone

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:19,950
dead of developers getting developers to

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,170
like use a company has been critical to

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,940
any platform company for a long time I'm

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,740
sure you all remember the developers

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,650
developers developers and Steve long

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,410
which is also sort of dated at this

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,930
point but it's a really important

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,330
strategy if you think about cloud

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,960
computing today and the big actor of

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:42,810
clowns they were all investing heavily

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,550
in open source and why is this it's

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,260
because developers that learn how to use

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,070
of software when they're working on a

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,170
site project or prototype of something

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:57,740
will tend to want to use the same

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:59,510
software when they actually when that

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,070
project needs to scale when you're using

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:06,680
something for their company in both

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,220
cases although they're not the actual

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:13,540
buyers of the software when it moves at

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,400
a cloud scale or an enterprise sales

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,590
they're going to be heavily influencing

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,860
what the actual buyers is going to

00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:24,980
purchase so on the ramping developers

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,560
onto a platform is a very common

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,620
strategy and it's the one thing that's

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,980
the reason why Microsoft just bought

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,500
github not long ago

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,260
ym just want ready but at least one of

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,370
the key reasons it's basically to help

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,870
some in Microsoft's case to help onboard

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,870
developers on to the zero power

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:57,670
[Music]

00:12:53,459 --> 00:13:01,360
so we've briefly looked at the reasons

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:04,689
why companies whose business model is

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,540
around open source contribute and then

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:10,689
we looked at a couple wall to key

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,899
strategic reasons why companies and the

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:15,399
country we do now woman look at

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,639
something that is broader than among

00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,240
these two which I sort of like works for

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:26,369
all companies um you know which another

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,160
way of looking at it is second order

00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:31,569
basically leveraging second-order

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,649
consequences of contributing to Google

00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:36,910
tools now if there's one thing in my

00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,110
opinion that you should remember from

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,059
this pockets

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,619
the following slides that conversation

00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:48,730
I'm sure you're all familiar was that

00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:50,829
diagram so it's basically a process

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,410
diagram that says well you have an

00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:56,980
engineer in them in the middle that has

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,439
as input problems and coffee and that

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,100
output solution solutions to those

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:05,980
problems make um and as of my product

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:09,339
which is sarcasm so of course it's funny

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,129
oh but the notion of a byproduct here is

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:16,959
key and we'll come back to it later so

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:19,629
keep that in mind if we sort of make

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,879
that a bit less generic and movement to

00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:24,610
software engineering nothing much

00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,589
changes right instead of having an

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,499
engineer we have a software engineer and

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:33,879
the solution of the solution is usually

00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:36,549
in the form of code what happens though

00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:41,290
when you're thinking about that in the

00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:44,259
realm of open source so what happens

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,209
basically is instead of producing just a

00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:48,759
prototype in its proprietary cat

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,610
somewhere you're producing open source

00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,089
code which ends up in the pool of

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,089
Commons

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,580
but the bigger distinction is not here

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,529
the bigger distinction is you're no

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:08,220
longer alone as a developer who was a

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:08,220
company working on that particular side

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:14,440
and out of that out of the fact that now

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,300
in this new environment which is a multi

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,920
today home environment with people from

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,920
other companies from different cultures

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,380
there's a lot of things that can happen

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:29,560
between developers working a project

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:32,620
just conversations on IRC or a slack or

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,240
mailing lists or github missions of

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,160
course you're gonna start to get good

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:43,380
reviews um and bit by bit you're gonna

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,940
see things emerging like mentoring like

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,310
networking for example if only gonna

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:53,050
start maybe coming to conferences and

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:55,720
meeting in person and all of that if you

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,649
remember the sarcasm by-product I

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,950
mention about it's going to create

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:08,740
byproducts so these are the byproducts

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:12,370
of the interaction of the process around

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:19,890
making open-source code the contribution

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:19,890
process and there are lots and lots of

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,240
this in my opinion is really the missed

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:33,200
opportunity of not contributing to open

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,090
source today and we'll get to in details

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:41,150
I just want to sort of like go through

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:43,610
that list quickly with you and so

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:46,760
basically um what you'll see first of

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:50,000
all is improvement sort of an overall

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,430
code quality right because multiple

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,910
people contribute my project are you

00:16:52,430 --> 00:17:01,130
need you know improve documentation it's

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,570
going to label also lowering technical

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,880
depth if you contribute back to a

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:09,800
project you can avoid we can afford

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,839
globally as a company you also be able

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,939
to influence the project direction if

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,199
it's not your project in a much stronger

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,760
way than if you're just sitting on the

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,220
sidelines at the engineering level what

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,470
that's going to change is it's really

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,670
gonna put your your team's your

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,980
engineers in a much in a much an

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,200
environment where they oral a lot right

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,850
it's so they can level up technically

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,380
but they want something to level up in

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,060
terms of soft skills weight

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,520
communication everything is done in

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,390
written or maybe through presentations

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,520
and in conferences it's also a great way

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:50,600
to to keep up to date with best

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,220
practices right and the other aspect of

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,980
it is obviously that's gonna give you

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,830
access to a network of expert in that

00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,020
field through all the connections and

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,650
networking that you've done and that

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:07,460
open source project for a company in

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:09,410
itself what it does is it make it change

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,200
of the perception of the company and

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,840
makes it look like an industry leader

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,300
right which the fact though it becomes

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,460
as its influencing key projects of the

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,440
industry so it's really good for the

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,030
company's public perception and

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,080
especially its perception among the

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:28,940
dollars it also provides the company was

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,550
a talent pool all of these developer was

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,640
working

00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:35,370
on that project we have strong

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,140
connections it's a lot easier to hire

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,350
from those developers than it is from

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,940
developers in the wild you know you

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,860
actually note that they know how to do

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,720
this work because you have you've been

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,270
working with them already it built a

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,120
real friendly culture because open

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,310
source is distributed um which is great

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,660
because that allows you to access talent

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:02,820
outside of actually where you're based

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,890
it tends to reduce churn it tends to

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,470
improve the culture and morale and silo

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,700
company a company that is doing open

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:14,430
source really well it's going to be much

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,070
much better perceived than one that

00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,230
isn't

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,130
and then lastly that has really strong

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:26,460
impacts on the company's ability to

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:30,000
innovate um ability to be effective

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,950
we'll look at that in a second and also

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,100
there's a concept I'd love to talk about

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,900
the whole people half of time which is

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,930
knowledge spillover which is basically

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,110
what happens in what Silicon Valley is

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:45,300
historically known for when people from

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,430
very different companies and competing

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:52,680
companies tend to interact on a regular

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:54,480
basis in like information leaks in ways

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,610
that are not damaging to the companies

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,170
but that basically help innovation

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,920
prevents people from making the same

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:03,720
mistakes across different companies so

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:09,860
we actually now was learning to have

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,860
data as to how those byproducts improve

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,390
basically are beneficial to companies

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,130
contributing to a business um so this is

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:21,840
a study that came out not long ago

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:25,110
actually by Frank Nago you know what he

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,690
did is he looked at the Linux country

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,490
contributes to

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,170
companies that were contributing to

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,840
links and copies

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,350
well using Linux but not contributing to

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:40,180
it so three writers in what he was able

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,800
to prove is that there's actually a

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,650
companies that contributes by twice as

00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,810
efficient as companies that don't so

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,090
it's it's it's not like five or ten

00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:52,520
percent more right it's a hundred

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,620
percent more efficient which one you're

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,800
thinking about it is illogical they know

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,560
the innards of the software that they're

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,800
relying on better than anyone else right

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,020
um you know as when those abstraction

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,290
tends to leak so knowing what's on the

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,020
under the link underway using is

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,910
actually generally very usable and the

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,160
second aspect is obviously they have a

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:22,370
huge network of people to tap into if

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:24,350
they bump into issues another way that

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:30,530
those byproducts are really useful and

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:32,240
is for hiring purposes so Facebook now a

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,330
number of years ago launched a really

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,000
big initiative internally to become much

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,980
more open to open source and open to

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,540
contributing audiences and that's what

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,880
led at a later stage to releasing react

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,230
in the success that we have today and

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,390
what they did is they around some

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,570
numbers um once they started the Soviets

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,730
was program for new hires and it turns

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,000
out that even for company like Facebook

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,690
that was at that time was just after IPO

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,140
or just had IPO that was a really hot

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:08,540
tech company it turns out that having an

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,970
open source program that was well known

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:14,390
and well respected in the industry was

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,940
he formed number of hires seventy-five

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,740
percent of them naturally said yeah

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,220
Facebook's open source program had been

00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:25,010
a key aspect of them accepting the offer

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,600
so imagine what that can do for a

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,790
company that doesn't have some of the

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,790
cachet of Facebook right Oh

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,950
my present it was the small case study

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:41,370
which i think is interesting trivia

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,130
though which you might know as a company

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,160
that basically compares prices of hotels

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:51,780
and lets you buy the the cheapest room

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:54,450
in a given destination this cited two

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:58,350
years ago to sponsor through open

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:00,150
collective the webpack project and the

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,850
reason they did that is that they were

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,860
relying on webpack a lot of work and

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,280
they did not have the resources to

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,320
actually contribute to it in terms of

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,330
engineering resources but they had the

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,150
money to do so so they put the money

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,810
where their mouth was and webpack a

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:23,430
hundred thousand dollars to pay for web

00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:26,460
pack developers to improve it you don't

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,620
have to incur they discussed it they

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,080
were interviewed by web pack maintainers

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,790
to sort of discuss it you know out of

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,300
that discussion came those two boats

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:38,220
which a they were super happy about the

00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,530
work that had been done right so the

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,300
money was a super good investment but

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,670
there was again this interesting

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,550
by-product a side effect of their

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,410
investment which was that because of

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,110
their involvement as a sponsor of that

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:55,440
project they became known in the

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,750
front-end JavaScript land in Europe as a

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,350
hot place to go work too because it was

00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,390
an open source and modern company to

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,760
join and so they started having lots of

00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,130
people that were really keen on joining

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,500
a company you know hired a bunch of

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:16,080
those so that's a another really

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,920
compelling example of how bike hubs can

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:23,120
actually be a really sound what really

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,120
helped make the case

00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:32,340
so we now have a whole set of arguments

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,679
to help make our case great tip the

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:39,289
balance in favor of open source you know

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:43,860
the question is whether we can actually

00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:46,500
also help decrease trim the weight of

00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,500
arguments against so we won't have the

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,779
time to look at all of them but I want

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,490
to look at to which in making a critical

00:24:51,779 --> 00:25:00,390
one is lost competitive advantage this

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,240
is something that in practice is often

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,679
not true

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,090
of course no one is like no one is

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,980
suggesting that you should open source

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:13,529
like the key the key software that

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,570
really makes a difference but most of

00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:18,029
the time your competition right

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,490
companies that can compete against you

00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,770
I'm not going to be companies dead or

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,649
sitting on the sidelines waiting for you

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:28,529
to open source stuff and copy it that is

00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:31,500
not how competition was you know in the

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:33,090
this is an overused like both I agree

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,399
but it's a good a good one maybe you

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,690
don't want to escape what why do you

00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,970
want to skate where the puck is going to

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,520
be and your competitors do realize that

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,720
you should be worried about I'm not the

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,679
ones that are going to be waiting for

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,350
you to open source stuff and again

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,600
there's an old example of that that is

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:58,440
interesting which is from omec

00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:00,390
Kalugin an ex-kgb Spy that said well you

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,130
know the key to me was able to get all

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:08,029
of these all of them like IBM and from

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:11,130
all of the corporate swagging was doing

00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:13,380
back during the Cold War but the problem

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:17,010
was by the time they actually figured

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,720
out like what to do was it and how to

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,419
implement this stuff that they had

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,600
stolen five six seven years have gone by

00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:29,370
and the West was onto something really

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,440
different so it's not like it's it's

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:34,289
nothing to be scared about

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,300
of course you have to be to balance

00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,430
things but like

00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,430
we're gonna lose competitiveness it's

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,640
usually not as terrible then the second

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,560
one I'm gonna look at does the last IP

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,440
and I wanted me to you this crummy hotel

00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,830
because I think it's an important young

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,900
locale is Facebook's head of artificial

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,790
intelligence

00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:00,150
he recently wrote an article in Business

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:02,520
Insider describing how he had maintained

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,340
a position in a role and New York

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:10,530
University as a chair of a ia+

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:13,230
led facebook's a my organization at the

00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:16,290
same time from an intellectual property

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:19,350
perspective and so what he says goes

00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:22,370
down to this as in today's world a

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,650
fast-paced Internet services deployment

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,590
owning IP owning intellectual property

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,960
has become considerably less important

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,840
than turning research results into

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,950
innovative products as quickly as

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:41,310
possible and deploying them at scale so

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:45,870
the valium IP itself is no longer really

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:49,110
critical what matters is how you can

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:53,250
turn research results like what you find

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:55,950
out into products and how best can you

00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:59,480
do that if you think about it is was

00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:02,550
teams that are super efficient you know

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,410
composed of top talent okay so all of

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,420
those really interesting byproducts of

00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,090
open source that we're talking about

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,630
before suddenly become the area where

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,760
the real value is and there's more

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:18,750
research today that shows that actually

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:22,800
it is really how efficient in how good

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:25,740
your teams are leveraging changing

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,840
conditions leveraging software to deal

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,160
with changing business conditions that

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,530
are going to make a difference

00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,340
much more than affording a bunch of

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:38,720
patents or a bunch of copyright in

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,720
Europe sort of your asset

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:50,180
so yes sorry now that we've shrunk all

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,760
of these while some of these I didn't

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:56,060
have time to go over all of them but

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,450
some of these arguments against

00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:02,270
contributing to open source what I

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:06,950
wanted to quickly make you consider

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:10,670
before moving on to Q&A is that all of

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,080
these arguments not sorry not all of

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:17,390
these arguments are gonna be valid to

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,740
your case depending on your company some

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:23,630
of those arguments that kind of madame

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:25,370
or um and maybe you know IP can be more

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,570
critical if you're in an environment

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:31,280
where there's a lot of pathogens so what

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,940
you really need to do is take all of

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,700
these

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:39,020
well weights these Lego bricks and built

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:41,090
the case that works for your company and

00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,510
when you do that what you want to do is

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:47,960
you want to focus on business efforts

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:50,690
you want to be reasonable that is if

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,500
your company just but after huge patent

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:56,030
portfolio if you try to open source all

00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,360
the things while probably you're gonna

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:02,150
have a hard time and what you want to do

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,070
is show empathy to the needs of other

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,460
people in the organization that's

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:09,380
critical um developers tend to not

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,200
really consider what lawyers are there

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,360
for and similarly lawyers tend to forget

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,210
that developers also are there to

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,010
innovate and move quickly and so showing

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,660
empathy and understanding to how these

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,060
two organizations and company function

00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:27,560
it's gonna really get you a lot further

00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:30,110
than not doing so and also maybe start

00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,240
small right in for small ones maybe try

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,970
to find a way to open source of single

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,560
project or story I don't know well now

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,060
many people to contribute to something

00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,800
that you really care about that is not

00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,140
where most of you intellectual

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,940
properties and remember I think

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,390
is to remember that this is really a

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,460
mindset shift there's this time here

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,830
that open source is sort of like this

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,630
nice thing to do contribution overtones

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,520
it's like nice and so it sort of like

00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,010
KBS you know people look for the common

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,290
good well it's a complete length of tip

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,140
to really see it as one of the key

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:13,030
reasons why tech companies are making

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:16,270
such a dent in the world today so just

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,670
for the other kicks I created sort of

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,400
like one of those for what a patent

00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,260
troll would do right so for patent troll

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,450
obviously the only thing that matters is

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,620
the IP and so it would be ridiculous for

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,650
them to start contributing to open

00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:40,110
source all right I'm done

00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:40,110
your questions oh I'm sorry in the back

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,910
so the question for the microphone is

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:02,440
whether might have any comments about

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:04,720
Microsoft opening opening about 16,000

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,490
of its patents too though I don't know

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,900
the mechanism to the Linux Foundation or

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,040
something like this is a fair I'm not

00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:14,080
too sure what if you don't work

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:16,300
um well I mean in my opinion it's time

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,310
to pretty much what I've discussed here

00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:23,260
which is they see a lot of value

00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:27,310
Microsoft is betting on the cloud wait

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:29,290
um to get people to army of people to

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,060
the cloud as I mentioned before its

00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,440
strategic for them that's why they

00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,670
bought github strategic for them to

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,840
convince developers that there are a

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:45,790
good open source citizen um so suddenly

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,160
the value of those patents um are much

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,530
how much while they're much lighter if

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,640
the value is much less than it used to

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,260
be when

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,040
Microsoft's business strategy was

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,540
different today it is probably seen as a

00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,100
very good sign for developer perspective

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:03,000
and there's probably other business

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:06,570
reason out of to open up these habits

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,350
and to make it possible for Microsoft to

00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:13,600
be perceived as a really good actor in

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:31,030
that space it might be and that's that's

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:42,970
the key reason yeah so that's what will

00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:44,650
comment than a question basically yes if

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:48,580
that's a question then the answer is yes

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:51,400
um if something if you don't open source

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,309
something that is not to yours you know

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,350
strategy someone else is going to come

00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:59,620
and do it better than you and gonna open

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:06,370
source it right it's a it so yeah that's

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:08,230
that's how it works so yes my background

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,909
let's go found without fresco actively

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,889
in apt runnable so I've lived in open

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,710
source software for some time now I

00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,710
think a couple of points one is lots of

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:19,119
IP as always the one you know I've ever

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,669
encountered that is the biggest barrier

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,750
and small companies it's a CEO who is

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:24,820
emotionally attached to their

00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,649
differentiation or whatever that is the

00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,850
barrier you need to educate them the

00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,710
real problem with bigger companies is

00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,720
the legal department you need the legal

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,149
department that these events to actually

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,950
you know understand what it is so that's

00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:37,370
one thing is you know preaching to

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,260
converted

00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:44,180
it's getting the legal people here the

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,560
other comment on the sort of benefit is

00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,670
the biggest benefit I mean after what

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,620
you've talked about as a strategic

00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,630
benefit absolutely agree with all of

00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,430
that there's tactical benefit in that

00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,750
it's an emotional thing if you're

00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,940
working with developers if you're

00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,410
contributing thing there's a personal

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,540
relation there's a trust there's there's

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,610
a willingness to give more to those

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,860
people to contribute so I know my guys

00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,180
do more for the people that contribute

00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,550
than anyone so if you hit a problem

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,930
you're going to get faster response if

00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,270
you've been contributing than if you've

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,190
been a bystander I think that that

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,930
tactical you know I've got a problem as

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,390
you say it's the speed of iteration of

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,550
getting new innovation out you just want

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:23,460
to smooth out any blocks to to that

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,230
innovation and tie him with you by

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,540
contributing that emotional tie it's

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,820
really really important absolutely I

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,420
think that falls perfectly into those

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:36,960
sort of by product category in the sense

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,480
that yeah when you when you build in

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,610
network which is what happens when you

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,570
contribute to open source then you can

00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,570
tap into the network when you need to

00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,570
yes

00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:41,740
so the question is around the extra

00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,970
amount of work that needs to happen to

00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:49,750
open source existing software and yeah

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:54,430
that is a real problem my answer to that

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,740
is maybe don't start was open sourcing

00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,540
something that is that big and it's

00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,100
probably a lot easier to actually start

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,770
building in the open from the get-go

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,860
right I would recommend that as a

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,020
strategy so maybe yeah don't don't start

00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,410
with this huge project that you know has

00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:15,340
a whole bunch of issues and instead

00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:16,900
focus on small ones um you know and I

00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:22,300
wanted to come back on this legal

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:24,670
argument I think yes absolutely having

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,650
legal in the room is critical so I I

00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:30,220
gave up my talk about this really

00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:35,140
recently am at the Linux of open source

00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:37,930
7 and Edinburgh um I think that people

00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,890
are really scared about legal especially

00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:42,370
people that are not lawyers

00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,320
um info matrons dealing with lawyers for

00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,930
a number of years they're actually much

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,540
nicer than

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,099
no no we um they tend to have a really

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,720
different way of thinking about problems

00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:57,400
and people that come more from the

00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:00,460
engineering side do um but when you

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,290
actually start when you when you show

00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,080
empathy and way to attune to those

00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,800
differences it's actually surprisingly

00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,200
easier to get stuff done especially if

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,859
you start showing them what they can get

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,440
out of it um and they usually is that a

00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,820
legal team has to handle that if you

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,010
have for example a really good open

00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,140
source contributing policy they will no

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,000
longer have to to care about and it

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,430
won't be just done and automated for

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,080
them and that will free their time for

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,480
example to focus on things that are much

00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,849
more apparent to the company um so

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,530
that's one example it's sort of outside

00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:37,810
of the discovery process and the other

00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,089
one is if you really start tying things

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,740
to business goals and business outcomes

00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:42,400
and it's so much easier to make those

00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,650
decisions

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,530
wait you can again if you can really

00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,150
strongly make the business case for why

00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,460
it's important to open-source something

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:55,180
then actually doing the work to make

00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,609
sure that you're not of leaking stuff

00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,390
that you're not supposed to leak of

00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:02,230
creating my abilities

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,490
it's it's an easier sell right so to

00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,030
answer your question I would say start

00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:08,830
small um and then yeah make sure that

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:12,760
the business value is really done well

00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:15,470
on this available I think no sorry after

00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,050
thank you so much for your time

00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:21,539
[Applause]
