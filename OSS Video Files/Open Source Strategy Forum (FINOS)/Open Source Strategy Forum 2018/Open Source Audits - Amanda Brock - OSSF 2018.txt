Description: 
	Speaker: Amanda Brock, European Representative, Open Invention Network
Presentation: Open Source Audits

Open Source Audits: Good open source software and license management is an essential part of any fintech compliance programme. Where do open source audits fit into this programme? This session will delve into why, when and how audits should be undertaken and consider the consequences, remediation and go forward from an audit. With a practical approach, the session should enable you to understand who should be involved in an audit, and what their roles and activities will be and the outputs that may be achieved.

[Music]

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:16,020
so good afternoon I'm Amanda Brock and

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:19,230
I'm going to spend somewhere between 30

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,470
and 50 minutes with you talking about

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,960
open source audits I didn't expect the

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,670
audience would be quite as big as it is

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,740
because you've got a very dry topic

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,300
midway through the afternoon on the

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,410
first day of conference when people are

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,070
starting to get to know each other

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,710
networking but I sort of planned on this

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,149
basis and expected that we would

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,950
probably have more of a collaborative

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,809
discussion or you guys are going to fall

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,300
asleep if I just stand here and talk at

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,809
you for the next half hour or so so what

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,879
I've got is a slide deck that I'll take

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,829
you through but I'm really happy if we

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,899
start stop if people have their own

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,420
views or thoughts or even some advice

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,789
for me if you've done more audits than I

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,800
have in this room just to start with

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,799
who's worked on an open source audit

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,000
before yeah there's per half and half

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,400
that's kind of what I thought it would

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,040
be like so to explain why I'm the person

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,140
talking to you about this I'm a

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,119
technology lawyer I've been a lawyer for

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,100
a quarter of a century and you get to be

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,770
the first audience I've spoken to since

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,799
I hit that landmark in my career which

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,180
is very very aging but even a quarter of

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,579
a century where I've mostly practiced

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,619
technology law isn't enough to really

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,530
qualify you to do anything that's very

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,200
specific about open source and the the

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,150
thing that and most ways qualifies me to

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,579
do anything around open source is that I

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,310
spent five years working for a UK

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,659
company called canonical and canonical

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,119
distributes their open source operating

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,180
system and various adjuncts to Auburn -

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,420
and I joined them in 2000 a early in

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,810
2008 and it was quite for a lawyer

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,360
different experience I don't know if

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,430
there are many roles in Europe or in the

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,790
world even where lawyers get to be

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,840
totally integrated into a project

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,330
frankly because most projects can't

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,510
afford lawyers to come in join them and

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,710
be part of that project day to day so I

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,230
had a real baptism

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,570
fired joining canonical which is a

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,850
commercial entity but that stage was

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,500
finding its feet and I set up the legal

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,390
infrastructure and the legal team there

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,290
and managed that for the five years I

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,650
was there and what I found was that

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,020
gradually over a few months I began to

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,790
unlearn what I've been taught as a

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,970
lawyer and I remember I was a technology

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,500
lawyer and I wasn't just moving into an

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,240
open source environment where I thought

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,830
I knew what open source men but was

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,670
really going to be given the baptism of

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,810
fire I also was moving from a

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,510
traditional technology environment to

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,460
agile and lean development so lots and

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,040
lots of things as a lawyer I doll was

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,230
taken for granted like certainty a nice

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,170
specification at the back of a contract

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,010
all became totally redundant and I had

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,660
to learn ways of making that work in an

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,910
environment where if I was wrong

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:17,670
somebody would start speaking to me with

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:19,530
I a nal but you're wrong and I would

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,300
have to be able to justify any position

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,640
that I thought I uncanonical or have

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,440
been to ought to take with respect to

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,720
anything and everything and that's a

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,500
very different way of working for

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,360
lawyers getting used to the openness of

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,880
a community and people just going off

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,650
and doing things was kind of strange to

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,960
the first couple of times that happened

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,970
you know the reaction is WTF how on

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,380
earth did somebody just go and do that

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,320
who's controlling them where is their

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,030
line manager and actually it's a matter

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,100
of unlearning the legal stuff to

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,760
understand collaboration and freedom and

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,090
how that can be harnessed in positive

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,850
ways through the use of governance and

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,650
project specific parameters so that

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,290
everybody knows what the role is ought

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,790
to be what's okay what's not okay and

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,470
how to ask for forgiveness later so for

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,450
me canonical was a bit of a baptism of

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,670
fire but I absolutely loved being in

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,650
that development community because I

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,690
spent my days with really really smart

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,880
people doing really clever things that

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,460
they thought was for the best they were

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,630
trying to change the world but at least

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,260
we thought we were changing the world

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,300
and one of the reasons I laughed wasn't

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,670
that in like open-source anymore it was

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,360
that I started to get a bit bored and I

00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:40,450
started to get bored gradually as I had

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,750
the same conversation repetitively and

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,430
at that point in time open source wasn't

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,560
really something that was commercially

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,740
adopted across all corpus there's been a

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,480
huge shift in the last five to ten years

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,550
and how corporates behave about open

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,760
source how they contribute and how they

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,310
adopt and I would say it's an

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,290
inevitability but at the time it didn't

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,450
feel like that and the conversation I

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,970
was having day-in day-out was speaking

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,070
to the legal departments of big

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,100
international technology or hardware

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,720
companies and working with them to get

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,850
them to a point of understanding about

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,040
open source so that could accept things

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,790
like our contract terms or our licensing

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,620
decisions and over a period of time I

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,110
really really got fed up with having

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,480
those parrot-like conversations so my

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,580
tact was to go out to conferences that

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,380
didn't involve lawyers and to try and

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,650
speak to the technology people and the

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,300
commercial people and convince them or

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,770
even just explain to them the things

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,410
that their lawyers were getting upset

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,570
about and why the lawyers were upset

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,610
because I was constantly being told that

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,840
the legal teams were a blocker to

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,340
open-source being used in organizations

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,290
sort of moving on from that I think

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,720
there's been a mind shift as I said in

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,490
the adoption and use of open-source and

00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,590
that it's not that there weren't always

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,580
some major companies the IBM's of this

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,500
world who were big open-source users

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,840
it's more that it's become the norm and

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,120
it's become the norm as projects have

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,370
expanded away from core Linux and you

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,410
see even if you track an organization

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,720
like the Linux Foundation how the

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,120
projects have moved further right so you

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,430
get away from the operating systems into

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,650
the automotive sector for example and

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:30,010
then perhaps from automotive into mobile

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:31,510
or into financial or powerin energy

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,190
which is one of the big things where

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,070
we're seeing open-source being adopted

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,430
knife so I think it is now an

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,770
inevitability and we understand that

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,750
and source is going to be used and the

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,480
question is how do we use it what do we

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,510
do and I think for most corporates the

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,280
issue is going to be what their open

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,990
source policy is and whether or not they

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,850
have compliance and that's what puts

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,750
people off turns them off and on from

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,490
open source when I left canonical I

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,440
still do some consultancy around open

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,600
source but I did a lot of legal work for

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,670
companies and individuals who were in

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,900
projects on open source and it was kind

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,460
of difficult and it was difficult

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,710
because the companies as I've already

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,380
said didn't understand what was going on

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,290
and you needed to get everybody to sort

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,090
a collaborative place now one of the

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,790
ways of doing that is to sit down and

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,770
draft out your scope in your policy what

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,360
is it that we want to do how are we

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,700
going to do it and you get into a sort

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,170
of chicken and egg situation where it's

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,120
never clear whether you should start

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,150
with a policy around open source or an

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,810
audit so they asked me today to talk to

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,190
you guys the sort of ramune I was given

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,830
was if I was talking to a corporate

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,230
entity why would you want to do an audit

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,060
so what's an audit for you why would you

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,540
do it how do you do it and what do you

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,060
expect to achieve from that so for me an

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,190
open source audit is a way of creating a

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,330
housekeeping around open source that is

00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,120
probably better than you're going to

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,710
have in your proprietary environment

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,140
it's a way of discovering what your

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,310
codebase actually is looking at anything

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,230
that's been undisclosed and that

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,760
codebase actually is a starter you're

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,770
going to be scoping out what the

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,640
codebase is if it's a repository if it's

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,440
multiple repositories and once you've

00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,750
got that codebase working out whether

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:24,030
there are license issues compliance

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:26,490
issues etc but camonte in more detail so

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,640
why would you have an open source audit

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,990
any thoughts

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,820
has anybody who's done one had a

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,980
particular reason for doing one you're

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,380
probably not like to answer all the

00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:43,650
answers licensing okay so legals

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,360
checking your IPR okay so having gone

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,340
from canonical where I didn't really do

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,960
audits because we didn't need to because

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,310
it was our whole business and the issues

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,760
that came up there were the ones that

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,200
other companies are date

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,630
issues where other companies order

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,150
issues I think there are a bunch of

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,780
reasons why you order it and the first

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,430
one is good hygiene and when I talk

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,000
about good hygiene I talk about

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,770
governance and the norms and the rights

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,960
of open-source compliance and governance

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,750
so everybody wants to have their

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,790
licenses in order everybody wants to

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,740
know that a software is usable by them

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,930
in the way that they want to use it and

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,100
that the distribution that they'll

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,270
undertake isn't going to cause any

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,950
problems so as a matter of course having

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,070
that good hygiene you would think would

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,900
be the main reason to have an audit but

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:37,120
it's not been my experience what I found

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:39,820
is that money is what focuses minds and

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,040
has focused most of my clients to have

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,690
an open-source audit and it will be

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,270
something like they're going to go

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:51,190
through an IPO they're going to take

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:54,060
investment or they want to do some other

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,070
form of borrowing or market

00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:01,060
capitalization work and in order to have

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,220
that signed off what they generally find

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,220
is that they need to give the city or

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,650
the investor some form of waring to your

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,210
promise that their open source software

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,690
has been properly handled and properly

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,550
managed and is compliant so I've found

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,770
that the financial arrangements tend to

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,210
be the main trigger thinking about this

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,180
sector and actually I used to work with

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,370
one of you rob and I worked together on

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,020
a mobile phone company or any mobile

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:32,500
phone company on mobile financial

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:35,680
services for a year or two and we looked

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,380
for our sins at AML and kyc and other

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,470
regulatory matters in financial services

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,520
across 12 emerging markets back then so

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,740
it was a lot of fun in the wild East I

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,210
think in this sector what you'll see

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,190
more and more is not so much the

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,440
litigation or legal issues the good

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,900
license seeing the IP issues that will

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,830
promote or prompt you to have an audit

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,570
but rather the regulatory issues and I

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,100
guess this talk will sort of bring

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,860
together a number of different talks

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,540
that I've been to today

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,190
I don't if any of you sat in Andrew

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,450
Katz's talk this morning where he was

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,800
talking about open chain which is a

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,110
attempt to achieve a compliance

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,120
standards through a specification and

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,740
some training they've created a

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,360
curriculum around training and what

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,800
makes a good open source product with

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,950
good hygiene that sort of he was talking

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,280
in that talk about method and there

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,200
financial regulators across borders

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,730
pushing people to have standards and to

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,460
have compliance in their very software

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,400
code base so actually I think that will

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,110
increasingly as we see the adoption of

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,370
open source move more and more into the

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:54,360
FinTech area be a reason for audits so

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,530
how do you go about an audit again I was

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,320
talking down to Council about this

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,180
before today and one of the things that

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,310
I sort of skipped over was the start

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,500
point in the start point I think is

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,300
probably really crucial so you start by

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,620
scoping out what it is you want to do

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,330
you should do with any project but one

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,460
of the things that he was sort of

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,950
encouraging me to share with you is

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,390
reviewing what's already there so often

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,550
what you'll find is that there will be

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,140
some form of open source policy whether

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,480
it's well advised or not as another

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,090
thing but there will have been some

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,340
practice some behavior that your DevOps

00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,410
team will have used over a period of

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,720
time that shouldn't just be dismissed

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,520
out of hand and it will also give you an

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,130
opportunity to understand the sort of

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,690
tone of the way the organization works

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,330
and how they want to pull this together

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,710
so if you're sitting in an organization

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,920
like canonical where everybody's in

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,210
jeans and t-shirts you pro-poor have to

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,400
watch which names they use or another I

00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,830
worked for a gaming company where I did

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,200
their open source audit and policy for

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,600
them they're very much on a very

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,250
informal basis so they do want rules and

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,840
regulations but they don't want to seem

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,370
very prescriptive with the developers

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,500
and how they contribute and highly

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,000
managed open source whereas when you

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,530
look at some of the big corporates you

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,960
might find that you have to work in a

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,160
slightly different way that whilst the

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,550
development community within that

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,290
organization will will behave in a way

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,070
that follows development norms the

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,600
language that

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,610
used and the way that things are

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,830
described may well be very different so

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,500
sitting dining understanding the tone of

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,980
where the organization's going

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,630
understanding if there's anything

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,660
specific that's happened in that

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:34,080
organization that's drawn a reason for

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,020
the the audit or the attempt to tidy up

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,340
the open source software it's sort of

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,220
getting those parameters is very

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,890
important but also working out who it is

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,320
that's going to be in that team now from

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,300
the in-house team you definitely need

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,370
technologists and you definitely need

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,080
legal it may be that you're not big

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,790
enough to have legal but I think if you

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,710
you're gonna go through an order you may

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,330
well have your own legal advisors even

00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,010
if it's an external counsel you bring in

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,810
and one of the things that I would

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,100
caution you about is making sure that

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,560
you've got the right expertise

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,450
particularly around the legal area there

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,840
aren't actually that many lawyers who

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,220
really understand open source and

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,990
frankly anybody who's in it knows the

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,120
rest of the lawyers so if it's somebody

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,430
who we don't all know the name of at

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,980
least then you're probably not getting

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,350
the right advice and what I find with

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,360
friends who are open source legal

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,790
practitioners is that they will

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,750
regularly be asked to go and do audits

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,190
or to work on a draft policy but you

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,080
they may not be asked directly by a

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,790
company they may actually be asked by a

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,770
major law firm because they don't have

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,480
that skill set internally within the law

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,860
firm to do that kind of work and we

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,110
don't feel comfortable with it so the

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,570
light-sport outsource what I suppose

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,310
there's quite a niche expertise the

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,900
second thing I'd caution there is to

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,850
make sure you've got the right decision

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,180
makers in the room because it's terribly

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,080
easy to end up with well-intentioned

00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,520
people who actually can't make decisions

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,950
and you might want to go back and look

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,500
at the internal documents of any existed

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,760
and see where your starting point is so

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,790
I've worked on audits where the

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,350
company's policy has been no GPL but

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,940
then the reality when you've sat down

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,970
and looked at the code bases it's full

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,370
of GPL I've also worked for companies

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,840
were and it's sort of classic you go

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,160
into the room to sit and talk to them

00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,200
about how they're going to manage open

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,560
source and the development team sits on

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,150
one side the legal team sits on another

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,220
and the commercial guys sort of float

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,819
around at the back but everybody split

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,129
into their skill set or the

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:36,639
Seve skillset and when you ask the same

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:38,169
company same organization the same

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,449
question across those different

00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:44,079
functions the answer can be so so

00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:45,939
different so I've asked do you have any

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,919
open source in your organization and

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:49,299
seen lawyer say no absolutely none

00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,519
because it's completely against our

00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:52,899
company policy and the developers have

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,729
just laughed because they've never had

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,709
that conversation in a room with their

00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:59,859
lawyers before and actually their

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:02,739
codebase is full of it so I think it's

00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:05,169
important to have somebody who if they

00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,989
themselves don't have the power to make

00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:10,689
that decision can easily access and get

00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,879
a speedy response and audits can be done

00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:14,859
in a very short period of time I did one

00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,769
for a company that was being sold to a

00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:19,269
us and three days and basically I worked

00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,639
with their engineering team for three

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,289
days and what I wasn't asleep

00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,179
I was either on the phone to them or

00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:27,819
going through spreadsheets and lists of

00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,789
software and reading licenses normally

00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:32,709
you won't get somebody with that sort of

00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:34,149
urgency around the process so if I

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,319
needed a decision I could phone straight

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,639
into the main board because they really

00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,709
wanted to be sold and they needed this

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,909
warranty that's not normally how it

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,069
works you normally have to go back

00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:43,720
through a process of approvals so I

00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:45,369
think it's really important to sort of

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,259
try and work out where you think there

00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:49,839
are going to be questions and what those

00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:52,779
are going to be and who the approvers

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,639
will be rather so when you start the

00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,439
order it's very important also to

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,259
understand which code bases you're going

00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:01,539
to look at which repositories and I've

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:04,769
put a few different names and Flexera

00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,769
Jeff's in the room

00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:12,399
pathology is the only one there that's

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,279
not a proprietary service but you

00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:16,839
probably need to start with the tool and

00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,360
you need to have worked out what your

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,809
code base is and run that tool on the

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,250
code base now feel free to jump in if

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,899
you're going to tell me I'm wrong but

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,850
the way that I've seen this work is

00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:30,039
you'll start by running a tool given to

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,080
you by the proprietary company that will

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,179
give you an idea of the size of the job

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,799
they think they've got and they will

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,169
then give you a price to do the work for

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,299
you and we'll come in a minute to what

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:44,770
the work actually is and what the

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:47,440
outputs from it are what I've seen

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,410
is that when you are doing these audits

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,920
depending on your reason for it

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:55,990
pathology may be discounted because the

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,110
and again very clearly depends on your

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,550
goal the end that you need to achieve

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,220
from many of these is to give the

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,390
warranty that I mentioned and we'll talk

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,370
at the very end about what the

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,350
warranties you can give and may give are

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,570
but when you give something like that

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,540
they may well want to attach it back to

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,240
a commercial product and to somehow

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,030
qualify or promote the warranty based on

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,010
that so what you may find that I

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,320
actually will require a specific product

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,940
or the look for a state of the art or

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,760
state of the industry-standard from you

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,760
and those so once you you get that um

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,420
that bit of code run against your

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,930
repository you're going to get some

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,640
output

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,250
now this is one companies this is black

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,320
ducks and it's just a drop from one of

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,360
their projects I couldn't use any of the

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,510
ones that I've worked on because they're

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,950
all under confidentiality and I can't

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,030
disclose I'm scared that I'd get

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,280
something wrong and you'd be able to

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,230
work out whose it was so when you look

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,050
at something like this it gives you a

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,850
very good breakdown of what's

00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,470
undisclosed in your codebase what's

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,980
disclosed but perhaps you didn't

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:06,670
understand the licensing on these

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,850
reports tend to come in fancy UX is now

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,710
where you can have a nice set of

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,560
information the data can be cut many

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,870
different ways and the dashboard and

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,340
then you're going to use that just to be

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,660
fair of Poots flex area and at this

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,280
point as opposed to black dot you're

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,900
going to use that to work through the

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,750
document that's been delivered to you

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,430
and to analyze what the issues around

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:32,020
that code are so obviously you're gonna

00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:35,110
start by prioritizing your actions these

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,180
are summaries I can get the whole thing

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,610
on there of what flex area will give you

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,350
as priorities one to four priorities

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,240
five and six are left to be defined by

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,740
the organization which goes back to your

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,710
initial kickoff and what it is you're

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,350
trying to achieve and I think these are

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,810
probably quite similar across all of the

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,140
providers where are you going to start

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:58,300
by looking at the the key concerns first

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,690
of all and the key concerns

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,910
to be where you have a viral or copyleft

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,560
type license such as GPL in your

00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,410
codebase and what the impact of that

00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,220
will be if you've got those kind of

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:14,380
licenses how they interact with other

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,300
software and Andrew again this morning

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,790
was talking about those interactions and

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,930
the risks that you might have I think

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,500
tomorrow Jelena's going to do an overall

00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,450
introduction for quite a long

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,180
presentation on open source generally

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,340
we're I'm sure she'll cover exactly what

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,960
those licenses mean and how the

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,210
interaction and viral effect can work

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,610
but you tend to start by looking at

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,380
these priorities based on the types of

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,780
license so you copy laughs then you move

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,920
into commercial then permissive and what

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:47,110
I've often seen is that you have code in

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,820
there that may come up as a prior to

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,440
wonnum need to be dealt with but

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,170
actually when you sit down and talk

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,330
about what that code does it's not

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,360
particularly relevant anymore and often

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,430
you can start by clearing out your your

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,470
license priority ones by looking at the

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,900
functionality of the code and removing

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,760
things so you can actually strip out

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,140
quite a lot from the repositories where

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,060
the codes just been sitting around for

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,270
years on end without being used or not

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,890
being used anymore yes sure yeah

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,360
absolutely in fact don't just ask

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,780
questions give me an opinion or a

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,780
suggestion

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,580
absolutely so one of the things before

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,110
you came into the room we talked about

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,760
with scoping the project at the

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,620
beginning and I haven't spent a lot of

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
time going through a policy yet so I

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,640
want to come to that at the end but

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,440
those policy decisions this is not the

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,230
one way of doing it this is an example

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,120
this has flex areas priorities yeah yeah

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,410
no no this is an example there's lots of

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,880
ways to skin a cat and I've put that

00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,020
this is flex areas because the last

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
couple of slides were actually black

00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,910
duck and I wanted to be fair and not

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,650
particularly recommend any one product

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,090
but this is the way they've chosen to

00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,950
run through it and it's not dissimilar

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,320
from what I've seen anywhere else are

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,730
there there are nuances you might want

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,080
to start with commercial licenses

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,880
because this was supposed to be a check

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,410
of your open source and you might want

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,910
to start with false positives because if

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,560
you're getting a commercial license on

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,110
an open source check you're going to

00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,690
question that so you don't have to do it

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,670
in any particular order but generally

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,200
I've seen that copyleft licenses and

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,360
commercial come up whether that's wanted

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,910
to up to the organization and its goals

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,020
what I find is then when you start to

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,760
work through this you make your

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,320
decisions about what you can remove how

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,000
the software interacts and whether

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,340
there's anything technical you can do

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,170
and work back and forwards between the

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,560
legal parison and the technologists

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,540
looking for solutions I'm going to flick

00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,250
on from this but I'll come back I've put

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,160
four slides in here that I may come back

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,320
to but I only wanted to raise a very

00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,030
high level which is that when we're

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,890
talking about open source licenses

00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,940
generally you're talking about a license

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:02,230
that fits the OS sized definition I've

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,670
heard a couple of things and they're to

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,440
explain what copyleft the viral effect

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,940
and permissive are I don't know if we'll

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,110
have time to really go through that and

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:14,200
jelena will cover it tomorrow the slides

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,490
got a bit funny anyway so the the key

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,930
things that you're going to look at

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,020
there are how you resolve those issues

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:22,870
based on those priorities and I think

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,400
that you can split or I you can start by

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,580
working through priorities one to four

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,040
but also work through how you're going

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:34,360
to do the fixes and you sort of end up

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,430
with a matrix of actions from that so

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,320
what I found is that if the technology

00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:41,140
see actually does anybody ever remember

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,610
that we've run package why and nobody in

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,080
the organization thinks they use it

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,950
anywhere the easiest thing is to strip

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,810
it out if they are linking for example

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,280
between copyleft pieces of code they

00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,080
might decide that they can move it into

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,840
a dynamic structure so that there's not

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,280
the risks of a viral effect but it's

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,010
very much a back and forth conversation

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,040
and I think that the solutions that are

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:05,830
legal tend to be your last resort so you

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,080
start with the technological fixes the

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,420
technological solutions look at the

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,280
legal basic licensing issues and then

00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,140
look at what I would call the legal

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,700
hocus-pocus which is where you really

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,230
have to understand what the licenses

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,830
mean to know whether you're compliant or

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,900
not so if I give you an example and this

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,400
part of the reason I put the RSI slide

00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,130
in there and the definition the

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,730
reference to the definition is that I've

00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,860
seen licences come up that are know si

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,660
approved will come up saying they're

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,220
open-source but they don't actually meet

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,260
that definition and aren't approved

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,120
licenses there was one that I came

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,610
across called Greensleeves that was an

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,980
example of that where it says yes you're

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,800
free to use this software on effectively

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,600
open-source terms but if you start to

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,000
use the software in any way that has a

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,710
commercial implication you have to come

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,840
back and get a proprietary license from

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,750
eyes and a paid-for license and it's me

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,460
that's not open source and I think to

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,780
most people it's not open source but

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,190
those are the kind of things that you

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,280
have to know when you're working through

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,770
the license terms so as you work through

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,270
this you may decide that you want to

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:16,150
have a deeper dive and you may actually

00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:19,360
want to go and I think it's referred to

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,980
by colleagues by hand review the code

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,330
packages that are in there if you think

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,920
there's anything that's not coming

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,680
through in the check because when they

00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,360
run these audit tools they're only ever

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,940
going to be as good as the database that

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,770
they're run against so that's something

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,450
you may want to do and some of these

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,710
slides have got a bit weird so here we

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,960
should have a lovely picture of a bill

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,550
of materials which hasn't come up and I

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,770
think you mentioned this morning the

00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,990
software Bill of Materials your ultimate

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,600
goal and any audit has to be to get a

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,070
bill of materials which is clean so a

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,230
bill of materials where you can see what

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,730
edges are in your repository or in your

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,690
distribution or in the product that

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,330
you've created

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,980
what licenses they're on that the

00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,929
licenses interact and are used

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,090
appropriately and that you comply in

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,950
that you comply with the terms so if you

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,450
have to put attributions and the headers

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,090
that you've got those notices in the

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,580
code if you've got to make an offer for

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,159
the Souris that's done so if we sort of

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,460
move to step four of what I wanted to

00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:18,139
say to you is really what do you do once

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,269
you've done that practical physical

00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:23,000
audit and it sort of goes back full

00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:25,460
circle to your kickoff meeting so for me

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,139
that's when you draft the policy you've

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,330
probably been thinking about a lot of

00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:31,340
things from the kickoff meeting you've

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,139
probably had discussion around whether

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
you want copyleft licensing or not

00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:37,610
whether you're going to be mixing

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,110
proprietary and open source whether

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,149
you're going to contribute to projects

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,009
and if you are what sort of license

00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:44,750
agreement or CLA is going to be

00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,340
appropriate for your organization will

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,590
that be signed by the company will it be

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,659
signed by the individual sometimes

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,730
organizations go down a route of having

00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:56,870
blacklist clauses whitelist clauses

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:59,419
Grail s clauses so the response to code

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:01,340
coming in will be different and those

00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:04,159
procedures and policies sort of come out

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,779
of the process of order but you may well

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,460
find that you've kept notes that you've

00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:09,740
gone through the audit where you've seen

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,600
issues arise and you don't want that to

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,360
happen again or you want to work in a

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,100
particular way so it may be that you

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,570
haven't had proper time stamping on the

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,250
code that's come in to your repositories

00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,600
and you decide having done the audit

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,490
that you don't want that problem again

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,929
going forwards so you're going to put

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,429
some sort of tool in place that makes

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:30,080
sure that won't happen this is as long

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,889
as a piece of string it's like saying do

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,600
we have to do this bit first or second

00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:38,690
there are certain key things that need

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,570
to be in there and again anybody who saw

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,149
Andrew Katz talk this morning on the

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,980
open chain project will find a free

00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:47,629
guide to the things that you would put

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,950
into a policy and the kinds of

00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:52,100
procedures that you would be looking for

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,259
from open chain and that will sort of

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,419
get you back to having the good hygiene

00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:58,220
so that going forwards you don't need to

00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:00,409
do an order on the basis that something

00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,960
has gone wrong you're getting investment

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:03,900
asset

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,550
but if you are doing it on the basis

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,440
that you're going to have to settle with

00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,000
somebody around some litigious or give

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,160
some sort of warranty because you're

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,050
taking investment you really need to

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,550
think about what you'll give and it has

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,490
to be limited to the nature of the

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,900
software so my view is that nobody in

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,570
their right mind is going to give a

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,410
broad IP indemnity or IP warranty

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,520
against anything open-source because

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,710
there are different ways of looking at

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,630
open source but ultimately the chances

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,610
are that something has been contributed

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,470
by a community team at some point in the

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,690
process and it should be and that

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,400
shouldn't be a problem and I'm sure that

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,890
you'll have a CLA which they've signed

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,870
off on but it would be wrong for them to

00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,340
be asked to take on huge liabilities and

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,820
individual not being paid for the work

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,750
they're doing so because the

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,220
contributions won't just be corporate

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,640
ones will be individual and small

00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,320
projects that natural cascade or flow of

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,260
liability shouldn't be what you would

00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,730
expect in a proprietary agreement and in

00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,130
my experience at least as a sort of

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,870
industry is held on that and even the

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,390
big corporates will generally not give

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,280
huge liability yes if they're selling

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,780
particular kinds of products there might

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,580
be some sort of legal assurance or

00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,020
indemnity attached to that but that's

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,430
something they're actually selling you

00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,850
that's not just the warranty they're

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,410
giving so it should be qualified it has

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,650
to be best of knowledge because you can

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,420
never ever do a full scan knowing that

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,160
absolutely every line of code is going

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,810
to have been in that library that you're

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,970
scanning against but that's likely to

00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:35,070
need to somehow qualify against or

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,690
relate to a state of the art and that's

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,370
where my experiences they'll ask you to

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,440
have a proprietary tool not a force

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,680
ology that you're running your code base

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,210
against and you need to think long and

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,090
hard about whether you want to give any

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,500
indemnities so there's a difference

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,760
between a warranty and an indemnity a

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,290
warranties a promise whereas an

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,330
indemnity is actually a commitment to

00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,590
pay somebody pound for pound the loss

00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,480
that they incur it depending on the

00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,530
wording that you've got in there and if

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,480
you're going to do that you're actually

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,610
going to put money against it you have

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,410
to think about what you've had come in

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,870
and how you versus you have taken that

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,880
software and that in itself would affect

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,430
your policies and the processes that you

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,900
put in place so just while we're talking

00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,340
about policies I have a couple of other

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,539
thoughts and then I'm

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,210
really hoping that you guys will get

00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,919
into a discussion there are things that

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,679
you will put in your policies that

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,850
aren't in any way related to what you're

00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,070
going to get out of your orders

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,809
and it's unfortunate David is still

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,210
isn't in the room because we were

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,380
talking about software pack patterns and

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,860
he was talking this morning about

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:38,820
implied licenses above and beyond what

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:41,429
you might have or devolved from the open

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,169
source licenses you've got and the open

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:45,960
source licenses will give you a right to

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:49,500
use the copywriting code some of them

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,720
will make claims about patents and you

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,429
need to decide as an organization as

00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,960
part of your open source policy whether

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:57,870
you're going to patent anything around

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,539
open source whether you're going to have

00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,220
any licenses around that and one of the

00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,630
ways of doing that is to look at the

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,179
sort of defensive pattern or ghen

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:09,029
ization Zoe n is one I work for it to be

00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:11,669
absolutely clear but it's a zero cost

00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:12,990
offensive patent pool now Jamie who's

00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,480
going to speak after me specifically

00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,149
about the defense of patent strategies

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,500
and how they relate to open-source is

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:21,120
going to explain the Orion isn't a

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,429
patent pill but I've grown up calling it

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,929
one so it's have to bear with me on that

00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:30,500
and also I think if you're doing an

00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:34,020
audit from a corporate point of view

00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,179
coming into the world where

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,590
collaboration and open source is going

00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,640
to be the norm for your business so

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,029
you're in a sector that perhaps

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,649
traditionally hasn't used or contributed

00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:45,299
greatly to open-source and is now

00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:47,909
dealing with open source projects like

00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:49,559
financial services I think you have to

00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,789
think long and hard about how you're

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,309
going to collaborate and what your

00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:55,100
commitments are going to be I was

00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:58,559
involved in the set up of OpenStack

00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,029
seven years ago now as part of the legal

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,559
committee that put the infrastructure

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:03,750
around that in the governance policies

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,640
in place and you really have to think

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,840
about things like your IP and what

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,279
commitments you have and who's

00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,190
authorized to do what within the

00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:12,990
organization so I really would like to

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,450
stop talking because I've talked quite a

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,309
lot quite quickly but I'm happy to

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:22,890
discuss anything around the audits that

00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:26,019
you might want to or to take feedback or

00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:29,480
questions or comments

00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:31,690
you look at me blankly is a topic for

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,690
this

00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,950
[Laughter]

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,410
[Music]

00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:41,630
yeah my experience has been do a little

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,830
policy yeah I totally agree yeah totally

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,690
agree and that's when you make the

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:48,309
decisions at the end but be aware of it

00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,309
and carry it through with you yeah

00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,750
because you're probably a fine stuff you

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,030
don't know how to fix your we don't have

00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:07,960
time to fix this it's in the M&A case

00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:09,880
it's great yeah yeah when you're doing

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,610
internal work you sometimes have to

00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:17,530
trade off yeah being pragmatic versus

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:18,970
finding all the problems and I think

00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,500
that's absolutely essential because it

00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,630
comes back to working out what the goals

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,700
of doing this are why are you doing it

00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,080
who's involved have you really got the

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,700
right decision makers because if you

00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,500
don't have a CTO or somebody at that

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,970
level making the decisions you're not

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,580
going to get those decisions for weeks

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:37,930
or months on end so it really is a

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:39,520
business need a business case I haven't

00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,070
seen one where we haven't thought that

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,290
we fixed everything but we've made

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:47,080
pragmatic decisions around the final

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,720
fixes so your list just gets shorter and

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,700
shorter and it really should be a very

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,490
very interactive process of sitting down

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,430
I haven't seen so many commercial people

00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,710
in it yes from the people from the audit

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,540
tool providers but not from within

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,950
businesses from my experience it really

00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,650
tends to be the technologists and the

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,440
lawyers working together and I think

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,120
part of the thing for me is you've

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,950
called it a call and I'm sure that's how

00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,930
it often ends up being but I actually

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,610
think a face-to-face meeting is quite

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,370
important at the start of these projects

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,330
and trying to sit down and really scope

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:25,440
things out that way if you can any other

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,440
thoughts feedback

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,400
yeah yeah

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,960
you can either yeah there's multiple

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,420
ways of doing I know it's huge it's

00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,590
absolutely huge and this is what Andrea

00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,240
and I were talking about so I don't know

00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,180
if you notice in his presentation this

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,290
morning if you were in it he had under a

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,580
hundred packages and he sort of really

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,870
was pushing me to talk about a deep dive

00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,390
that's not something that I've really

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,160
seen done I've always seen an audit done

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,800
using a tool because the ones that I've

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,480
worked on have been enormous and you're

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,890
sitting with reams and reams of paper at

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,440
the end of it trying to work out what

00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:17,730
bit goes there and using what I think

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,130
possibly if you depends how it ties up

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:23,670
but you may want to split it into areas

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,440
and you may want to make the CTO of the

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,390
person responsible for final decisions

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,730
but have multiple mini projects working

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,860
as many audits feeding back into that

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,420
overall and agreeing between a group of

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,830
people representing those projects where

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:39,150
the company policies and the lines are

00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:40,680
going to be on them yeah well I think

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,980
what you do is you start with some

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,210
basics so you would hope that by the

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,170
time you get to the stage of doing an

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,490
audit there's been enough of a

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,470
conversation that you're going to have

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,030
some materials within the organization

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,450
so you're going to acknowledge that

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,550
you've got some source as a start and

00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:00,180
from there there tends to have been some

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,710
statement put into some manual in a big

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,330
company so I would start by getting that

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,650
out and have everybody laugh at it or

00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,860
agree that it's actually what it should

00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,540
be and then go back to that as you get

00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,630
to the end of the audit but Reavers are

00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,460
individual issues as you go because they

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,710
sit out exactly what Jeff was saying as

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,570
you go through it the issues that you

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,970
have will not be what you expect that's

00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,440
part of the reason for doing it if you

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,320
knew what the issues were you wouldn't

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,800
be looking blind at it but it it really

00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,369
will vary how long it will take to do

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,829
how quickly have you ever seen things

00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:42,299
how deep you're going so yeah looking at

00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:44,099
a single company you see a lot of times

00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:48,569
where you try to fit it into a two-week

00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:56,269
turnaround time yeah yeah yeah but

00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:58,670
that's the goal of the M&A process yeah

00:37:56,269 --> 00:38:01,499
but you're also putting have a trade-off

00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:04,079
I've never seen it take years I've seen

00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:06,210
it take months but not use and where you

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,220
get so if that tends to be that you

00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,019
accept you've got a certain point and

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,430
create the policy in the processes for

00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:14,450
the go forward and hope you're sleeping

00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,450
certain things up as you go

00:38:19,819 --> 00:39:00,299
yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's good

00:38:53,309 --> 00:39:01,950
good advice actually yeah and I think it

00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,809
all comes back to why are you doing it

00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,039
this example is where you're looking at

00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,749
something because it is that good

00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,239
hygiene good housekeeping we all ought

00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:12,089
to do in our organizations but to get

00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,849
the money to do the audit in the first

00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:16,619
place that tends to be a prompter and if

00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:17,819
that prompter is specific to a product

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,829
that's the first product you're going to

00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:21,239
do I've not really seen people have to

00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:22,920
sit down and make a decision the

00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,630
decision to sort have been made for them

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,759
when they start doing this because it

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,319
needs to be done I don't think I've ever

00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:30,390
encountered an organization that's just

00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:34,240
done the the audit because they thought

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:37,240
it was a good idea yeah

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,619
yeah yeah I don't generally see

00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,530
organizations ready to spend a lot of

00:39:38,619 --> 00:40:01,210
money quickly but unless was that reason

00:39:41,530 --> 00:40:03,250
anything else yes this is a constant

00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,810
sort of debate because the license

00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,280
should be in the code it shouldn't just

00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,450
be in the contract so I don't

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,849
necessarily think you should be

00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:12,160
reviewing the license if you've got any

00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:14,470
form of open source called software in

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,300
there irrespective of the contracts and

00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,490
the ability riyals or schedules attached

00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,530
to that contract with EULA's in it this

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,510
should actually be some reference and

00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,820
the code in the attribution clause and

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,020
the notice or the actual license that's

00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,040
attached to the code itself you

00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,900
shouldn't have to go back to your

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,369
commercial agreements if you are there's

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:44,230
something wrong and your process needs

00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:46,450
looked at what you're getting back to

00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:49,270
what a EULA is and you could have a

00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,339
whole other session on apps and app

00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:53,530
stores and licensing and additional

00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,869
conditions and GPL and whether or not

00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,450
people want to sue Apple and it's a

00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:00,520
whole separate conversation personally

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,320
there should be nothing that you have to

00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,210
go to a contract to look for it should

00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,040
all be if it's open source it should all

00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,140
be in there it doesn't mean it will be

00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,099
but it should be and that's kind of what

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,560
you're trying to drive out in the

00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:13,180
process so it's not beyond the realms of

00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,680
possibility that you will have to go and

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,109
look at a commercial agreement to get

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,720
the EULA's or to speak to the provider

00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:22,410
to find out where they are but they

00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,700
should have been in the codebase anyway

00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,200
the notices in the codebase should

00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,609
reference it so I'm being told to wrap

00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,290
up but if anybody wants to talk more

00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:34,530
about it I'm happy to thank you

00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:38,039
[Applause]
