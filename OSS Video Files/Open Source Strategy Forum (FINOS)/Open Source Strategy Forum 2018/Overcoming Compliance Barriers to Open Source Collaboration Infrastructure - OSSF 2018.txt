[Music]

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,700
so today's on panel is on overcoming

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,340
compliance barriers to open source

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,980
collaboration infrastructure so what

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,330
does that mean all right how many of you

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,189
work at a bank today okay and how many

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,380
of you are allowed to use your gmail

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,800
address to join a Google Group or commit

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,270
some code to github all right so you

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,780
know what compliance barriers are to

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,800
infrastructure whoops whoops did we lose

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,239
signal here there we go all right so um

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
we're just gonna set the stage a little

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,700
bit we're gonna try and do a panel Jamie

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,680
from github and maow from federalist are

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,870
here with me today and I'm gonna try not

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
to talk too much we're gonna talk a

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,420
little bit about what the barriers are

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,550
but I think a lot of you are very

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,079
familiar with them and then we're going

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,210
to talk about some of the things that

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,430
are going on in fin offs that are

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,710
helping to reduce those barriers and and

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,110
give a plug for some up-and-coming

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,150
projects that are working here as well

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,070
and and go through all this so we're

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,180
going to try and leave a lot of time for

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,540
Q&A so just there so we all know that

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,790
the financial services is very highly

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,070
regulated you you're probably the most

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,390
highly regulated industry maybe outside

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,990
of healthcare that I get to work in and

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,340
that unregulated banking is is not a

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,240
good thing so we're not going to get rid

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,439
of that regulation anytime soon and

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,780
we've all seen the huge issues when data

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,000
is not secured and data is lost and data

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,280
is hacked or police we do they so a lot

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,530
of our time and energy and the reasons

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,890
for those compliance barriers are just

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,470
to make sure that we don't have any data

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,590
loss or lose any intellectual property

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,060
or that's really one of the highest

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,860
priorities and all of the banking and

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,659
FinTech companies that we work with and

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,190
basically because of that and one of the

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,910
reasons that you don't get access to

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,380
Gmail or get to use your your iPhone or

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,360
whatever it is in in how

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,100
is because there's all this surveillance

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,700
that's going on and the surveillance in

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,710
this sense is it's not it's not a secret

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,450
that you're being surveilled if you work

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,950
at a bank or anything everything you do

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,620
is logged and audited and tracked and

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,380
that brings another whole set of issues

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,120
for you to have to deal with when you

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,730
come to an open source community and

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,620
want to collaborate because we were just

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,780
having a great conversation about IRC

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,030
and slack and all of the other tools

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,790
that all of us who work in open source

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,140
at Red Hat and other places have the

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,900
opportunity to use without any

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,840
regulation and we look like the kids in

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,390
the candy store to you guys that candy

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,580
store can be very bad too because at Red

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,910
Hat for example we don't say which slack

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,980
channel or which instant messaging tool

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,400
you'd have to use so Henson therefore

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,410
just for red heading alone I have

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,540
whatsapp I have rocket chat I have IRC I

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,670
have slack and probably five other

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,160
things plus five other things to do

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,920
webinars in because everybody has a

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,260
favorite toy all right so there's a

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,590
degree of where this gets to be a bad

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,430
thing but one of the things that we're

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,680
trying to do here with fin OS is we do a

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,930
lot of surveys a lot of talking within

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,090
and focus groups with people from the

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,390
banking and finance industry to find out

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,730
and uncover the different tools that you

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,220
can use and the ones that you can't use

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,150
we're looking for the one you know how

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,820
we can help you with that

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,920
by creating chat BOTS or things that are

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,020
creating those audit logs and the things

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,150
that you need so that's really a big

00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:59,730
piece of what we're trying to bring to

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,500
you from the fin or spec t'v so the

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,450
other thing is besides chatting with

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,360
each other is development environments

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,340
so a lot of you are working in

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,190
environments where you know you cannot

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,900
just download an image from docker hub

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,810
and use it how many of you have

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,940
downloaded an image from docker hub with

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,859
a application on it and been allowed to

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,760
deploy it on a server behind your

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:27,860
firewall yeah so you have no firewall

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,860
okay well he's got a different problem

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,400
and so you know yeah he's got a

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,950
different problem he's got a different

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,180
problem but and and it's not like when

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,770
you go to China there are things that

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,140
are blocked when you go there talking

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,630
you know try and use Facebook or one of

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,220
the other tools but at any go inside of

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,840
any bank there's a lot of other things

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,280
that are blocked as well whole domain

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,230
names of things that you'd want to be

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,940
able to use and the caveat that everyone

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,980
has this is if you violate those things

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,380
if you try like I would whose is the

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,910
waltz guy in the room like yes the waltz

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,490
guys in there trying to work on an

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,880
open-source project at an unnamed bank

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,560
and having to you know go around and do

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,540
that all that work used probably with a

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,240
gmail account or whatever outside of the

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,740
the working hours is the one way you end

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,080
up contributing to an open-source

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,230
project until it's so hot and cool that

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,320
the cave and allow you to to work on it

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,950
internally but it takes a lot of work to

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,950
get that stuff so very rarely do we see

00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:33,430
a banking and finance company that has

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,800
access to a full open-source

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,810
you know development platform and so

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,700
what we've been doing here with fin OS

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,280
is there's an open developer platform

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,170
everybody have heard of ODP if you

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,940
haven't then gab hasn't been talking

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,210
loud enough but we will talk about a

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,250
little bit more because really what

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,890
we're trying to our goal is to figure

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,130
out how to lower those barriers and in

00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:00,460
some things like for me on a daily basis

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm logging into github I'm logging into

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,130
OpenShift which is our developer

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,810
platforms built on kubernetes or

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,430
Atlassian to come and comment on

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,250
something that Mau has written and told

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,710
me that I have to update on on the

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,600
fitter website or I'm on a slack channel

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,400
these are like that ubiquitous things

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,570
that you'll see me on and you can find

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,790
me in on any given day because I can but

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,530
there are ways and if you look at the

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,680
one for open shift this social

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,110
authentication sometimes that's the key

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,820
that helps you get access to these

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,860
things one of those things maybe it's

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,970
the Google one maybe it's linked there's

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,419
something that you can do so we're

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:43,120
looking at trying to figure out what

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,860
we can do to lower those barriers to

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,860
participation so that you don't get

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,650
fired for working on your sidecar you

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,160
know your what is the side hustle at

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,930
work and try and figure out how to make

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,300
sure that you are able to this because I

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,639
think this whole two-day event here

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,410
today and tomorrow is all about the

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,990
wonders and the wonderfulness about

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,690
driving innovation using open source

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,150
stuff but if you can't even access the

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,980
git repo where the code is then you've

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,860
got a problem I mean you don't get the

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,490
benefit of sharing ideas or putting in a

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,830
pull request and we don't as open-source

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,950
developers get the the feedback that we

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,650
need on our project so we're and and I

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,270
think that's really the mandate for fin

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,490
OS is to figure out how to lower those

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,030
barriers specifically for FS eyes and

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,850
and fin deck the other things that we're

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,310
really trying to proliferate our shared

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,350
CIC D pipelines so that when you do

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,960
build something that we can collaborate

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,880
on making sure that it's continuously

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,130
and integrated and the development

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,350
processors are using state-of-the-art

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,810
technologies and sharing the development

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,610
platform which is what doe DP is so

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,810
there's a lot of work still to be done

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:01,330
and so my colleagues and I have been

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:08,500
part of the fin OS when did finna Wes

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:16,120
start ok so not very long but we've been

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:18,400
all collaborating yeah so this next bit

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,750
I think it's Jamie's Jamie's turn to

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,669
talk so I'm gonna turn it over to Jamie

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,940
Jones from github and he's going to talk

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,500
about one of the working group says

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,610
beautiful Thank You Diane as Diana

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,570
mentioned I'm Jamie Jones from github

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,880
and I run chair of the fin serve

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,919
developer Experience Program says you've

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,870
heard today there's some 1012 programs

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,760
within the foundation today everything

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,880
from voice technology to desktop

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,250
technology to financial object creation

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,870
and standardization though as Diane

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,160
mentioned there's a lot of tools that go

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,100
in the background to make these sort of

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,390
programs in these processes work

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,720
collaboration spaces like Atlassian

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,089
products JIRA canned fluid

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,980
ability to share code like github and

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,920
things like open chef to actually run

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,779
these products and projects on FDX sort

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,779
of focuses on those processes themselves

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:08,149
making sure that you banks organizations

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,439
can get access to these tools as well as

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,230
your requirements for these tools

00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:14,870
whether it be access ports surveillance

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,060
compliant audit or all understood not

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,100
only amongst each other as well as to

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,620
the tool vendors themselves so while I'm

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,180
from github we work within our within

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,660
the program itself in the working groups

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,850
with all sorts of vendors so from get

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,680
lab who's also a member here of the

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,149
foundation to either people who are not

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,040
members of the foundation because at the

00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,750
end of the day you as banks use a lot of

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,279
tools that aren't necessarily members of

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,009
the foundation so it's our goal to sort

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,879
of streamline all of that process so I

00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:43,189
want to give you a little bit of an

00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,240
overview of the FDX program itself and

00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,470
then we'll start digging into the

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,110
working groups to sort of give you an

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,600
idea for how we're trying to tackle the

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,250
compliance and regulatory problems that

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,959
we tend to run into that Dianne just so

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,170
eloquently explained and then we'll sort

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,180
of open it up for a QA but sort of as

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,819
the eye chart says right the FDA X

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,300
program is to try to define and describe

00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:07,129
high productivity in to end development

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,050
environments for not only the finished

00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,730
foundation members but for regulated

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,980
industries for banks for fence or for

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,660
fin tech in general right we do that by

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,120
three specific working groups developer

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,000
experience cloud native as well as the

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,170
ODP and again we'll get more in touch

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,389
onto all of those here shortly

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,910
for the FDX landscape itself so we see

00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,370
contributions from the outside both from

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,459
what are we showing here developers

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,220
software vendors as well as application

00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:39,019
providers so truly the programs within

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,970
the foundation itself they're bringing

00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,370
their requirements their questions their

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,870
needs and their concerns into either the

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,339
developer experience working group or

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,290
the cloud native working group depending

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,300
on the topic and then we're sort of

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,519
triaging them working with outside

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,870
vendors or internal vendors as well as

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,149
bringing those requirements into the

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,540
open developer platform as a way to sort

00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,889
of realize them in a in a vehicle for

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,689
everyone within the foundation to use

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,949
also at the same time we see the

00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:07,130
thinnest foundation staff themselves

00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:09,080
bringing requirements and you know as as

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,260
Diane mentioned a few minutes ago gab

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,970
the director has one-on-ones each month

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,110
with all of our members and works very

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,240
closely with a lot of their technical

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,310
projects so he's getting information as

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,170
well of we need to help access this toy

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,360
it would be really great if finish could

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,800
provide access to this API or this sort

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,930
of data set or this sort of

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,460
collaboration capability so they get

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,760
these in this information that they can

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,230
bring into the OTP as well and finally

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,700
we've mentioned OTP a lot and again now

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,500
we'll go into it in detail a little bit

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,330
further but it really is what we

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,910
consider to be a prescriptive way to

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,800
develop open source not just for the

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,870
programs within the foundation but

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,570
really for developers who have to work

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,750
in regulated environments that can meet

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:53,000
your needs so it uses common modern

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,220
best-of-breed tooling as well as the

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,260
security workflow and auditing

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,060
compliance requirements that we think

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,980
hit the majority of the use cases this

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,960
is not to say that we can't pick a bank

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,240
off of a shelf and they can't they won't

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,860
give us ten difference compliance and

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,810
legal requirements that it does not meet

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,340
but overall as we're talking about

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,680
what's the ninety percent use case the

00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,630
95 percent use case throughout the year

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,860
so the OTP actually pre-existed the

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,570
thinnest foundation was one of the

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,790
legacy pullovers from the symphony

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:23,120
software foundation we found it to be a

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,920
really good abstraction in a tool to

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,040
help get organizations up and running on

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,930
open-source quickly so just as a

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,680
reminder as we have a two days going on

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,210
early on today speaking of FDX

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,800
panel we're doing right now I gave us

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,720
talked earlier about security and open

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,210
source and using these tools for that

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,910
there is also a tool conversation at

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,190
1:30 about the CLA BOTS and some of the

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,860
automation and compliance features built

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,440
into ODP also tomorrow there are two

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,360
different talks relating to FDX one of

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,010
them at 9:40 is talking about how

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,860
goldman sachs does their open source

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,570
process and sort of how they get code

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,430
out into the open as well as another

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,920
another discussion panel I think

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,140
actually at 10:00 a.m. more specifically

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,760
than going from Goldman Sachs example to

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,760
how it goes into the ODP and gets used

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,770
by the greater community so from a

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,570
high-level view of the FDX program

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,670
itself a little bit deeper dive into the

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,080
DX working group again I already sort of

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,220
gave this overview but it's trying to

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,750
get in more of the technical

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,590
requirements in detail

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,390
that go into organizations using modern

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,640
software and modern software practices

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,820
so it's again involved with finished

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,170
members program participants because

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,340
since we're an open-source foundation

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,260
you don't have to be a member to

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,910
actually participate in our programs or

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,170
working groups as well as anyone

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,480
throughout the financial services

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,590
industry a good example of the sort of

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,540
things we've been working on lately

00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,060
we've been working with LUN one large

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,040
bank who is on their firewall

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,390
requirements for getting to external

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,160
tools such as JIRA and github what ports

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,260
need to be open and whether we can

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,000
restrict out certain features to them

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,010
because that's what their compliance and

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,400
legal teams need we've worked with

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:07,030
another group who's looking for how

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,890
github issues can meet their

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:15,650
collaboration and compliance

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,480
requirements they see get-up issues as a

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,490
public representation of their firm

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,490
which means it needs to be approved

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,840
before being released externally anyone

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,550
who's ever worked or contributed to an

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,110
open-source project you can imagine

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,580
getting every comment you would make and

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,190
that project to be approved by your

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,200
external brand and marketing team isn't

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,250
something that really scales so working

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,960
with them to better understand what

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,000
their legal requirements are what the

00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,860
tools the ODP has in place can help to

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,300
facilitate that and also giving them

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,980
some discussions and questions they can

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,770
ask their own legal and compliance team

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,210
- maybe not push back but to dig deeper

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,070
into what the actual requirement that

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,570
needs to be solved and maybe we can

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,490
solve it in another fashion maybe

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,920
instead of blocking it we can audit it

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,520
or we can give the ability to retract it

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,900
in a certain time period in case it

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,300
betrayed what the firm was was trying to

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,040
show and finally we've been working with

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,410
programs within the foundation itself a

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,760
good example is FDC 3 was looking for

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,200
ways to share some of the standards

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,730
api's and tools that they've been

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,250
developing over the past few months so

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,780
they brought their requirement how can

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,060
we share this with the greater community

00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,190
to DX and DX has worked with them and

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,680
talked through the options of wiki is in

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,890
static website hosting and everything

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,060
from swagger Docs to big text files and

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,710
sort of working them through those

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,690
requirements not only what meets their

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,190
needs but what will be accessible to

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,490
their members and to other banks as well

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,589
so we sort of have we work

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,820
any hats within the DAX program really

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:40,220
trying to answer any technical questions

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,620
or access questions any of our members

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,880
would have and that in a nutshell is DX

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:49,250
Diane we're just going to keep walking

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,170
through this and so the newest I think

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,910
the newest working group is probably

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:57,140
this one the cloud native working group

00:15:52,910 --> 00:16:00,080
how many of you have done any work with

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,440
the CNC f the cloud native compute

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,510
foundation you know some of us have so

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,029
this we just out of those focus groups

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,100
and the things that people have been

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,750
asking for more information on and more

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,240
reference architectures and more best

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,980
practices and white papers on has been

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:23,180
this whole new paradigm paradigm of

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:25,580
cloud computing so this is a very it

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,380
comes from the CN CF that the definition

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,830
of this is cloud computing uses open

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,310
source and open source software stack to

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,390
segment applications into micro-services

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,779
packaging each of them into its own

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,640
container and dynamically orchestrating

00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,250
those containers to optimize resource

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,839
utilization and scale should say and

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,640
scale afterwards so when we talk about

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,430
docker containers or container images

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,709
and things along that nation like thing

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,610
we still have a lot of Education to do

00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:00,649
there's been a long history getting from

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:04,160
from the non virtualized hardware to

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,750
virtualization and came around 2001 then

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,839
there was infrastructure as a service

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,400
and Amazon did a wonderful job with that

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,630
and then there was something which was

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,300
near and dear to my heart

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,339
platform as a service and Heroku proud I

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,670
think came out with the first offering

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,579
around that and then sort of in response

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,040
to Amazon's web service of the is the

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,650
open source is OpenStack which is having

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,370
its conference this week right now in

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,530
parallel with us in Berlin came along in

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,380
2011 and then this thing called

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,900
containers got really popular when

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,210
docker came out with its ubiquitous

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,040
standard for containerization containers

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,380
had been around for a long time how No

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,840
you know about LXE containers and things

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,350
along that nature but docker did us a

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,660
wonderful

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,809
favor they made it very popular and very

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,370
pervasive throughout the developer

00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,410
communities and which has been a

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,650
wonderful thing and then the next thing

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,260
that came along was kubernetes how many

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,580
of you have heard of kubernetes c.c my

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,860
work is done I can go home now

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,929
that's all good it's all good and

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,030
kubernetes is what the project that I

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:14,840
work on OpenShift and okd

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,179
is built on and kubernetes also is not

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,270
the only piece of that stack there at

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,620
the CN CF has about I don't know the

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,260
last time I counted there was 15

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,970
projects from Prometheus to open tracing

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,020
to a whole bunch of other ones they're

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,640
all tooling for working in this new

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,980
micro-services containerized highly

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,770
orchestrated environment and we know

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,990
that all of you are somewhere in this

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:43,250
history somewhere on this this this

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,510
vector going that way hopefully and

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,820
there's a lot of lifting and shifting

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:52,700
and a lot of legacy apps there that need

00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:54,860
help and need some education on so we've

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,270
learned a lot and some of us get to be

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,850
on the bleeding edge of things because

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,700
that's just the nature of being at Red

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,580
Hat and other tech companies but we have

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,470
really seen the world move from servers

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,690
to virtual machines and containers

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,340
though I met having great conversations

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,919
recently about running open shift on

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,630
bare metal so it's like you know wait a

00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,120
minute I thought I was over here but now

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,390
I'm back here so there's a lot of leeway

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,870
here we've gone from the isolation units

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:26,750
being very heavy the VMS that are still

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,030
running out they're running Windows

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,010
workloads or your legacy windows captive

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,030
in a some VM because you need that app

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,190
to run

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,330
we know that's there but we're getting

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:40,429
to the lighter weight lower footprint

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:45,049
operating systems like core OS and

00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:47,000
others and we've gone to to more from we

00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:50,570
call pets to cattle so instead of having

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,090
our favorite application that we loved

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,650
and nurtured and there to having lots of

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,960
those containers running so if one of

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,549
them dies something else springs up to

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,409
take its place so we've really changed

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,770
the art with the way we architect our

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:05,670
application and the way that we

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,980
deploy them and we've gone - and I know

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,750
this sounds like a red hat hype or

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,590
somebody but we've gone to a much more

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:16,800
hybrid model of cloud hosting where you

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:19,130
can run your application if it's

00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,420
containerized and you've properly

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,300
developed it on any of the cloud

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,730
providers and so that is really the end

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,430
goal here is not to lock you into any

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,350
one cloud you can do that well enough by

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,290
using their special services and things

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,210
like that that you're gonna do that fine

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,130
but you have the option here of being

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,260
able to move your workloads either on

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,270
Prem or to any cloud provider and that's

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,480
really the goal of the cloud native

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,460
architectures one of the other goals of

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,400
the cloud native group that we're

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,710
working on is building out the fin OS

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,090
service catalog or mark some of you

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,820
might have think of it as a marketplace

00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:00,330
with and what we'd like to do is take

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,920
and expose all of the projects and the

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,230
tooling that are being developed on

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,780
infini ass from the voice recognition

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,600
stuff to the FDX - all of these

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,730
wonderful things and have a catalog that

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,490
you can just deploy and test and build

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,270
applications on OpenShift which is

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,330
what's under the hood

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,760
ODP and deploy them anywhere and that's

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,190
really one of our goals so if you're

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,830
interested in making taking your project

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,550
and transitioning it to that that's this

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,650
is the working group for you

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:35,540
so our Charter which I wrote like a week

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:38,100
ago so I'm sure it's gonna be new

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,040
hot-off-the-press here is really is

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,830
about creating that the reference

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,810
architectures the white papers talking

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,060
to you guys in the focus groups about

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,670
what your use cases are and then

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,370
curating and promoting things into a

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,980
finish at log so helping you if you're

00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,410
working on any of the other 12 or 13 or

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,100
15 projects there are now whatever the

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,900
next week it'll be 15 getting those into

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,300
containers and available for people to

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,900
use via you know the Service Catalog

00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,640
inside of ODP and so what I'm going to

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,160
pitch for because this is two weeks old

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,600
is if you're interested in this or if

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,549
you have expertise in this area

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,890
or you have a service that you'd like to

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,220
see learn how to containerize come work

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,789
with us

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,620
and will happily handhold you through

00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,330
the first build of an image if that's

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,250
where you're at or will happily give you

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,080
the podium to talk about what you've

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,549
done and so we can learn from your best

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,940
practices and the lessons that you've

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:41,309
learned so we're moving very quickly

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:43,890
Brian Inc engine ito he's not here so in

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:47,640
his stead Mau is going to give the the

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:51,690
ODP platform working group Todd thank

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:55,110
you good afternoon everyone so today I

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,270
just real quick want to give you an

00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,580
update on what is the mission of the

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,250
charter of the open developer platform I

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,110
hope it's clear from what Jaime

00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,530
introduced before what the open

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,020
developer platform does is to collect

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:13,350
requirements decomposes them prioritize

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,870
them and just bundles them into Sprint's

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,480
that are later lexa cuted by the Venus

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,240
infra team which is myself plus Nikko

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,789
another guy what it doesn't do is to

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,380
validate these use cases because this is

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,110
what the developer experience and the

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,049
cloud native working group are for so

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:34,169
basically if you're looking to find a

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:36,360
solution to a problem these are the guys

00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:40,049
you should talk to if you know that

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,850
there is an ongoing activity that is in

00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,860
progress in the open developer platform

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:47,070
working group you are welcome to discuss

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:50,780
this with us you are welcome to actually

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:56,610
push for a more for a quicker resolution

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:58,799
okay to vote for that so the team is

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,559
actually composed right now by Brian

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:08,360
engineer the chair Diane Jamie and

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:13,950
myself would sorry Morgan Sally

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:17,400
apologies yes and we use mini list the

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:20,549
FDX ODP at Venus autogas main

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,679
communication channel we meet bi-weekly

00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,900
on Wednesday 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time

00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:29,970
you're welcome to join our WebEx calls

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:31,920
there oh they are open for listening in

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,760
we use the wiki as we mentioned before

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,950
to gather documentation and we use JIRA

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,200
to manage the backlog now all of this

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,780
infrastructure is open so you can go and

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,130
check what we're doing if we are solving

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,090
some of the problems that you are facing

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,760
so to get back to some of the things

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:54,300
that Jaime mentioned before these are

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,670
the activities that we feel like we've

00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,380
already delivered because again this is

00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,240
the open developer platform is something

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,330
that started in 2016

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,240
probably my first activity when I joined

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:09,480
Finas which used to be called simple

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,940
sort of foundation in May 2016 so this

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,790
is something that is going on since a

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,030
while right before developer experience

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,429
and cloud native we also were the venue

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,770
where we collected requirements and did

00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:25,200
validation right so now we're trying to

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:28,559
offload a little bit of the tasks to our

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,010
two other work groups but we identified

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,000
if you want some evolution if you want

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:38,940
of the ODP roadmap we feel like we are

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,830
pretty much on the second stage in the

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,390
compliant stage we started off by

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:49,890
basically publishing best practices

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:52,559
right how do you use branches with

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,420
github which kind of security

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,520
validations you should be doing and so

00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:01,470
on and so forth now we're moving more

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:05,000
into the development of tools for

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:09,510
compliance and validation we are helping

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,429
programs within feena's specifically one

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,800
of the latest is have tc3 where we got a

00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:17,610
lot of activity because the program is

00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:20,220
almost ready to release standards so we

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,809
are supporting the activity of other

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,200
fitness program to make them productive

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:29,340
and in the future what we really want to

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,820
see is that is to see Finnis

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,780
participants banks which are part of our

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,810
cream of this community to be able to

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:43,110
just manage their activity by themselves

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:46,700
without asking for a review without you

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:50,510
having to rely on the Finas team

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:54,330
specifically right last but not least

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:55,950
the integrated let's say step of the

00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:00,260
evolution is where I would like to see

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:02,880
like the open developer platform using

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:06,510
containerized architectures to build

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,840
this pipeline or having a white paper or

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,760
several white papers produced by the

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:28,320
developer experience on how this

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:33,230
end-to-end workflow works so okay well

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:42,890
that works she work around shut down

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:46,049
restart so just a quick slide on who is

00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:48,270
welcome and who can participate to this

00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:51,809
working group if you're a software

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:54,419
vendor and you are building tools the

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:56,400
help that could be a good addition to

00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,650
this to this end-to-end developer

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,110
pipeline what Jamie showed before in the

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,600
open developer platform you are welcome

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,480
to join the conversation and to actually

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,640
share your solution right whether it's

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,620
gonna be shared as a hosted service

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,679
whether we deploy it whether it's a

00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:18,870
white paper it's it's still a lot of

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,850
value for these industry right or anyone

00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:24,030
else who's interested in the activities

00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:26,309
that are in progress within the open

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:29,429
developer platform working group you can

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:32,820
just listen in you can join one of our

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:35,100
web access you can comment the JIRA

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:39,150
issues so you can drop a comment on on

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:41,900
confluence still again if if the issue

00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,980
is still not part of the ODP backlog

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,520
probably you want to talk to the

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:51,179
developer experience or cloud native

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:53,669
working group so this was just a very

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:57,149
high-level overview of the open

00:28:53,669 --> 00:29:00,029
developer platform tomorrow 10:00 a.m.

00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:02,369
room eight or nine probably room nine

00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:05,539
10:00 a.m. we have a working session so

00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:08,149
I'm going to go through technical

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:11,729
details of these ODP pipeline

00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:15,779
specifically imagining that Goldman

00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:18,210
Sachs sends a a pull request to a penis

00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,789
host project what does the open

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,249
developer platform do what is the value

00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:25,259
that adds up to this pull request we're

00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:28,139
gonna we're gonna go through this

00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:30,289
pipeline tomorrow and quite quickly and

00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:32,999
then we're going to open for

00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:34,830
conversation with the audience because I

00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:36,989
understand that banks are in this venue

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:41,219
I mean open source strategy forum for us

00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:44,429
is an extremely important opportunity to

00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:50,389
meet and to validate what we're building

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:50,389
with you coming from banks so with that

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:58,109
for the final remarks or we open the

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,589
other time what time is the the hands-on

00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:11,669
workshop start tomorrow any yeah the a

00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:12,570
wind shift one okay yeah so the other

00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,190
thing that's happening tomorrow

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,799
afternoon if you want some hands-on

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,779
experience we brought a bunch of the

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,570
folks from the open shift team in ODP

00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:24,450
under the hood has a large component of

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,460
the seat the CI and the CD is running on

00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,599
open shift so you can get some hands-on

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,429
experience there too

00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:35,580
so um that final remarks don't have

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:37,889
final marks closing I guess I do

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:49,979
there there you wrote see I didn't write

00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:51,929
all these slides yeah yeah sure hi

00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:54,119
everyone I'm your impromptu panelist my

00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,589
name is Lesley Hawthorne I work at Red

00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,200
Hat on the open source and standards

00:30:55,589 --> 00:31:00,779
team and the open source readiness

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,059
working group is a collective effort

00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,609
with fee notes and the rest of the folks

00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:10,259
who are working on this including mr.

00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:10,620
Jamie Jones to help Pinos members become

00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:12,780
ready

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,390
to implement open-source strategies so

00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:18,240
this is everything from how do we do

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,160
code audits to ensure that we are using

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,070
open source software in compliance with

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,840
its licensing requirements - we would

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,720
like to create an open-source review

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,180
board what is the process for that how

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,980
do we train developers in order to make

00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,040
sure that they will follow the rules

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,080
regarding open source software - do we

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,970
need an open source programs office and

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,730
if so what does that structure look like

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:44,370
for us so we have regular working group

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,600
calls if you are working to implement an

00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,090
open source strategy within your

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,860
organization or would like to share best

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,870
practices from having done that we would

00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,480
love for you to join us and you can get

00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,610
in touch with me or aaron williamson to

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:03,660
get added to the recurring cost thanks

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:06,210
folks yeah sure so is there any question

00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:10,440
from the room or anything that anyone

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,220
from banks want to share is this what is

00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,170
this

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:20,660
solving you some issues or as would you

00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,660
like to see something else in here

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,260
so that's an interesting question this

00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:59,570
is something that we have that I

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,169
actually phrased as ODP surveyed

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:07,370
surveilled code management tool so I

00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:09,590
think that the surveilled issue on

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,740
developing code is something that should

00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:15,860
that is normally fixed within the

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:19,279
firewall the corporate firewall rather

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:27,169
than being an afterthought right because

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:29,870
what if you if you wanna what so so I

00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:32,630
don't have a specific answer to that I

00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,970
think that it's right now we see that

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:37,940
while Jamie was mentioning before in his

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:41,539
previous presentation about proxy

00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:45,220
solution so proxy that can be installed

00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:48,080
behind the firewall and takes care of

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,820
doing the validation and the analysis

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:56,630
before having the code published openly

00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:59,779
right so at the same time within ODP we

00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,909
do have some validations but it's based

00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:05,029
on the code that is already public right

00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:09,770
so I believe that a solution for the

00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:15,669
financial word a solid solution should

00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:20,030
be based on on some sort of proxying

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:23,149
mechanism that will allow banks to be

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:26,300
sure that if there is any concern with

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:28,570
the code that is about to go public it

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,970
will be intercepted before going live

00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:35,060
but again this is this is something

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:39,050
where I know that github is is working

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,889
on and I don't know maybe Jamie can

00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,330
share some thoughts

00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,330
Leslie you had some thoughts as well

00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,230
sorry so I just wanted to say it that

00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,339
there's there's two halves to that

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,200
question there's the technical

00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:54,030
implementation solution and then there's

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,820
the talking to folks within your

00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,910
organization about changing processes

00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,980
and policies to be less onerous so that

00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,510
your developers are more able to access

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,490
all the resources Diane called out as

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,260
part of her day job and the open source

00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,580
readiness working group is is absolutely

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,960
here to help you make that business case

00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,170
if that's going to be helpful to you in

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,540
your job the other thing I'll add on to

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,400
that and sort of your comment was good

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,930
and since it asked the question how can

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,920
we help Bank contribute to open source

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,990
who can't today

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,460
as I think mal put it very well to when

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,369
he was describing the relationship

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,599
between DX and cloud native to OTP a lot

00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:30,180
of these groups as goal is to get

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,349
requirements for these tools as I

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,060
mentioned I've talked to some banks who

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:34,680
say well we can't contribute to github

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,810
because we think of it as social media

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,910
or external communications other

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,430
organizations said well we consider it a

00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:43,200
code risk or security problem so even

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,940
the requirements of why multiple banks

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,140
and vendors can't contribute is

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,910
different so part of what we're just

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,650
trying to do is instead of speaking well

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,570
okay we all can't contribute let's all

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,670
get to the real compliance legal or

00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,109
policy aspects if it's policy we can

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,880
throw them towards open source readiness

00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:58,200
if it's technical we can take it to the

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,570
actual vendors that's stopping whether

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,070
it's github or Travis or white source or

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,800
whatever the other tools out there need

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:07,440
to be including get lab and everything

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,359
else um and so I think that's also part

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,070
of where the thing is trying to pull

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,440
these requirements and honestly my best

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,660
solution is you can't contribute because

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,339
you think at social media well let's

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,690
talk to these three other banks who are

00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,280
available in this focus group who can

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,500
tell you why they didn't classify this

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,849
social media and try to get your legal

00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,980
or your compliance talking to each other

00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:28,369
so it's not the foundation helping it's

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,640
really the banks helping each other

00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:33,260
thanks

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,260
did it answer the question

00:36:50,230 --> 00:37:12,740
sure right yes yeah so I'm gonna answer

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:15,290
to the non containerized aspect of the

00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:18,170
question I will let die an answer to the

00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:21,410
containerized one we used white source

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:25,150
so you were probably where are you in

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:27,830
the room when David huh Bush presented

00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:32,450
the white source package they gave the

00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:35,960
one to 101 security presentation well we

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:39,290
teamed up with visors white sirs gave us

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,280
a dedicated instance for Finas to scan

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,930
our projects that doesn't mean that all

00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:50,540
he knows hosted projects use white

00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:53,210
source we actually set a requirement for

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:56,330
released for every US for giving a

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:58,760
release badge to our project to actually

00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:01,220
generate a bill of material you can

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,590
generate it manually of course but then

00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,300
white sirs will do it continuously on

00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:08,960
commit so there are some requirements

00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,670
right that the program the PMC the

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
government the government's part of the

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,890
of the finis program required two

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,500
projects to comply to there is

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,480
definitely improvement right so there is

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,910
improvement in the white source products

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,250
are enduring the vendor solutions to be

00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,510
more sensitive to the to the industry

00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,400
requirements and there is definitely

00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,960
improvement on our configuration because

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,560
white source is configured with the

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,830
policies that feena's establishes so the

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,740
build fails if there is I cannot find

00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:43,930
allies a license on a package I just

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:46,340
failed a build that's it if it is

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:49,730
incompatible with the outbound license

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:52,340
for example GPL is not compatible with

00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,530
apache 2 apache 2 is our outbound

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,290
license across all the projects we just

00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,380
raise a flag if there is a security

00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,060
vulnerability

00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:02,120
and so on and so forth so we established

00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:04,550
this policy in white source what happens

00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,580
in the container world I think that the

00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:10,100
yarn is four it's actually quite similar

00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,590
we we have partners like black duck and

00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,530
open-source projects like open scape and

00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,540
that are doing very similar work flows

00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,600
that are built in to part of the

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:22,310
automation when you build your image and

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,400
when you deploy it or when you patch it

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:27,590
so it's it's basically what he described

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,910
for a white source but a different set

00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,790
of tools and different set of vendors

00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:34,460
who are capable of doing that on a

00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:36,470
container and scanning all of the images

00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,510
for everything that's in there and then

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,240
going back and tracing it and where

00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,460
we've come a long way like eight nine

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,800
years ago I worked at a small startup

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,930
called active state doing Python

00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,050
language library and I can remember

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,910
scanning those repos and looking for

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,240
what license was in there and in order

00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:58,100
to package it up so a lot of automation

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,280
has come in since those spreadsheets

00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,200
that I built so suffice to say is that

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,700
there's a lot of great people at Red Hat

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,260
and elsewhere that are thinking about it

00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,360
especially some of the folks at Black

00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,190
Duck as well have done some great and

00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,530
there's a wonderful open source project

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:18,190
called open scape that you can check out

00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:21,290
to to the container question I mean

00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:23,210
Diane mentioned the ODP service catalog

00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:27,040
right so the service catalog is supposed

00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:29,390
to be the showcase of all the Venus

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,720
projects and activities in a

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:35,990
containerized format right that's where

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,740
we probably want to set some security

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:41,570
legal compliance checks as much as we

00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,730
are doing for code right now right

00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,530
because again there is importance to

00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,510
scanning the source code as much as

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,960
there is for scanning binaries and

00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,960
runtimes

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:14,350
think we are the we're done with time

00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,040
thank you very much if you have any

00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:18,550
other question please

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,080
grab-grab me on our see you tomorrow

00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,650
thank you

00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,519
[Applause]

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,519
