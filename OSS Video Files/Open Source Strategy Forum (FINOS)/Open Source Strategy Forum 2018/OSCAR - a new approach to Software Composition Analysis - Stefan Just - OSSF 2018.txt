Presentation: OSCAR - a new approach to Software Composition Analysis

The scale of modern software systems is growing beyond the capability of individuals and teams to keep track of them. This is caused by new software development and deployment technologies, DevOps automation, increasingly powerful hardware and massive use of open source. Traditional proprietary Software Composition Analysis (SCA) products, which were developed to help mitigate Open Source licensing and vulnerability risks, and ensure software is within company policy and industry compliant, have struggled to keep up with this new scale and its modern methods like continuous integration, continuous package updates and agile releases. Because proprietary solutions are unable to keep up, companies are working to build their own internal systems to plug the gaps, which takes away from their core business needs.
 
The Eclipse Foundation recently announced a new project, OSCAR, to solve the problem of scaling SCA to modern needs with an Open Source approach. OSCAR, which stands for Open Software Composition Analysis Reinvented, aims to integrate the new building blocks into a complete installable SCA solution and act as an industry forum to coordinate coherent further development.
 
Different from other “community driven” OSS projects, OSCAR is built around an industry consortium of supporters, which fund and contribute to the project, in an Eclipse Working Group (OpenSCA). Foundation of a Steering Committee, decision meetings on first milestone goals to build as well as first contributions are underway. The talk will explain why SCA is vital for any organization who works with Open Source, the OSCAR’s “hybrid” approach, and give an outlook on what to expect from OSCAR

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,670
this may be a little bit of an unusual

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,160
title for for this conference and it's

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,130
also in a kind of unusual space is the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,160
last presentation of the of the event so

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm hoping not to be too redundant to

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,090
things that we've heard here so we've

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,009
we've had a lot of Education we've heard

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,559
about you know what what is open-source

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,030
how do I use it about processes about

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,360
tools about consultancy and and how

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:46,590
necessary that is about maturity etc so

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,020
this is this is a talk about a tool that

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,000
is right in its infancy

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,590
actually it's not only a tool it's a

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,160
it's a set of tools and we'll understand

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:59,430
a little bit of that a little bit later

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,399
it's called Oscar and you'll know why

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,530
Oscar in a you know in a bit and it's a

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,100
project which is currently being set up

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,970
on the Eclipse Foundation just before we

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,580
start quickly who I am I am from a

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,630
different company so I see myself more

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,420
as the ambassador as ambassador for for

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,110
Oscar I'm working for for a still in

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,400
stealth mode a beam company called code

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,579
scoop and we are a mixed team of people

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,040
that have heavily worked in the software

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,040
composition analysis space before so we

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,360
have had careers that a black dark open

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,060
logic and other companies and and we

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,000
think that working with open source is

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,189
not only about understanding what's in

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,520
their understanding you know the

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,110
forensic view of open source in your in

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,020
your stacks but it's it's really very

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,960
much about getting to use open source as

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,110
much as possible with as well as less at

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,759
least risk as possible and we are

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,340
building software around that and I'm

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,679
seeing the problem that this is no this

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,810
is going back and forth I've had that

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,470
before so bear with me you will see the

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,110
the

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,440
initial screen whenever I'm not talking

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,960
fast enough just you know look strange

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,640
into my eyes and I will I will fix that

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,860
I'm sorry for that so so that's me

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,080
quickly through the agenda so we will

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,550
talk obviously sometimes repeat

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,440
sometimes disclose what SCA is and why

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,110
are we talking about SCA at all I mean

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,420
ACA is obviously a settled discipline

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,670
and it's it's being used in in

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,900
enterprises and by individual people and

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,330
by teams so what is there any problem

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:59,430
with SCA and if yes what could be the

00:02:51,330 --> 00:03:01,380
problems what's already existing so what

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,090
what what are the available tools what

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,830
are the available tools in open source

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,380
and what is what is missing what are the

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,480
the blank spots here and then we are

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,290
diving into Oscar and what that fix is

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,000
of these things so first of all that

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,880
let's let's find a little bit of a

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,280
definition of SCA so obviously essays

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,910
the short form for software composition

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,330
analysis and it typically describes

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,459
tools around understanding what's inside

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,620
your stack when I say your stack

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,380
that's your software the software that

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,400
you're building or operating so it's not

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,600
always always clear that you're using a

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,940
I don't know a web server or a XML

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,269
parser or whatever so first of all it's

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:52,950
around understanding of what is in there

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:54,390
and it's mainly it's mainly sc8 in in

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,060
the sense that we are talking about

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,540
today is mainly around open source and

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,160
that's where the tools exist I'm sorry

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,690
that that I have to do this flipping

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:11,820
here but I don't think there's a

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:14,880
solution for that now so maybe this this

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,790
will be your problem but anyway so it's

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,570
mainly open source but it some of the

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,160
SCA features also apply to to the stacks

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,470
that you have in the enterprise which

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,410
could also be called the inner source

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,360
stacks

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,950
topic areas typically addressed by

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,170
software composition analysis number one

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:40,190
is compliant so to find out what license

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:43,340
are being used and whether or not this

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,840
is a problem if there's obligations that

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,870
need to be fulfilled and how they are

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,620
going to be fulfilled where the good

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:54,680
talk by Jeff today to get clarification

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,540
on that number two topic and you may may

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,700
argue whether one is more important than

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,190
the other is the topic around security

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,000
so is it risky to use open source or any

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,800
other third-party tools so finding out

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,710
about vulnerabilities about possible

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,410
denial of service risks etc so that's

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,050
number two number three is this good

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,780
stuff I mean is it what are the the

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,090
methods to understand what open-source

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,970
components are good and what are bad and

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,540
what means good and bad well supported

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:33,650
well maintainable etc and finally last

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,410
not least it's also about cost so costs

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,780
of of using open-source software in

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,419
terms of you know you need to review

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,040
open source components to understand

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,340
whether what they do if they do it well

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,340
who is behind the cetera but also you

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,500
need to think about how how costly or

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,320
not costly is it to maintain what you're

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,660
using support if you don't want to do it

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,820
yourself is there a possible support etc

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,830
so this would be typical topic topic

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,580
areas of SCA so I started with saying

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,030
license compliance and security

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:12,979
management are typically disciplines

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:15,950
addressed by today's today's offerings

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:20,510
well whether it be commercial offerings

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:22,040
or open-source offerings but there and

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,050
there may be there may be other other

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,750
interesting topic errors also around the

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,790
usage of open source so for example

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,800
whether or not you are able and allowed

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,300
to export

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,750
the resulting software when they're

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,250
using open-source pieces how you talk

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,889
with your supply chain you know what

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:48,460
what what does that matter if you if you

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:53,360
need to give software to to customers or

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:55,639
OMS then then this could be a problem

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,830
and there are there are solutions for

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,120
that but maybe there there's more

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,759
elegance to be done

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,990
we talked quickly about quality

00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,599
functional analysis the problem to

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,030
understand what the what the component

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,250
does I mean if you know what you're what

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,810
you're searching for you're in a good

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,120
shape but if you don't if you just have

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,630
a rough idea of a problem that you need

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,500
to solve

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,630
I need a whatever I I need a graphical

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,819
library that allows me to display

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,310
transparent data in three-dimension

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:28,130
format and liquid and whatever you how

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,889
do you find that so identifying and

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:35,030
describing functional functional

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:37,099
behavior of of components you may want

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,550
to understand a little bit more about

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:44,139
the complexity of the components that

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,969
has to do with maintainability of course

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,669
you may want to understand how general

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:53,150
general or generic a component is so the

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,610
whole topic of architecture obligations

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,620
again we with several talks about that

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,900
obligation management so when when you

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,349
are aware of something that you need to

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,139
do who is helping you with that what you

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,909
know who tells you what you need to do

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,580
if you need to deliver the source code

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,560
who tells you what you have to do if you

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,199
have to report an export violation

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,719
because your software can't be exported

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,050
to a certain country so this this whole

00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:23,330
management then then going upstream or

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,949
all the topics like contribution and

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,130
distributions over actually there's like

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:30,469
different topics so contribution to

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,240
open-source platforms and and project

00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,899
but also distribution if you want to

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,789
distribute your code you know is that is

00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:42,050
that a no-brainer or not and last not

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:46,010
least support again so if if you want to

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,730
take a kind of 30,000 foot view point on

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,709
that

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,630
all of that that I've just described

00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:52,459
would be typically functionalities they

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,089
lead to a certain architecture and they

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:58,250
they lead to describable features but

00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,860
you can also an F that's technology you

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,699
know that's stuff that you need to build

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,829
that's almost the easiest part but then

00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:10,040
if you want to create something

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:11,899
meaningful you also may need to or want

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,850
to understand about what what is the

00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,220
value for me what's the value for my

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,800
enterprise for my for my business model

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,290
what's the purpose is is that a

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,720
different way of sourcing I mean just

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,690
just downloading something is one way

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,389
but is there maybe more to just having

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,070
free access to software so that those

00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:36,709
are those are thoughts that you could

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:39,589
have and then managing such a tool and a

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,839
project around these these tools implies

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,820
things like thinking about the

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,000
governance that you need about the

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:50,089
organization of the project etc and

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,160
defining a certain process so that's all

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,630
the environment that you need to that

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,209
you need to look at if you are looking

00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:01,190
at at open source projects whether it be

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:03,620
for tools or for something else that's

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,610
all the same so this is this is what we

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:11,029
this is what we've seen and we is you

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,880
know just almost accidentally is is

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,819
myself and a couple of other people when

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,339
we've spoken to larger software

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:22,160
producers so this shows these are

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,589
examples from a conference that was

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,500
happening in October this year and these

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,750
are examples from from Siemens this is

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,149
not some from here this would be an

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,440
example from sa P and that would be an

00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,620
example from Bosch and the common

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,779
denominator is when they show on in a

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,760
conference that talks about you know

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:44,750
what are we using how are we addressing

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:52,459
the open source problem or the open

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:54,170
source topic this this this is this is

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:57,860
how they express themselves so you

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,970
always have components in in the in the

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,129
case of here this is very heavily open

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,949
loaded so the tool set is very heavily

00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:08,339
around open sauce in the turn in the

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:10,620
case of Siemens there's a central

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,050
component which is again an open-source

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,250
tool to do scanning pathology which just

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:20,009
a certain way of scan your software

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,199
stack and then there's then there's AP

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,870
telling the world that automation of

00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:27,600
compliance is possible if you do some

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,120
restrictions and they again they have

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,779
built stuff around commercial tools and

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:37,410
then there's bosch saying we solve

00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:40,110
inventory problems with with open source

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,410
in that case software 360 and we you

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,230
know combine them with other things that

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,050
are either commercial self built or open

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,379
source and and that's all structure so

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,730
the common denominator here is there's a

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,040
lot of spending involved there's

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:01,069
spending for some of the tools involved

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:04,680
so this is this is a combination of of

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:07,649
buying or licensing tools using open

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,959
source tools and and doing your own work

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,329
with dashboards etc so there's there's a

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,189
lot of spending but if you look at this

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,529
the not only are the pictures different

00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,110
but but they use all different stuff

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:23,449
that's not inside here is that all of

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:25,709
these all of these guys are also using

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:28,470
commercially available SCA tools and

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:30,930
typically they're using not only one but

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,199
they may use two or even more SCA tools

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:37,709
so at this conference we had some some

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,209
samples of as of commercial SCA vendors

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,850
and they have their strengths and their

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:47,040
their weaknesses but the comedy not

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,809
denominator other than that most of do

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,610
most of them do some kind of scanning

00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:56,550
some kind of vulnerability management

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:59,779
the common denominator is that that one

00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,779
size doesn't fit all okay

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:12,140
no fine reuse in that context yeah

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,100
no no absolutely that's it that's a good

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,120
question

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,100
reuse of of that of that stuff

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,990
so everybody builds their own dashboards

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,480
everybody builds their own processes

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,880
everybody has their take of using stuff

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,130
sometimes there is reuse that that's

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,990
what I'm saying oh I hope I'm saying

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,960
little ríos yeah I'm saying litoris and

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,370
no REO so in in in the concrete example

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,830
bosch and Siemens they are up they are

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,810
using software 360 but they are doing

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,890
different things with with around that

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,420
so that's the reuse of the customized

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:50,980
software that's happening in this

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,980
company is is countable makes sense

00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:01,230
okay so okay so so again the the

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:05,670
observation the observation here is

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:10,060
there is a combination of using

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:12,400
proprietary tools custom development and

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:16,060
that custom development is typically not

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,890
reused from from not only from company

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,710
to company but also inside the company

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,950
it's not always centrally managed and

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,510
and deployed for everybody but it's

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:34,150
definitely not used across companies and

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:35,920
the other observation is that that these

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,470
companies have scanty available open

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,840
source tools and just found Islands and

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,020
what does that mean they've just found

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,970
functionalities which which covers

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,190
certain functionalities but there's

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:52,000
nothing that is the big the big hit so

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:54,670
in in in summary there is duplicated or

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,100
even more spending for the combination

00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:02,620
of commercial SCA tools and building

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:04,630
stuff yourself so what else did we hear

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,800
and when we say we there is there's this

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:11,430
this series of conversations that that

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,110
myself and and colleagues we're

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,770
involving companies like the ones that

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,990
have been named into and those were

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,700
typical quotes that we hear so people

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,250
said well there's currently a

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,280
consolidation on the tool vendor side

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,380
which is true there's a lot of buying

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,870
and also disappearing on the market

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,470
there are some new ones that have more

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:37,510
or less success so the bigger

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,630
development shops they think this is not

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,310
per se healthy so a a merger can be a

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,550
good thing but it doesn't have to so

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:48,940
sometimes the the acquiring company

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:51,310
thinks that that they have to change the

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:54,280
direction or they have to refocus so

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:57,310
that that comes with with possible

00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:01,090
problems we've heard very often that the

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,820
data the underlying the underlying data

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,020
needs to be open and bi-directional what

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,480
does that mean

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,630
the the the proprietary solutions

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,130
typically their assets are the data this

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:17,890
is working on so we've heard a lot that

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:21,300
making changes to that data or additions

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,620
to that data or even adding their own

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,690
assets to the data is typically

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,080
difficult so that was a complaint that

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,690
we heard another thing that we heard is

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:35,470
more a procedural problem that has

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,000
nothing to do with the tool vendors but

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,620
it has to do with the tool vendors also

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,810
because typically they are set up in a

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,640
way that these tools are operated in an

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,310
ivory tower if you want so they are not

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,560
typically operated by developers or

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,230
architects or or teams that are at the

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,240
beginning of the tool chain but they are

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:58,570
very often the processes include you

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,130
know throwing software into a department

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,420
and that's typically called the open

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,860
source office and and things are being

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,780
analyzed there and then a result comes

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,850
back which is either thumbs up or thumbs

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,220
down or something in the in the middle

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,010
so there were complaints there people

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,680
want to be more agile they want to be

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,890
shifting left more and and that's what

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,630
typically typical solutions don't allow

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,510
then open source management is more than

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,950
license scan that's a that's a comment

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,350
that we heard a lot so it's not only

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,450
about scanning stuff and and you know

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,110
pointing fingers open source management

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,690
starts at selection and then goes the

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,070
full circle and part of that is also

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,870
scanning but it's completely not all

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,820
existing open source offers promising

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,840
but small so that that means again some

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,240
explanation so so many of the of the

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,400
existing open source alternatives exist

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,920
and they they they have some quality and

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,610
they have some some sometimes they are

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,410
better in in areas than commercial tools

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,950
but very often they are supported

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,690
supported only by very small teams these

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,290
teams are sometimes are very often

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,630
embedded into bigger enterprises but the

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,020
teams are usually very small so there's

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,110
a lot of

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,260
one two men shows and there's some that

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,059
are supported by five people so and

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,679
that's typically the size of the team so

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:28,100
there is again there's a little risk in

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,230
the open-source offering that if these

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,320
one or two people lose interest or

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,419
they're moving on then the whole

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,529
potentially interesting offering is not

00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:41,870
is not well anymore and last not least

00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:44,000
talking about costs commercial SCA

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,240
offerings are not cheap so there are

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,510
some some some levels of differences but

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,580
they typically come with with with a

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:57,260
price tag and if you have to use two or

00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:02,870
more then this gets even worse okay so

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:05,450
let's let's dive into Oscar now Oscar

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,320
obviously stands for open like open

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,380
source software composition analyzes and

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,220
then there's there's different

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:17,919
interpretations about the are reload

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,960
revent it I prefer the rethought today

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,240
this is where Oscar is actually not I

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,820
mean it's it's probably a little bit

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,010
more like that so there's a lot of there

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,000
has been a lot of thought processes with

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:34,220
with a team that I'm going to introduce

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,220
soon there are there are building blocks

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,850
which may or may not be used and there's

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:45,260
also a lot of demand so these these

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:48,799
demands here these are directly from a

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,470
workshop that has been conducted in well

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,850
that has been conducted with with the

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,950
team of again industry potential

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,380
supporters of Oscar and the gray ones

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,350
are yeah that would be great but the the

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:08,899
orange ones were agreed by the crowd to

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:10,850
be to be prioritized focused etc and not

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:12,470
going through all of them and probably

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,750
going to be a victim of this

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,090
disappearing again but but common sense

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,640
common sense was around integration

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,289
integration integration so this is both

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,110
integration into the developers

00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:27,380
workspace so so there can be analysis

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,669
done right away but again but also in

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,379
integration into

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:35,359
the CI and DevOps scenarios so there

00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:37,369
must be some automation possible so

00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,639
everything that can be automated should

00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:43,460
be automated in that field quality is a

00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:45,259
little cluster of of things ten minutes

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,859
for responses that that that came from

00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:52,759
more than then one of the one of the

00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:54,440
members there just to address that it

00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,659
typically takes weeks or even months for

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,700
for analysis to come back and and then

00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:01,539
you know you have all the problems that

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,330
you have when things are delayed

00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:07,070
identification also of binary stuff

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,149
including pictures including executables

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,519
etc

00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:11,869
where's obligation management I don't

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,480
know snippets scanner and data that's

00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:16,909
you may have heard about this during

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,559
this conference that's still important

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,389
if you are working with compiled

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,259
languages so you want to understand if

00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:27,499
there is modifications of of source code

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,580
in C or C plus C plus plus for example

00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:32,210
languages

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:39,470
so so that's that's been discussed and

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:42,679
aligned between between six members six

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:47,450
potential members which are here Siemens

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:49,850
Bosch sa P Cisco and Ericsson so you

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,919
know companies of some weight and

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,230
there's I mean this is this is only

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,230
saying that that they expressed an

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,629
opinion to this it's not carved in stone

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,049
that they will be supporters but there

00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:06,739
is there is expressed interest in in

00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:10,070
this topic a little bit of a five bullet

00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:12,230
journey through what what is will be

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,649
addressed by Oscar and again this is not

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,419
this is not my or our invention this is

00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:21,499
something that that came back from from

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:24,049
these users so number one the important

00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:26,929
thing here is continue so Oscar will be

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:29,450
an open source solution for continuous

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,369
software composition and now this again

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,929
starting with compliance and security

00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,149
but in the long run addressing also

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:37,940
other other stuff continuous means not

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:41,340
living somewhere in the lab in the in an

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,090
open source center but

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:49,650
being part of the of the lifecycle

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,059
management and being caught as early as

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,870
possible and used as early as possible

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,600
number two and it it will be a software

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,929
distribution so currently existing there

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,160
are many single functionalities that

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:06,329
will change and there will be certain

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,329
[Music]

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,450
instances of Oskar being packaged as

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:19,490
distribution that's a non trivial it

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:24,390
looks more trivial than it is because it

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:26,040
it involves also taking in other

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,140
open-source offerings that may not be

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,510
under the same license and you know

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,660
there's there's some challenges but the

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:38,820
goal is that you can go to a to a site

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:43,320
and download the the Oskar system as a

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,900
as a full distribution and that's that's

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,120
going to be on a small notebook and and

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,679
on a team server and also in the cloud

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:55,440
and again I just mentioned it's going to

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,240
be existing and new open-source building

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,850
blocks existing block blocks will be

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,549
talked about right in the next slide and

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,309
you yeah there's stuff to be built so we

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,640
started in this in this group we started

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:10,740
to build software and that's going to be

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,049
inside the Oskar project it's also going

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,309
to be an architecture and an application

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:19,140
bus so that seems trivial but it's we

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:22,230
believe that that it's a good idea to

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,419
start with with the specification of how

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,270
things go together if you if you pull in

00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,130
different sources from from commercial

00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,990
and on commercial tools you need to make

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,880
sure they speak to each other so that's

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,850
one of the first things that will be

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,280
defined and will be in the in the format

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,240
of a of a message bus that's the very

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,220
first one and then there will be

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,090
discussions around data storage etc

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,940
which is necessary fourth point is this

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:53,309
cannot fly if it's just an open source

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,540
project so if if it's just being started

00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,490
somewhere

00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,040
and then everybody sits back and waits

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,570
until somebody contributes that's not

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,330
going to fly and that's that's a little

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,090
bit the role of of the people like

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,520
myself we are orchestrating this initial

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:14,929
you know pushing it over the clip cliff

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:20,190
kind of activities and and the the the

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:22,320
industry coordination will be organized

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,990
in the way of an eclipse working group

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,480
and I'm going to talk about that just a

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:30,570
little bit later so again not number

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:35,580
four is is crucial for this to be

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:39,540
successful and and fly and the fifth but

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,370
not least important point is this is the

00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,100
production setup will be organized under

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,870
the Eclipse Foundation and they have

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:51,660
methods to do that they have they have

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:54,870
good standard processes etc so so they

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:58,049
will be a good home I just mentioned if

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,150
I'm very sorry that this happens and I

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:01,650
have no explanation but anyway so I just

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:07,169
mentioned that there are that there are

00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:08,700
already existing parts out there and in

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:10,590
the in the scanner area for example

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,160
there is source code scanning by

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:16,169
pathology and scan code in the more

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:19,679
package oriented scanner area there's

00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:21,780
the open source resource toolkit there's

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,799
grass and there's quartermaster they

00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,940
they do similar stuff there is

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,640
where's-where's clearly-defined there's

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,640
data sources coming and being supported

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,850
from by Microsoft and others their

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,950
software heritage which is all around

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,900
making sure that nothing is of

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,270
information is getting lost because open

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,690
source also ages so if you look for

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,940
something that is already 10 years old

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,910
it may not be there where it was in the

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,510
beginning so they solve that problem so

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:57,440
in total there is there is stuff to

00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,480
start with and these are all all

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,090
offerings that we have you know started

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,360
to speak to gather their interest

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,360
we've also kind of

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,920
valued them whether or not they are as I

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,750
said one-man show of two and trolls five

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,720
and Shoals and who's behind it and

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:19,460
that's that's the the the meaning of the

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,610
of the quoting who is who is behind that

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:26,179
who's supporting that so typically if

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,559
you if you look at or RT for example the

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:29,450
open source resource toolkit

00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:33,020
then it's a small project with

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:35,360
interesting functionality but all of the

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,580
guys are working for here and they are

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,780
they have the backup from from the here

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:44,929
company to do this so it's it's a bit of

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,809
twofold those are not garage projects

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:52,100
those are projects that are very often

00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:54,710
supported by by bigger shops and there's

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,230
also been some talk I don't want to be

00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,169
too technical here on and also cannot

00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,990
but there's there's you know thinking

00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:05,410
within this group of how architecture

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:08,929
should like should look like I was

00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:12,950
speaking about the the bus that has been

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:16,160
designed so you know giving giving all

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,470
that there is there's a solid backup and

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,080
support not just by visionary

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,090
visionaries like like us maybe but

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,059
there's some some big names behind that

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:28,790
both in the form of of software that is

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:31,190
already being committed but also in in

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:34,850
the form of people saying we could be

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,669
interested in support Oscar so all this

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,080
together basically means Oscar if you

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:40,610
remember this this white part at the

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,900
beginning it's not a greenfield project

00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:46,400
so there is there is there's the

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,200
existing modules if you remember that

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,780
slide there is an architecture there is

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,380
initial talking there is there's some

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,880
some industry back up so we are not

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,419
starting from scratch here and we are

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,610
starting with a lot of enthusiasm I

00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,110
would say so I mentioned this working

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,140
group and and this is this is

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,210
terminology here so Oscar is is

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,770
basically the the technical if you want

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,960
the technical project based on the

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,660
Eclipse Foundation everybody can

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,190
contribute everybody that thinks he or

00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,800
she has something to say can be part of

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,230
it and this will also be a

00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:25,520
well buckets to to to get all these

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:27,890
smaller project and at least pamper them

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,050
not all of them are having eclipse

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,860
license which would be necessary if they

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:38,030
are a full a full member of the Oscar

00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:42,530
project but but you know it is it is

00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:44,870
possible to give them a new home and

00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,410
open SCA that's the name of the working

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,470
group the Eclipse working group that is

00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:52,820
that is consisting of these these

00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,220
industry members that I quoted there are

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,610
some already available for a second

00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,200
round the first round will be very much

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,860
Europe center the next round will

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:08,360
probably go much into much more into a

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,250
international space so with the open SCA

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,950
working group we are in the process of

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:16,100
finalizing the Charter which is the the

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:21,140
basically the the Bible for a working

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:25,250
group and yeah so the the working group

00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:27,620
is in in being established and Oscar is

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,630
already existing and and this is like

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,130
being in the delivery room it's it's

00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,170
like you know getting a baby so some

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,570
things have been done already Oscar and

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:38,990
open SCA have been officially launched

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:42,230
at the Eclipse con back in October in

00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:45,950
Germany the the industry consortium

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:49,280
meeting the first one has has been done

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,740
at the end of October the legal

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,810
paperwork is underway there is some

00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,790
paperwork that's being demanded by the

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,130
Eclipse Foundation and there's some

00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,780
corresponding paperwork that is all

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:04,570
around you know funding and financing

00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:08,030
which which is happening in parallel and

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:11,600
the the next actions have been decided

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:14,060
basically the the official kickoff

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,340
meeting in the second half of January

00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:21,040
January and some some things have been

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:25,490
established like a common document area

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,530
slack channel that everybody is in we

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,710
have currently established by weekly

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,720
calls and we're still looking for for

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,520
people to

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,900
to come in so just go to the Eclipse

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,780
Foundation look for Oscar and you will

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,960
be brought to what it takes to

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,809
eventually contribute or look at the

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,080
first results

00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:54,850
so in summary and this hopefully brings

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,250
me brings me home in time if you

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,830
remember the the initial problem

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:03,460
statement that we had so the the the

00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:05,380
problems that were heard from from a

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,260
number of people that we have

00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:11,049
interviewed and spoken to those were

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,059
problems around the market is developing

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,090
into a direction which is hard to

00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:18,700
predict we would like to have data and

00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:21,429
tools open visible and transparent

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:25,450
that's that's not always the case we see

00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:27,580
that that through some of the

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,409
consolidations we are not sure whether

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,470
the tools that we have that way of

00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:34,450
license will remain in function and will

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:38,080
have the same focus and be furtherly

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:40,900
developed we have a problem with this

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,559
ivory tower scenario that is that is

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:47,950
very often being implied by the existing

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,730
tool so so these would be the answers to

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:55,659
those concerns obviously open stands for

00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:58,330
open source open source addresses occur

00:32:55,659 --> 00:33:01,630
a possible vendor locking so you are

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:04,230
you're in the driver seat yourself and

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,549
that is true for open source and data so

00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,039
transfer is transparency on the data

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,860
being able to commit to the data is

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,150
important for many and it allows for if

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,789
you want for crowd QA in the data so

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:22,690
it's it possibly allows for quicker

00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:25,330
addition to to the the necessary

00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,130
databases that could be one stream that

00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,400
that is established in the in the Oscar

00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:32,860
project allowing developers to put their

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,230
new revision data into the database

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,730
instead of waiting for somebody to you

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,120
know browse what's happening and then

00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:43,960
then looking at it again so that's

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,960
that's addressing that part shifting

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,480
left of

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,210
talked about so it starts starts where

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,990
code is being produced so some some of

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:56,600
us dream about something like a almost

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,720
real-time behavior so somebody is

00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,610
looking for open source code it's making

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,120
this decision with or without the help

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:07,250
of Oscar and puts the data into his or

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,520
her stack and then Oscar will determine

00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,679
that and say hey um by the way this is

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,909
this is good stuff I just wanted to

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,190
remind you that the license isn't

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,740
fitting to that policy and maybe it's

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,679
the best time now to to look at the

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,230
consequences and/or let me allow me to

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,470
flag this so for later scanning it's

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:31,550
already pre-populated so that would be

00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:34,570
that lets need to be to build custom

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:38,859
patches the one that that that I was

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:43,909
addressing to also with your question so

00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:45,530
current current situation is neither the

00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,409
commercial tools nor the open-source

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:51,889
tools if they stand alone will will will

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:54,260
run it completely so let's need to build

00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,800
custom patches in terms of this will be

00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:01,190
completely solved within the Oscar

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,250
project and hopefully and the the

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:07,820
addressing of small team small solution

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:10,520
teams possibly causing problems if they

00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,160
fall down so who takes over if they are

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,650
all in in a in a bigger context that

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,170
addresses that so if if people have to

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,230
move on then if they are part of Oscar

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,359
then this gives at least the opportunity

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:27,380
for the for the sub projects to be

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,780
continued and you know I think we've

00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,369
we've seen enough examples of that it

00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,880
doesn't have to stop at compliance and

00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:36,320
security and it's since it's an open

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,680
source project it will be free for

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,869
consumers and alternative sourcing paths

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,000
for drivers so for those members that

00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:48,830
put effort budget contribution in they

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,869
can see it as an alternative way of

00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,580
sourcing software so there is you know

00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:54,859
just taking stuff from the open source

00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,900
tech and taking it as it as it works

00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,260
there is buying software and there may

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,500
be a middle way of inflow

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:05,250
sensing certain contributions to

00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:08,300
open-source tax just by actively

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:12,450
contributing energy and money and stuff

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,880
so again happy to have more contributors

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:18,390
to ask our and more members of the open

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,610
SCA and that's it and now I didn't

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:29,150
overshoot with all these technical

00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:29,150
problems any remaining questions

00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:49,100
yeah well the pathology would be a an

00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:52,190
interesting integral part that addresses

00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,590
a very specific need which is looking

00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:59,830
with a specific mechanism at source-code

00:36:54,590 --> 00:37:04,100
looking for copyright looking for for

00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,630
quotations of origins etc and bringing

00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,410
on the results so that's that's a good

00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:11,360
start everything that's connected just

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,830
in this in the scanning in this analysis

00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,530
area everything that's connected to

00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:19,610
finding out similarities changed code

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,680
snippets refactored code etc which still

00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,570
is relevant because it still has an

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,640
origin in a open source component but

00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,940
it's not one-to-one identical would not

00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:33,110
be would not be covered by bios ecology

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:36,740
now one answer could be you know to ask

00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:39,380
the the likes of flex era and synopsis

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,930
they do this kind of stuff but then the

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,790
next question would be so what about for

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,510
example obligation management that is

00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:49,400
customizable and that has you know that

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:53,180
so so it's it's if you if you think

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,840
onions its photo ology and then more and

00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,840
more and more

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,240
I'm not sure all this in an open-source

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,890
project because the very end of

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,370
pathology that we are using inside

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:22,250
Siemens has two major differences to the

00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:24,740
community version and one is that you

00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:37,160
have to specialized - optics port which

00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:39,200
is used so I'm not sure why why why this

00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,940
custom I mean if that's what being

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,890
conservative custom patched and that

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,080
wouldn't make sense to contributed and

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,880
the second thing is we have adapted into

00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,790
our internal single sign-on system

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,220
within the organization and that's also

00:38:49,790 --> 00:39:01,960
something I think every open-source

00:38:52,220 --> 00:39:01,960
project will likely have organizations

00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:12,680
and I think probably as well okay fair

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,020
fair comment and I think I may have

00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,700
expressed myself not clear enough with

00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,530
this glue with this whole patching thing

00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,050
so I'll give you a give you some

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,600
alternative examples or Ericsson for

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,640
example they and they speak about that

00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,910
openly so I can disclose that here

00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,810
they spent seven digit figures of

00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:36,350
creating inventories creating dashboards

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:39,410
creating process systems that that

00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:41,390
creating security routing systems which

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,700
they don't find a solution for in the

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,400
market and that those are those that

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:49,400
would be typical patches or edition

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,150
software additions to there they're

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,560
normally commercial tools and they're

00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,530
open source tools which they also use

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,750
and that is unique that's that's that's

00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,330
a value of a couple of million euros or

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,250
whatever dollars and that's not

00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:08,210
transferable to any other situation so

00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:10,430
the idea is is with Oscar to take away a

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,050
little bit of that replace it with

00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,390
something that's meaningful also for

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:17,000
others and and by that reducing the

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,980
amount of customer custom customized

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,960
software

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:25,180
this is the erickson case really about

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:35,950
running the office now it's it's it's

00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:38,380
not yeah yeah that that's right that's

00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,840
right money money is for development

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,480
shops like that is not the point but

00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,430
focusing is is an important point I mean

00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,750
they are saying we're building software

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,910
but we shouldn't build software for

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:52,119
stuff that we can sell or that is not in

00:40:48,910 --> 00:41:40,450
the core of our business so I I would

00:40:52,119 --> 00:41:45,780
agree to your peer assessment I fully

00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,780
agree yeah that's right

00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,150
correct that that's one that's one of

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,880
the things so so there seems to be a

00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,740
common sense about exactly what you said

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,660
there's a lot of quality coming into

00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,000
existence and there's a lot of variety

00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,510
also there's a lot of overlap there

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,910
needs there's need for an instance to to

00:42:52,510 --> 00:43:01,240
funnel that and to connect that exactly

00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:03,580
so it's for for many situations just

00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,920
okay to take this and this and this and

00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,200
build your own thing with limited effort

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,420
for other situations especially when it

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,490
needs to scale this is not the right way

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,710
so the the both aspects of quality is

00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,710
being being produced and is coming into

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,840
existence but very often it's it's a

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,750
thin layer of this being further

00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:29,820
developed or dying for all the reasons

00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,820
that open source has and good reasons

00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:36,760
quo Tomas is a good example but but

00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:41,800
Karma's also is a good example of a very

00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,869
small team I mean there and - so if if

00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,590
they commit to doing this for the rest

00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:49,200
of their lives

00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:49,200
all is good but how sure can you be

00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:00,039
that is that is right that's right and

00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,259
by the way we or myself we are we are

00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:04,239
trying to pull out as quickly as

00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:06,430
possible we don't want to be the next

00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,309
end of code or the next whatever redhead

00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,170
or that you know by embracing everything

00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:13,029
creates a business model that's not

00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,890
going to happen so we we believe that

00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:16,479
it's necessary to get especially bigger

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:19,449
enterprises that are producing software

00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:22,239
to you know move there how can I say

00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,979
that politely to move their legs into a

00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,789
certain direction or and that's that's

00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:30,670
what we see as our task here and then it

00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:33,699
this needs to be completely democratic

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,979
and completely you know on stable feet

00:44:33,699 --> 00:45:12,279
within the eclipse organization if

00:44:35,979 --> 00:45:14,349
that's system IDs yeah exactly so it

00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:17,799
will it will plug in to build systems to

00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:20,859
be to serve automation tasks wherever

00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:23,529
possible I'm personally not convinced

00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:26,829
that that this is completely autumn eyes

00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:28,719
able but it also should live very close

00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:31,599
to the developer in their IDE so they

00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,039
can do a quick look at you know where

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,180
does this come from what are the

00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,630
obligations and then make their

00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,630
judgments

00:45:43,970 --> 00:46:08,430
yeah I I would good good point I mean

00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:10,590
this discussion is a good proof for why

00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,750
it will be necessary to create a basis

00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,330
in form of an Enterprise Service bus and

00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:18,540
an application service bus because it

00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:21,810
all of these all of these existing tools

00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,220
have api's they all are some but you

00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,470
don't want the situation where you want

00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,240
to understand you know how much s PDX is

00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,940
this is this is supporting and this is

00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,700
in both ways and and how to combine this

00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,000
with that you want a common SP DX

00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:40,800
actually is also good good candidate for

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,510
an analogy why this makes sense it's for

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,320
my personal taste it should be much

00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:49,020
further by now after after years it

00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,590
should it should be the backbone for for

00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:56,580
supply chain management systems whether

00:46:52,590 --> 00:47:00,650
I know I know and that's why I'm that's

00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,650
why I'm daring this lively discussion

00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,900
okay thanks to seven all right

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,459
[Applause]

00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,459
