Presentation: OSCAR - a new approach to Software Composition Analysis

The scale of modern software systems is growing beyond the capability of individuals and teams to keep track of them. This is caused by new software development and deployment technologies, DevOps automation, increasingly powerful hardware and massive use of open source. Traditional proprietary Software Composition Analysis (SCA) products, which were developed to help mitigate Open Source licensing and vulnerability risks, and ensure software is within company policy and industry compliant, have struggled to keep up with this new scale and its modern methods like continuous integration, continuous package updates and agile releases. Because proprietary solutions are unable to keep up, companies are working to build their own internal systems to plug the gaps, which takes away from their core business needs.
 
The Eclipse Foundation recently announced a new project, OSCAR, to solve the problem of scaling SCA to modern needs with an Open Source approach. OSCAR, which stands for Open Software Composition Analysis Reinvented, aims to integrate the new building blocks into a complete installable SCA solution and act as an industry forum to coordinate coherent further development.
 
Different from other “community driven” OSS projects, OSCAR is built around an industry consortium of supporters, which fund and contribute to the project, in an Eclipse Working Group (OpenSCA). Foundation of a Steering Committee, decision meetings on first milestone goals to build as well as first contributions are underway. The talk will explain why SCA is vital for any organization who works with Open Source, the OSCAR’s “hybrid” approach, and give an outlook on what to expect from OSCAR
