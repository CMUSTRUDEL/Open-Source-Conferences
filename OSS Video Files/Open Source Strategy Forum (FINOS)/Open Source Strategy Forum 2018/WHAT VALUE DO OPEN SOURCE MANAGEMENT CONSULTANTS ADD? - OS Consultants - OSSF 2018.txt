Presentation: WHAT VALUE DO OPEN SOURCE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS ADD?

Reaping the full advantages of Open Source Software while adequately managing the risks is unfortunately quite complicated. For instance – what advantages are realistically available to your company through open source?
 
Is your open source strategy optimized to achieve the maximum technological, financial, organizational and reputational benefits?
 
How can you best leverage an open source strategy to increase developer productivity, motivation, recruitment and retention?
 
How can an inner source strategy help improve your software development productivity?

What policies are required to manage the use of OSS in your company to efficiently and effectively meet your objectives and manage risk?
What processes will implement your policies in the most productive manner?
What tools and tool integrations will best support development efficiency and reliable compliance with your new and existing processes?
How best to deploy an open source program in your already complex environment of people, organizations and processes.
 

There is no question that deep experience in each of these areas is a real advantage in addressing the complex issues.
 
This panel of deeply experienced open source consultants will discuss the key issues for companies building open source programs and how their consulting teams provide critical support in planning, development and execution. Real examples from the financial services industry will be emphasized.

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:18,119
okay welcome everyone this panel is

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,480
about how to use and get the most out of

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,789
management consultants for building out

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,640
your open source processes and policies

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:31,980
we have on our panel three consultants

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,170
from three separate consulting outfits

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,260
and I think that they represent sort of

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,360
a range of the the sort of sizes and

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,480
shapes of consultancies that you might

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,840
work with so here immediately to my

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,320
right standing in for andrew aiken from

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,530
whipper o who was stranded in denver by

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,579
snow and other misery and couldn't make

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,239
it to London

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,570
we have Toby legião from grok are from

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,850
unlock open a solo consultancy at the

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,739
moment I believe to his right we have

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,770
Greg Olson from open source sense

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,220
formerly Linux Foundation consulting is

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,510
that something something like that and

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,710
to his right we have Malcolm Herbert

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:20,700
from Red Hat consultant consulting so I

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,350
think we're going to first have each of

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,650
the panelists give a short introduction

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,680
to themselves and and the into their

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,310
consulting practices and then I'm going

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,960
to moderate but I from the moment they

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,420
finished with their introductions this

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,310
is open to the audience for your

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,020
questions I know that in most of the

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,600
sessions throughout this this week

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,799
you've had relatively little opportunity

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,790
for QA and so you should consider this

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,009
fully open to your participation

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,270
throughout so without further

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:57,210
introduction I will pass the mic to Toby

00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:00,180
well hello everyone so basically what I

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,040
do is I help corporations understand the

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,500
value of contributing to open source

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,750
I think corporations understand really

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,700
well how open source how using open

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,129
source can benefit them but there's

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,140
still a lot to help them was

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,209
understanding the value of contributing

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,650
back

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,220
yeah so that's that's my main focus

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,220
right now

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,040
hi I'm Greg Olsen and I'm one of the

00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:33,890
principals at open source sense we're a

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,959
specialized consultancy that focuses on

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,500
the intersection of open source software

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,730
and business our team has been at this

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,040
for a little more than 12 years now in a

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,630
number another number of different

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,120
contexts originally we were a

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,470
specialized consultancy called Alliance

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,930
group at a Silicon Valley we were

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:01,430
purchased snapped up by Black Duck

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,790
software and altered to bolster the use

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,920
of their products to manage open source

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,400
as Black Duck moved into the security

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,310
space we migrated our consultancy to the

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,290
Linux Foundation and now we're an

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,150
independent group we still do a lot of

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,150
work with them but it was not reasonable

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,920
for us to be incorporated under the same

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,940
umbrella due to non-disclosure

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,250
agreements of all things we have done a

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,769
lot of work in the area of open source

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,790
strategies which is how do you use open

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:38,780
source to the advantage of your business

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,970
and that includes strategies to use open

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,510
source to establish new standards status

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,540
strategies to establish a capability in

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:53,139
the market for less cost than the

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,700
typical commercial waste approaches to

00:03:53,139 --> 00:04:00,170
gain advantage in a market that's

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,150
already dominated by big players these

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,870
are some of the typical ways that

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,609
open-source can be used to do this the

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,000
other thing that we do is is open source

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:14,569
management and that is typically around

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,329
policy and process and implementation

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,789
planning for those processes in other

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,979
words the nuts and bolts of getting a

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,919
return on investment and getting it

00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:27,169
safely within your organization at this

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,020
point we've worked with

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,509
quite a bit over 300 companies in

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,080
financial services we have done open

00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:43,159
source management programs for Deutsche

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:48,159
Bank's Citigroup UBS fidelity

00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:50,990
investments and the US Federal Reserve

00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:54,560
so we've got a pretty good orientation

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,499
to the particular aspects of open source

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,949
management in the financial services

00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:03,080
industry thanks Greg yeah so Malcolm

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,129
Herbert from Red Hat and I look after a

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,719
small group now I'm the chief

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,460
technologist for Red Hat Services in a

00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,110
mere and as a part of that I look after

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,449
small group which is the open source

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,219
practice we've been providing consulting

00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,870
and we don't do management consulting

00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:16,939
for anybody watching the video Jim we

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,939
don't do management consulting but we do

00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,949
provide advisory services around open

00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:24,259
source policy and governance and

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,629
strategy and we've we've increased that

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,979
sort of remit we don't really just know

00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:30,560
that primary aim but we're getting

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,750
increasingly asked to do it and the draw

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,849
with that now is rather than consumption

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,680
of open source and there's been lot this

00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,509
week about with these last couple days

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,849
around mitigation and the potential

00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,279
concerns over consumption our focus is

00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,719
on creation now as the industry is

00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,699
looking to actually create and release

00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,319
its own open source software and the

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,210
benefits that knot brings not just for

00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,710
the product itself they're releasing but

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,870
the cultural and organizational change

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,430
that brings with it as well so becoming

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,349
an open source company having an open

00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,460
source product they're working with is

00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,810
actually changing the nature of the

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,210
company and that's the that's the

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,039
transformation will begin to see so I

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,319
went to a panel yesterday and all they

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,759
did he put present lots of slides you

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,560
couldn't read and there was no Thomson

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,560
Q&A so we can go straight to Q&A

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:24,929
[Music]

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:26,789
okay so okay yeah so actually no they do

00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:28,229
do we do do that type of consulting I

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,269
don't like to use the words management

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,129
consulting because actually one example

00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,479
with Opel global retail bank we were

00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:35,249
asked to do some work because we weren't

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,289
management consulting so they had

00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:39,479
management consultants in to advise them

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,489
about both inner sourcing and open

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,169
sourcing and how that could change the

00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:44,339
way they govern their software in

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,869
particularly they had one problem one

00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,419
piece of software which had been forked

00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,589
across 72 different countries and they

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,239
wanted to unify that using an

00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:53,039
open-source approach to bring that piece

00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:55,289
of software together they take a

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,969
management consulting advice and those

00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,639
will taken some system integrator advice

00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:01,800
but felt they had to go become digits to

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,819
keep it digitally native and people

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,009
actually knew what they're talking about

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,989
around open-source practice and so

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:08,429
that's what I think is there is a

00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,809
growing area and as you can see from the

00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,489
panel there's a growing area around what

00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,769
we might be seen as management

00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:15,629
consulting and open source but we tried

00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,849
to keep that differentiated because of

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,499
that because of what we're doing so the

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,240
open source practice that we have now is

00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,219
it's quite small all three of us are

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,050
here in the room right but we have other

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,269
groups in Red Hat - do we open source of

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,800
standards and other advisory groups but

00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,569
we're really thinking about in terms of

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,399
the way you can buy that service from

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,139
Red Hat is really been going for the

00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,869
last five years but we've kept it quite

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,550
focused on for example governance best

00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:40,469
practice we tend to separate so we do

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,509
government's documents for consumption

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,639
but our main focus now is helping people

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,739
become good community managers when they

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,300
release their software trying to break

00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:50,189
down some of the hurdles they have

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,139
internally over regulation and

00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:53,099
compliance and that sort of thing in

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,839
terms of way they released their

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,459
software so yes it is management

00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,349
consulting I don't like calling it

00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,969
management consulting because of some of

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:02,519
the connotations there that's just me

00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,929
personal that makes sense yeah so we do

00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,159
have some fixed offerings so we do have

00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,899
some very quick readiness we have

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,449
something called navigate which is a

00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,800
quick one month estimate so it over a

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,899
one of month elapse it's four or five

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,239
days on site we'll do a quick review of

00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,309
open source readiness in terms of

00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:19,139
consumption collaboration and creation

00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,399
so we'll do a quick review of what

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,749
they're doing across a part of the

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,839
organization and we'll try and measure

00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:26,460
the management appetit a petite versus

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,740
the individual contributor

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,479
appetite and ability and then say what

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,969
where are you in open source readiness

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,680
okay how ready are you and what you

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,750
might need so that's a fixed offering we

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,250
offer and then part for that it tends to

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,169
be a bit more bespoke let's don't beyond

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,550
that depending on the size we've put it

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,570
got three or four projects going on at

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:48,360
the moment and they're all quite

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,860
different in a way so let me add to that

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,570
a little bit I know your question was

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,339
particularly to Red Hat but but although

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,160
almost everyone on our team is an

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,459
engineer by vocation and we've we've all

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,580
written code the differentiation from

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:11,250
our point of view is strategy and

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:13,560
planning policy process planning versus

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,990
implementation so we don't have an army

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,029
of consultants that come in and actually

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:24,930
write the code into the implementation

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:26,700
for you we do the planning work so Greg

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,350
I'm gonna ask a question that that was

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,540
written on the face of one of our

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,310
attendees and I'll leave names out but

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,880
you listed a number of banks that you've

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,640
consulted with do you have you typically

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,529
consulted across the entire sort of

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,160
horizontally across the organization on

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:47,490
open source on open source practices or

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,829
do you and to find yourself hired by an

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:55,040
individual group or vertical or is there

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:55,040
is there is there a most common scenario

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,149
not just with financial services but in

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,820
general this depends upon the structure

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,709
and design of the organization so

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,320
sometimes some organizations are very

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:14,339
decentralized and so so each business

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,160
unit for instance in in a in a

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,320
diversified corporation may have great

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:26,430
independence with regard to their open

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:30,750
source it is slightly more common that

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:34,850
we will work for typically office of the

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:40,300
CTO or some other overall governing unit

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:43,510
around things like policy and process

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,770
or perhaps an inner source type of focus

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:49,390
to use the tools of open source to

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,510
facilitate code sharing within a company

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,370
those are usually done from a central

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,220
aspect if it's more about say a

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,190
particular product initiative or using

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,520
open source within a particular market

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,530
then it would more often be done with a

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:09,700
divisional perspective with one of the

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:12,460
groups responsible for that if I may add

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,560
to that what I see in my practice is it

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,540
tends to depend on how technical the

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,210
companies I work with are from the start

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,810
so basically the more technical they

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,610
already are

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,280
the more aware of these issues already

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,440
are the easier it is for me to work at

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,760
lower levels or was like specific

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,580
organizations or groups within the

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,470
company and when it's not well the

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,600
lesser they are the basically the higher

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,260
up you have to to go to explain the

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:43,180
benefits you do we have any questions

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:45,130
from the audience before ok I guess one

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,090
thing that I interested in your

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:52,270
perspective on is what what do you what

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,900
do your customers come to you with most

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,940
often saying that they want and are they

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,880
usually right that that's what they need

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,590
or do you find that there is some sort

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,480
of coaching on this is actually the

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,480
question that you're asking or should be

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,580
actually the recent questions been asked

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,860
vary a bit one of them is that we've got

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,140
this product and we want to open source

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,420
it and we think there's a benefit and so

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,590
we go through the why question why

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,240
should we open source it is there a

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,190
business justification for open sourcing

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,650
it and they either you wanted internal

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,060
support paper or Documenta or evidence

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,850
to support their open source business

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,930
case and we've that's we're working on a

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,430
couple of those at the moment and

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,080
they're quite interesting because what

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,480
they saw as clear cuts has become

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,470
slightly problematic and when you one of

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,640
the things we coming back to the

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,500
management consulting question it's

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,180
really interesting because actually one

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,320
of this thing tends to open is actually

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,570
the nature of the company you're working

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,550
for now is a bank a bank or an IT

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,290
company so when they start talking about

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,150
open sourcing software they're going to

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,350
create a community release they're going

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,889
to look into other people to use a

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,089
software

00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,769
therefore it might be an Enterprise

00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,239
version that release who's going to

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,069
provide the support maintenance and

00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,779
management for that Enterprise releases

00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,339
the open source software is it the

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,319
banker themselves or they can have to

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,939
find somebody else to do it so so

00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,829
there's lots of things that exposes in

00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:10,089
the nature of the wider discussion about

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,859
the nature of the business of the

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,589
organization you're talking to are you a

00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:16,569
bank are you an IT company so that's

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,559
really you get into the when you start

00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,850
talking about something open source

00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,019
who's paying for it

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,149
for example if you're talking to a

00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,679
government agency do tax payers want to

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,379
pay for software that's given away to

00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,790
somebody's not paying tax right for

00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,869
example is it government policy and

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,829
we've got one of those at the moment

00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:34,419
which is really the the Swiss paying

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,369
taxpayers and Switzerland want to fund

00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:38,799
software that might be used by Germans

00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,970
on a day to day basis right and so

00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,799
there's some political issues that

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,600
sometimes come into that as well so this

00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,519
is the why statement and then once the Y

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,839
is done it's the how the practicality

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,100
which were coming to Greg's point about

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,929
some of the technical side of the

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,569
implementation these guys know how to

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,919
code and some of their code is also one

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:56,230
of the other drivers for doing open

00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,699
sources their code is probably not open

00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,649
source Apple or even digitally

00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,540
transformed in any way so the open

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,569
sourcing is that a line to some form of

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,790
re refactoring redesign or rewrite of

00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:08,139
the code they're working on so you know

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,110
we've got one customers got seven

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,639
million lines of PL one and Java and

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,649
stuff as their code that they want to

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,389
open-source now it's not going to solve

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,769
the problem of them transform it because

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,739
nobody's going to contribute to a

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:22,089
project on that basis but they're going

00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,499
to start to Ma july's and do the design

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,160
and get people on board as they do the

00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,899
rewrite

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,459
so they've worked out the way they do

00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:31,419
that tooling so it's a different way of

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:34,149
thinking so yeah so it's the why the how

00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:35,709
and the doing it yes I think that's got

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,239
to be the organization or the community

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,249
that's created and we sort of seek

00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:41,980
helping people right being open source

00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:43,689
is more than the license okay and that's

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,319
that's all that mitigation and evidence

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,319
that comes from that

00:14:46,380 --> 00:15:26,980
[Music]

00:14:49,350 --> 00:15:29,350
yeah right right right right yeah so I

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,970
think you can't be I don't I would say

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,609
this right because good what do I work

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,100
but you can't do digital transformation

00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:37,269
without being open-source I don't think

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,589
because it's the cultural change in the

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,769
organization change that goes with it

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,089
and that cultural change Gareth and

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,279
Goldman this morning mentioned this idea

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,720
of this culture clash right of people of

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,419
what might happen and that culture clash

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,859
you see if I cam I'm not gonna I'm not

00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,480
gonna save mode 1 mode 2 I'm not going

00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,799
to give them credit forever the idea

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,779
that this change of old to the new

00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,980
that's also driven that's the open

00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,079
source way so it's more than just that

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,329
open source available I don't think I

00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,739
think the only way you can do digital

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,179
transformation is partly change the

00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:05,739
tooling but changing the mindset in the

00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,360
way of working and you have to be open

00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:09,459
source you can't have all these hurdles

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
in the way for commits and changes

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:13,799
because you just won't be working quick

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,799
enough for changing the way you work

00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:23,319
well yeah I think that this idea that

00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,679
open source and contributing to open

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,549
source and having an open source culture

00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,009
works together with digital

00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:31,839
transformation is critical and I think

00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,339
actually that a lot of companies today

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,009
that are at the beginning of that

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,899
digital transformation are in an

00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,679
interesting position where they can sort

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:45,100
of leapfrog a lot of the technology that

00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:48,910
the existing tech companies have and

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:53,279
directly go into to be directly

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:56,489
open-source so really avoid this whole

00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:01,079
past way of doing things in tech and

00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:02,949
yeah just move ahead with the idea of

00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,880
opensource going hand-in-hand with

00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:08,860
digital transformation back to your

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,780
original question is is what's what

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:16,720
starts a call for help at an

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,980
organization and it's usually some

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,770
particular point of pain or awareness of

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,589
miss opportunities somebody realizes

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:30,909
that something is important to change

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:33,870
now this this can be more appointed pain

00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:36,669
like for instance an audit that says oh

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,799
we're using all this code from outside

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,650
the company we don't know what it is or

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,679
where it's being used and there are

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:48,700
security vulnerabilities appearing in it

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,100
right well that's right and in other

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,549
words so so you know it's the out of the

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:58,450
out of control alarm often often

00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,549
instigates some work to understand how

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,500
the company is using open source and to

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:08,080
understand best practices for managing

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:13,900
it efficiently and another one is cost

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:17,679
savings the which is is really oriented

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,440
to legacy replacement theory that we can

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,740
we can use open source instead of this

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,539
very very expensive proprietary software

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,539
that we've been stuck with for the last

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:33,010
15 years and and there's there's a good

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:34,929
basis for that and but you can't do that

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,419
unless you've got an infrastructure for

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,640
intelligently using open source and

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,250
managing it and so that's been another

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:48,130
another driver another one it's

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:51,270
interesting is is being able to share

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,890
software or interoperate between

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,289
different divisions of a large

00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:01,020
organization and so if everybody's got

00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:04,870
their own custom or proprietary software

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,820
infrastructure it makes it very hard to

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,340
tie divisions for any kind of business

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,309
synergy and so sometimes it comes out of

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,770
a need to to integrate the business and

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,200
and and and realize some advantage

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,540
across the scope of your business

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,270
divisions and finding some common

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,120
software that allows that to happen that

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,280
that often will instigate interest and

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,740
and an imperative to use open source

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,300
software so those are three examples at

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,370
least um yeah just to two quick examples

00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,790
of that one of the things so I work

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,950
mostly with tech companies and I sort of

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:46,270
tend to see two kinds of reasons

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,850
companies come to me the first the first

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,490
one is smaller companies that envision

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,960
the software that they want to sell and

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,570
wonder if they can actually have an

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,940
open-source business model around it so

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,670
that's a common one probably not going

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,940
to speak much to a financial sector

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:07,660
maybe to FinTech to some extent the

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,580
other one is more round I'm gonna say

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,490
community management but more how

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:15,820
reception by the community you know and

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:19,840
so find the right tone find the right

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,370
tactics to make a project successful an

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,080
open source project successful in the

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:28,840
what in the outside world ok so if if

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,720
all financial services firms think they

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,450
need to become technology companies what

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,580
is what is the difference that you've

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,860
seen between working for a technology

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,160
company and working for a bank what are

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,200
the particular challenges working for a

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:51,310
financial services institution and what

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:52,900
if anything is easier quite quick

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,020
actually I think I'm not convinced that

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,040
the premise that all banks or financial

00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,540
services companies see themselves as

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,950
tech companies I think that so well I've

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,840
had conversations where they feel that

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,490
they've gone too far actually and they

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,760
need to step back and they're going to

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,500
look at that so yes they want they need

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,910
to be technology savvy a bit but will

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,990
they do are they going to be a bank are

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,940
they gonna be an IT company they're

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,850
gonna be more technology focused for

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,650
sure but the the problem they have is

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,630
that still they're still saying no no

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,400
our core business is still making money

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,830
from banks had a conversation here last

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,060
night where with somebody where they're

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,390
saying if they're making as much money

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,910
for the

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,820
IT services they now sell internally and

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,800
to third parties using their product and

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,390
platform which is an open source than

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,260
they are making from actually using the

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:49,780
technology to make money

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:51,580
yeah but not I mean yeah right well in

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,470
this case it's it was an interesting

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,760
conversation so the point is and and

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,380
that will we'll have a follow-up

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,580
conversation with them it's which way

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,010
they're gonna which way they think and

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:03,430
he cut pretty simply is the is the seed

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,260
CIO of a CTO in fact the CEO or not

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,520
right and that's that we got fact level

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,590
of conversation are there it's out the

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,600
person who's driving policy is IT now

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,950
driving policy in terms of products and

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,050
offerings and the position of the

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,070
business and yeah we've and that's the

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,210
weird thing about some of the open

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,740
source stuff that we're doing which

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,320
isn't management consulting it is

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,910
getting down to that level of

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,910
conversation which is it for right at

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,370
this well thirty four billion dollar

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,040
company whatever you want to call it you

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,480
know it this small company you know of

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,920
you know if ten thousand people or

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,140
whatever which is a tech companies to

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,820
have that level of conversation he's all

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,500
been driven by open-source it just shows

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,940
that open-source is important in that

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,470
strategy as well because we're now

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,480
having those conversations and we

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,860
actually make to some extent and you

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,990
know surprise surprise you're making

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,090
slightly a fairly valuable contribution

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,560
to it which is quite surprising because

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,820
it's not just purely a tactical play so

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,940
that's the interesting about the open

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,100
source conversation so that that's

00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,960
that's it so yes top-down but that must

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,550
mean that they are becoming a technology

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,290
company to have that conversation

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:09,190
because I I don't know much about

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:13,390
banking I have to agree that this is a

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:16,090
bit of a a it's a good slogan but but

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,220
but you know the reality is that that

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:22,780
your business is about delivering some

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,480
kind of value to a market in return for

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,020
profits right and a tech company is

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,700
selling technology there's a product or

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,830
now as a subscription service or

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,620
whatever but but basically the value

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,990
proposition is technology that does some

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,320
technical thing better and banks in

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,389
general are providing financial services

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,909
we

00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:47,539
which are largely a different value

00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:50,119
proposition so it is important though to

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,029
know what your value proposition is in

00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,209
any business in order to in order to

00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:58,519
hone that successfully there is a big

00:23:56,209 --> 00:24:01,070
difference in terms of our tech clients

00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,399
and and financial services clients I

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,899
mean the the the tech sector has been

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:10,999
involved with open source for much

00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:15,859
longer you know when when when I started

00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:18,409
as a consultant it was actually the

00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:19,789
mid-90s I founded a company based on

00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:21,979
open source software our well known

00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:24,709
project and had to sort out some of the

00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:28,209
business models around free software how

00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:30,950
do you make money from free software but

00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:35,829
it's really been active since the mid

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:38,959
90s in the tech sector as as a

00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:42,349
phenomenon and a major theme around

00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:45,799
software development and and delivering

00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:47,389
technology value to customers and so the

00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,690
you know the level of experience and

00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:53,509
sophistication is much higher in the in

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:58,249
the tech sectors of course and in

00:24:53,509 --> 00:25:00,559
sectors where the technology is it's

00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:04,849
part of the delivery mechanism it's

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:10,070
slower so Manufacturing's and a symbol

00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:12,950
in a similar sort of situation as as

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,659
financial services in that way on the

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,820
other hand you know one of the things

00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:19,609
that that has most strongly driven

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,619
open-source is that when you have

00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:24,469
software that needs to talk to other

00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:26,629
software being able to look at the code

00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:28,999
on both sides of that conversation is a

00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:31,099
huge advantage right well that's why the

00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:33,469
internet was built on open source but

00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:35,479
today almost all software has to talk to

00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:37,450
other software and so we're seeing that

00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:41,389
open source has this compelling

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,489
advantage in all kinds of systems as a

00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:46,909
result and so anybody that's

00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:48,709
implementing technology systems that are

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,440
networked and talk to other other

00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:54,330
systems and other applications are

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,590
finding open source to be a

00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:00,029
a compelling need in their business I

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,169
might actually disagree with the need

00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:03,059
open-source and one thing we've seen

00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,830
recently is that actually when we're

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,419
talking to financial services companies

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,669
their product that they're offering is

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,080
further up the stack so the further down

00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,120
the technology stack the more

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,370
general-purpose it might be the more

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,440
reuse and more common interest among

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,179
other companies would be so we've had

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,519
financial services company with fairly

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,710
niche product let's say we're insurance

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,120
underwriting software for example now

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,409
there's no off-the-shelf product funny

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,269
enough in the insurance industry that

00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:29,399
covers that there's bits and pieces and

00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,570
tolling so is there a business benefit

00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:32,190
to try and release something which is

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,260
always gonna have a limited or get oh

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,700
you know interest you've got to have

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,260
over you've got have you know got to be

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,179
a fairly large insurance company with a

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,159
big underwriting portfolio is there

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,690
really benefit in open sure thing when

00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,370
you've got only a you've got no

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,919
individual contributor interest you've

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,330
only got commercial interest is there

00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,860
really interested so you know and this

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,480
is a big debate I guess finish as well

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,130
because we're talking to a this

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,480
corporate discussion it's very different

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,309
we're open source started with

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,070
individual contributors scratching an

00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:01,740
itch of the masses sitting in bedrooms

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,899
and small offices and sheds in Santiago

00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,429
Chile around the world right we're now

00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:06,750
we're talking about sharing between big

00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:09,480
corporates and this other thing has

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,549
changed so the bid the benefit of open

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,929
sourcing between something up the stack

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,659
at the top of the stack which might have

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,580
a specific point against another like

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,769
two insurance companies sharing their

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,210
thing to share code there are I think

00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:23,460
there are dummy wrong I think they are

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,139
but it's not so clear-cut about that

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,289
benefit of being open source and that

00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,289
collaboration

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,889
right so one area for us interesting and

00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:40,090
I don't know Financial Services is great

00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:43,269
really interesting but I'm also quite

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,009
interested in trains ok like all people

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:47,860
of my generation and actually things

00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,899
like a train transport is it's quite

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,590
interesting because of things like

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:54,970
shared services shared interaction with

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,159
Hardware air traffic controllers good

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,869
example as well of where you could see

00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,940
open-source benefits to drive open

00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:09,399
standards and therefore the relationship

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:10,450
with the vendors Toby good enjoy but so

00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,549
yeah in financial service there are

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,710
areas I think and that the models we're

00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,240
beginning to see are not so clear-cut

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,070
but they are interesting and I think

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,899
they make sense for open-source but for

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,970
different reasons maybe then you might

00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:24,519
have open source the web server or a web

00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,019
engine in the past which is a generic

00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,580
tool something like the underwriting

00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:29,379
software there be different motivations

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,029
are open sourcing it so the why question

00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:33,159
is different and the business question

00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,240
is different and actually there's

00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,340
usually a commercial model they're

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,899
trying to achieve so actually the type

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,440
of commercial open source model you

00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:42,490
might have and our Toby was talking

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,619
about his work with the tech companies

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,119
an awful lot of open core models in

00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:48,429
start-up and tech companies which

00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,169
actually I don't think would work in a

00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,429
financial services organization there'd

00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,169
be no benefit for them doing that if

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,429
they're not pure primarily looking to

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:59,830
generate revenue from the software

00:28:54,429 --> 00:29:02,350
itself because they're still a bank yeah

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:05,919
it's true not everything should be going

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,690
to open-source yesterday you know when I

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,820
talked about approaches for

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,570
mission-critical open source I talked

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,190
about differentiation analysis so you're

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,649
gonna have some things in your value in

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,869
your in your portfolio software

00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:21,100
portfolio that provide unique value and

00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:24,429
you don't want to give them all away

00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:28,330
right the thing the thing is there are

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:31,179
there are also components that are less

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,940
expensive to maintain for your company

00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:36,039
if they're shares resources and those

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,110
are the ones that are good candidates so

00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,210
they do tend to be the underpinnings

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,220
right as opposed to the higher-level

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,899
application value I mean certainly you

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,150
know nobody else is going to be

00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:47,230
interested in your particular

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,110
particularly user interface to your

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,720
customers to paint a really extreme

00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,460
examples so it is important as the

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,550
company develops its strategy and

00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:01,720
approach to open-source to to have in

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,970
that model for managing it an explicit

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,220
way to decide which things are

00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:09,100
proprietary value and you need to keep

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:12,520
and which things you'll save money from

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:38,560
if you use them in a shared capacity of

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:41,350
open source so to repeat for the camera

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,580
the question is companies are often not

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,280
quite ready to hear the advice that

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,810
they're that they're asking for what can

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,420
they do to better prepare themselves to

00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,800
to be ready to take a minute that's a

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,240
really good point the Red Hat has

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,640
provided a lot of advice

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,020
and usually come back off exec meetings

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,060
or top-level exact meetings with

00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,610
organizations and the one reason we have

00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,080
the this open source practice now is

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,180
because we've tried to put that onto a

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,830
partly on a billable footing they tend

00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,300
to listen more when they're paying if

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,370
that's a simple thing I know it sounds

00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,590
silly but it's actually true of what we

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,510
do across the board so the other thing

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,920
we have this readiness assessment so we

00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,200
have this open source maturity

00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,230
assessment model this navigate offering

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,090
we can do very quickly but we need think

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,410
it needs it's got a prerequisite we've

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,790
got a list of people we'd like to speak

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,380
to we've got a series of workshops

00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,120
it's predefined that we don't use it

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,250
just for open source we use it some of

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,470
our digital transformation container

00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:35,380
adoption journey stuff as well so that's

00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,760
a good start for us and we actually use

00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,710
a number of tools to try and assess that

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,400
organization in a number of ways at

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,840
ramped people around well about

00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,010
stakeholders opportunities and we try

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,530
and measure that as we go forward so

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,970
we're trying to be to say actually and

00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,890
be very upfront if we don't think we're

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,720
getting the information for example open

00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,950
sourcing stuff some time I've been to

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,500
meetings talk about open sourcing

00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,120
software when actually the people of

00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,930
write software might be third party

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,220
there might be outsourced

00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,170
there might be outsource they're not

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,640
even in the room right so actually you

00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,480
can't get the answers to the questions

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,580
you're trying to ask about the

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,170
technology so you know you've got to try

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:13,420
and answer those upfront there there are

00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:16,540
a lot of resources about open source out

00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,250
there the Linux Foundation for instance

00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,960
everyone has a number of resources about

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,720
how open source works and how to

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,600
participate in open source but you know

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,880
from our experience when a client comes

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,140
to us with a problem a business problem

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,610
they need to be salt needs to be solved

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:37,030
we have to work with them in the state

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:39,130
that they're in and so we also have an

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:45,070
open source management assessment tool

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:47,650
that that measures all the dimensions of

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,510
a company's use of open source to

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,820
understand we know what's what's

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,340
well-managed to what isn't well-managed

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:57,310
what's inconsistently managed across the

00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,780
different groups and and that gives us a

00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,420
picture of the starting point and

00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,340
inevitably whether we're doing a

00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,740
business strategy or whether we're doing

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,710
an open source policy it starts with

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,740
training so that everyone's on the same

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,150
page all you gather all the stakeholders

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,940
together and we get to a common

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:18,850
understanding about the principles of

00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,340
either gaining business advantage from

00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,870
open source in the in the focus context

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:27,580
that's a that's appropriate to the

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:31,690
situation or in terms of managing open

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:34,210
source in a company such as such as

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,100
yours and that varies incidentally

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,810
between tech companies that sell

00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,610
technology and companies that use

00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:42,760
technology to deliver some other

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:45,880
business value but it has to start with

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,890
training the other thing I'd say that's

00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,140
not directly related to this question

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,120
but in a lot of cases the highest value

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:56,800
that we've brought to our clients is to

00:33:52,120 --> 00:34:00,820
be able to facilitate the creation of

00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,340
consensus about the approach and this is

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,650
true both in strategy but in policy

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,990
there's there's dozens of decisions that

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,600
that tend to be controversial within

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,550
organizations and our ability through a

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,550
combination of Education and

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,620
the ability to talk about you because

00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,980
we've worked with hundreds of clients we

00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,710
can we can talk about well if you do

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,660
this this is what's going to happen

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:29,260
you'll see this and and using that sort

00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:31,390
of technique we're able to drive

00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,320
consensus in the organization about how

00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:37,179
to do things and that's that's key

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,640
because you can get a policy written but

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:43,270
if it isn't agreed it probably won't get

00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,370
followed for instance so one second Greg

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,410
Greg mentioned resources and I and I

00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,690
just wanted to insert a little plug for

00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:52,810
a resource that we actually published

00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:55,990
concurrently with the conference we

00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:58,960
meaning finis put together a white paper

00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:02,430
with red hat Thank You Leslie Hawthorne

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,620
for co-writing it with us as well as our

00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:08,350
panelists in absentia and rakin from

00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,610
Wipro there it is the benefits and

00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,020
business value of open-source it's

00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,500
intended to be a sort of an executive

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,610
level discussion of the of the benefits

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,610
that you'll get from open-source that

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,230
you can take to your to your management

00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:25,450
NIT and in business to help explain

00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,490
without getting to in the weeds what

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,310
what the benefits they'll see is art

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:33,070
rather and since you both mentioned that

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,560
you each have assessments of open-source

00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:37,690
readiness and since we are working on

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,070
one of those ourselves I will say

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,530
without putting either of you on the

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,810
spot maybe let's work together to to

00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,330
unify those efforts Oh wonderful all

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,930
right put me on the spot okay yeah we

00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,930
have another question

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,710
[Music]

00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:21,980
so the question is is the movement in

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:25,190
financial services to public cloud

00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:28,430
having any effect on and and containers

00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:33,650
having an effect on on movements toward

00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:35,750
open source as well I think sorry I

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,000
think I think we're having discussions

00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,380
with people who are struggling with that

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,150
digital transformation and move to

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,230
contain a platform or cloud and as part

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,580
of that discussion as I mentioned

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,440
earlier they're having to change the

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,240
culture and the way they work of what

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,830
they're doing so actually abducting open

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,900
source not to make the product open

00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,880
source but the working methods to react

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,890
and develop in the right way is the key

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,590
thing so that's why I think we're having

00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,880
a renewed level of interest we're

00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,580
building a lot of container platforms

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,980
for heedful for people and then we're

00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,560
watching them move workloads onto public

00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,170
cloud or on to on-premise container

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,610
platform and they're they're having to

00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,500
look not just at the code and the

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,880
rewrite or the replac forming but also

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,440
the way that that's worked and they're

00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,480
looking at the open source way of

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,550
working to do it so I think absolutely

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,800
as I said to make that to be the most

00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:27,740
effective way of doing it is to take on

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:31,990
an open source approach of doing it in

00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:34,520
general that these trends have

00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,740
facilitated open source I mean first of

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,680
all anyone creating software the

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:43,570
availability of compute resources from

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:48,440
small to large configured and online in

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:50,810
ten minutes in the cloud facilitates

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,750
development and and that the other thing

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:57,550
is has opened up a lot in terms of

00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,810
interoperability because on the cloud

00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,220
writing applications that talk to other

00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:06,080
applications is

00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:07,940
easier and quicker and so and that's

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,859
related to open source again if you know

00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,830
what the code is on both ends it's much

00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,330
easier to do that so that that's

00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,980
increased the value that open source

00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:18,260
delivers in the market and then there's

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,550
whole new areas of code that have come

00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,099
out of this particularly I mean think

00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,590
about a cloud orchestration right this

00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:27,440
whole area of software that creates and

00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:30,590
manages these cloud environments these

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,840
are all being done an open source by

00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,180
broad groups because you know this is

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,450
common infrastructure everyone needs it

00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,599
it it it's most economical and effective

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,950
to develop it as a shared resource and

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,890
so if you look at things like cloud

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:49,070
foundry and and kubernetes for instance

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,800
and even on the telephony side I realize

00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:54,050
this is another industry but the the

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,500
next-generation telephony networks are

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,990
all clouds and containers and it's got a

00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:03,410
specific telephony oriented

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:06,230
orchestration level as well so all of

00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:09,320
these new whole new industries if you

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,720
will are be create being created in open

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,410
source software because of the nature of

00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,740
the cloud so our time is technically up

00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:22,190
however the next thing on the agenda is

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:25,369
the ten minute break before lunch so if

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,080
you if anyone wants to get up and leave

00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:28,490
to take advantage of that break no one

00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,869
will think you rude but I think that

00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,880
there's enough interest here that it

00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:35,000
makes sense for and nobody's waiting for

00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,070
the room I make sense to keep going if

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,040
our panelists are up for it for another

00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:55,910
ten minutes okay all right great yeah

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:58,550
another questions back there so if

00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,710
someone's looking to open source some

00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,720
software where the actual differentiator

00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,130
for their product is their data what

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:16,250
conversations do you have with your

00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:18,770
customers around that yeah open source

00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:22,609
and open data are are very much

00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:25,640
different domains certainly and and to

00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:30,470
be honest with the open source is much

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:32,810
more mature in our society I think that

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,599
we've got a huge problem about data and

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,210
control of the data and all the way down

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,369
to the level of personal data and

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:44,119
ownership and who gets capitalize on it

00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:48,230
and as a society we are not mature and

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:50,750
figuring out how how what are even the

00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:54,020
concepts for managing this much less the

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:58,160
the technical mechanisms for doing that

00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:02,359
in terms of bits of implementation but

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:07,430
also in laws that specify what those

00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:11,060
dimensions for management are so very

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:14,330
often in the open source world with say

00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:17,330
companies building things that they

00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,940
open-source the code but the values in

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,950
the data usually that the data is

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,390
reserved is there proprietary interest

00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,089
and that's the thing that they can get

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:30,230
subscriptions for right and so it's it's

00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:32,720
actually critical to the data model in

00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:35,000
in many of those cases it's it's one of

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,400
the it's actually one of the open source

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,270
business models that let you make money

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,180
on free software so how does that belong

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,280
well it it I don't think you want to say

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,230
that's bad or it doesn't work because in

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,180
fact in those cases typically the

00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,250
maintenance of the data is a very

00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,440
expensive process and that's why it has

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,710
so much value so somebody's got to pay

00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,710
for it

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,829
yeah I think it's an interesting one

00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,069
actually a good point

00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:16,599
and we've done some work on theirs

00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:18,609
haven't done much around data itself and

00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,989
for example we did some discussion in in

00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:21,670
South Africa they've done some stuff

00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:24,009
around the Debbie check stuff so for

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,420
direct debit authorization some of those

00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:27,190
implementations have been done

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,509
unfortunately not pure open-source

00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,309
implementation but a lot of talk about

00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:32,769
that data because that common data pool

00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:34,779
for debit check there's massive debit

00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:36,549
fraud and/or prevention stuff and it's

00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:38,230
actually quite and we had a you know

00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:39,819
we've managed to get four of the main

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,809
players in a room to talk about it and

00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:42,460
talk about that data and that

00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,259
interaction but unfortunately haven't

00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,759
done as much as I'd like in that area

00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:47,829
I'd love to be more around open source

00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:50,289
stuff we did some of the Arts Council of

00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:52,480
England once about open sourcing art and

00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:54,309
this is years ago Richard Stallman spoke

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,809
at the event and actually made them the

00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:57,700
event made the papers the following day

00:42:55,809 --> 00:43:00,009
because he actually brained mad cow

00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,859
disease on proprietary software in May

00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:04,359
so so he actually we actually did the

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:06,789
event was meant to be talked about art

00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:08,619
and pictures but he but it was great so

00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:11,109
he actually we did make the sort of page

00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:13,210
two at the Telegraph as a result if it's

00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:14,920
common it was absolutely spot-on so in a

00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,410
way I'd like to do I'd like to do more

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,309
stuff around that sort of area and

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,749
there's a lot actually if you look at

00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:21,849
recent there's a lot of renewed interest

00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:23,019
of data especially for journalism that

00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,970
you've already seen to some of these

00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:27,249
open source investigations where they've

00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,329
proved some Cameroonian soldier cases

00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:30,759
the one that's kicking around with the

00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:32,980
death of some guys in Cameroon and they

00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:35,680
used the evidence and open-source data

00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,210
like Google's Google Earth data and

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,819
everything else to actually work out the

00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:41,259
location they used other information

00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:42,609
from passport control to work out who

00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:48,099
the perpetrators might be and other

00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:50,559
things like that so yeah yeah correct

00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:51,489
yeah you got it and so I think that's a

00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,980
really interesting area because

00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:55,690
obviously and of course the adage could

00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,160
be and we've always said to have an open

00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,839
standard you could have open source and

00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,609
to have an to have be open source a fair

00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:03,249
an open standard you could argue that my

00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:04,960
also now put data in that in that mix as

00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:05,920
well and of course if anybody's

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,150
releasing and we have kind of

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,519
conversation this morning and you know

00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,670
about you need a good data set if you've

00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,470
got a bit of open source safe

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,210
software need a good data set to

00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,200
validate their software the rule is if

00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,700
you have a project and we have a

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,319
conversation with a financial services

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,880
company we're going to release this out

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,380
to the industry I said well if people

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,240
can't go to github and get it working in

00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,859
an hour you failed and they have to have

00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,990
it working with meaningful data that

00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:29,480
print generates pretty pictures so you

00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:32,000
can have to also open source or put in

00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,230
there a set of data to make that work so

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,150
people get the full function

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,970
understanding you can't say all you need

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,529
to go now find a thousand data sets to

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,549
chuck in there you're gonna have to give

00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:53,869
them to them so they've got a full

00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:54,799
functional thing in an hour so yeah

00:44:53,869 --> 00:45:03,950
that's an interesting point about the

00:44:54,799 --> 00:45:06,369
api's yeah it's nearly there so real

00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:09,920
quickly or I'll try and make it quick

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:12,319
depending on the project when someone is

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,650
thinking of hiring a consultant they

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,240
might also be thinking about hiring

00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:21,400
someone to their staff they might be

00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:24,950
thinking about hiring a lawyer or hiring

00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:29,829
I don't know they're there there any

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:33,079
number of ways to sort of approach a a

00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:37,609
desire to engage more deeply in open

00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:41,569
source why when should those in the room

00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:43,490
be thinking about hiring you over any

00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:45,940
anyone else any other resource they

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:49,759
might want to take on for the job and

00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:54,980
why specifically your consultancy versus

00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:59,740
say you know Deloitte or whoever else in

00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,740
the world please

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,830
[Music]

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,480
regardless of whom you hire it is so

00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,880
much easier to get through the process

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,860
if you bring in help as early as

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,750
possible because people tend to get very

00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,000
fixated on the ideas that they have

00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:25,830
about what their strategy should be and

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,720
if they're not going to go well

00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,670
just waiting them of those ideas later

00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,250
is much more difficult so getting input

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,050
early and often is I will just say it's

00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:40,770
crucial to success and in that case I

00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:43,920
did not succeed yeah my my experience is

00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:46,190
that to be successful you need in in

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,110
many cases both outside help and

00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,850
somebody inside that's going that it's

00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,460
it's going to be knowledgeable and drive

00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:56,370
this forward the value of the outside

00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,880
help in general is the much much broader

00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:02,250
experience so it's very hard to hire

00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,100
somebody that's done this a hundred

00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:08,580
times before with other companies in

00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:10,170
other contexts and knows all of the if

00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:14,220
you do this this is what's going to

00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:16,590
happen reality around open source it's

00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,720
complicated there are a lot of different

00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:20,130
configurations for using open source a

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,660
lot of different models a lot of

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:27,810
decisions and so you know the idea of

00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,550
creating for instance perhaps this is

00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:32,040
easier to talk about in the context of

00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:34,710
say an open source policy for using and

00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,910
contributing that has to be shaped to

00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:40,890
the needs of your business so you need

00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:45,180
both internal and external and you need

00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:48,150
continuity of Understanding to drive

00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,160
that forward into implementation and

00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:53,010
through operation for the next period so

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,740
it really it the best strategy is to

00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:57,780
bring in outside help so you can get the

00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:02,550
broadest possible experience into your

00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:04,860
decisions but at the at the initial part

00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:07,680
have an inside resource that's ready to

00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:11,910
absorb that understand it and drive it

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,260
forward within the organization another

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,600
when I went onto the

00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,310
point about the the which Gregg has just

00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,770
touched on but quickly you mentioned

00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:22,320
about whether the management consulting

00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:24,030
z' and the system integrator GS eyes and

00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,370
bits are investing in there they are

00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:28,410
Andrews not here but obviously he works

00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,030
with pro so they have an open-source

00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,440
policy unit and stuff within where pro

00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,600
we're aware that some of the other

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,160
larger organizations and consulting

00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,380
companies are doing that I think the

00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,700
differentiator from from a red hat point

00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,320
of view and while it's not going to be

00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,940
core business it's never going to be the

00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,560
main part of what we do or even a large

00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,690
part but we are digitally native we're

00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,010
closer to the the way of working and got

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,050
a business model which is pure

00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,490
open-source so that's the experience

00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,280
that we would bring which you wouldn't

00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,720
necessarily get internally or somewhere

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,150
else so that's what we're trying to

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,220
leverage as a group is take the way for

00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:01,770
example the threads we see internally

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,600
between engineers about how for example

00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,400
loads of stuff around about approval

00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,990
before you commit upstream as a big

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,690
thread this week internally RedHat this

00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,860
about approvals and bits and pieces

00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:12,480
along with the usual other loads of

00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,040
threads but that experience and that

00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,660
feedback from developers of how they're

00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,110
thinking and what they see is the

00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,670
berries

00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:19,410
is really useful for when I go on site

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,900
and talk to people having the same

00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,730
challenges so we're really taking I'm

00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,650
really it's it's like selling your own

00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:28,890
you know sort of what you're doing

00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:30,420
internally it's it's like you know at

00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,380
home with you know The Osbournes and

00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,110
stuff isn't it you know you're actually

00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,290
it's like it's some sort of sort of a

00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:38,580
reality show where you know you actually

00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,230
inviting RedHat to come in and talk

00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,970
about you know show you how you do it in

00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:44,010
the organization and that's it

00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:46,440
successful business model so yeah if

00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,660
we're blatantly basing it on that so for

00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,860
me that's it's actually good fun and

00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,120
it's quite it's relatively

00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,160
straightforward because we've always got

00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,180
examples and we've always got that a lot

00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,190
of the what we're doing the moment is

00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,080
actually where we have internal sponsors

00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,660
and internal teams now coming to us for

00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,040
ratification and justification for

00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,750
senior management for further investment

00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,190
that's a lot of projects we have on that

00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,360
base as the moment and that's that's

00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,360
really good to do to support that

00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:16,930
so they throw on an independent or

00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,950
third-party voice so I agree that yes

00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,640
like anything when you pay for

00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,109
consulting it

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,299
carries a bit more weight I think in our

00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:23,499
cases that you've gone outside to check

00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:25,269
it it could be with us could be with

00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,079
Greg it could be with somebody else but

00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,670
they're coming to say especially

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,490
otherwise thinking why did you open

00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:33,430
source so why should we open source yeah

00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:37,299
the one thing I forgot to mention is is

00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:39,730
very often an outsider a consultant can

00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:41,740
help drive consensus in a way that

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,109
somebody you hire into one piece of the

00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,890
organization can't you know some new guy

00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:50,200
over in this department doesn't have the

00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,789
same ability to walk in as an expert and

00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,019
talk to the corporate counsel or the

00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:58,960
executive of multiple divisions and sort

00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:02,069
of corral the opinions towards a

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,539
consensus yeah yeah exactly

00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:07,720
I'm the guy who's usually standing in

00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:09,249
the backroom going so I was like thank

00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,349
you - Malcolm Herbert in - Greg Olson

00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:12,750
and please join me in thanking them and

00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:14,850
enjoy your lunch

00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:18,520
[Applause]
