Presentation: Getting the most out of Open Source in a Regulated Industry

Leading Fintech companies are bullish on Open Source, but most of them still don’t know how to get involved in ways that harmonize with the Regulatory climate of the Financial Services industry. In this talk you’ll learn how to maintain Security within transparently developed software assets and how to teach your internal developers to collaborate safely and sanely? You’ll hear about the best pathways to building an Open Source program at your Fintech company without costly mistakes that can reflect badly on your brand. Lastly you’ll learn about a community of practice that is perfectly suited to the needs of Fintech companies looking to get started in Open Source.

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,080
okay

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,850
hi I am my name is Denise Cooper I'm an

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,460
opensource activist I've been around

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,810
about 20 years so lots and lots of

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,830
people have been coming up to me here to

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,779
say that they've heard me speak before

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,990
and I apologize for that

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,669
I wrote this presentation yesterday and

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,460
sent it off to my new company and they

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,380
applied branding so I'll be some

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,510
branding on this that hasn't happened

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,210
before but they're lovely people and so

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,430
they deserve some branding and I am

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,160
gonna talk to you from my four and a

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,899
half years of working at PayPal and

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,600
looking at and and my 20 years of

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,070
consulting in the open source space

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,140
looking at how you can get around some

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,789
of the regulatory stuff or what some

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,590
companies have done and I'm gonna

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,910
describe a thing that we've been working

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,739
on that might be useful so here we go

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,470
first of all I want to say that open

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,260
source is both great and good it is both

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,790
things right but it's also got the

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,740
problem of being kind of a dessert

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,280
topping and a floor wax at the same time

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,229
so people don't know that are just

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,500
coming to it aren't quite sure where

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,689
they land in the continuum of you know

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,759
how to be part of it and my experience

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,880
is everything that's happening that I've

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,530
heard in the last day and a half is

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,040
exactly what we were worried about 18

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,799
years ago and what's interesting is a

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,290
lot of our worries have evaporated so in

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,360
the straight tech world we used to have

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,729
compliance like crazy we used to run

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,409
every single commit external comment

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,860
through some rigorous process we should

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,350
do all that stuff because we were afraid

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,670
but all of those licenses that we were

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,479
dealing with then trigger on

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,280
distribution and that isn't such a

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,710
problem now we'll talk about that in a

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,399
minute so these days when I go into a

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,459
new company even even PayPal I expected

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,530
that it was going to be exactly what was

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,400
described by Goldman Sachs you know lots

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,250
of process around releasing stuff in

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,200
the public in a controlled way and what

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,260
is what I found was they were already

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,970
past it they didn't care anymore except

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,900
for the AGPL but we'll talk about that

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,730
when we get to it all right so we have

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,109
to acknowledge that you know banking

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,790
FinTech generally is a regulated

00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:34,010
industry and if you look if you think

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,290
about why those regulations exist how

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,920
you became a regulated industry it's

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,430
because people's money matters and you

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,040
can't screw with people's money you know

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,750
that's why years ago Google tried to do

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,849
try to become a bank or at least a

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,609
payment processor and it failed because

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:56,239
their whole thing is around self-service

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:57,799
and asynchronous communication and

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,200
people want to be able to call somebody

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:01,670
about their money and they just were

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,470
never going to go there so you know it

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,269
failed for them I think Apple pay will

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,859
probably work better because Apple

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,650
understands customer service or at least

00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:12,889
what the consumer wants in terms of

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,840
connection so so you got to deal with

00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:16,879
regulations and as a result of the

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,799
regulations I'm observing that most of

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,599
the companies that are in the FinTech

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,629
space that are just entering the market

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,650
are kind of taking the long way right

00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:30,169
there on a serious detour path because

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,669
it seems too scary it seems daunting but

00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,440
I promise you guys are getting wrap your

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,629
heads around it whoever figures it out

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,579
first and gets the advantage of that is

00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,340
gonna is gonna lead the way for

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,199
everybody else and actually technically

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,569
in the past Fanta

00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,280
was the leader I know how many of you

00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:50,620
guys know that Morgan Stanley was the

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,819
first company to build one you x86-based

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,669
supercomputer and kicked their sun

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,440
stations out because of the existence of

00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,479
Linux that was Morgan Stanley that did

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,739
that and they told us that everybody

00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,449
else in the financial services industry

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:06,440
would be following suit and you got

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,760
y'all did right so it's not that foreign

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,919
a concept it's really just the

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,129
contribute contribution back that's hard

00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,319
and you let us do it you know you would

00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,570
back a company like you choose Red Hat

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,880
or you choose su se or you choose a

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,590
version of Linux that was already

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,789
contributing for you if you know what

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,229
I'm saying you paid them money and

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,180
they're that supported their

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,260
contributions so you couldn't think of

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,120
yourselves as concur

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,710
tribute errs already does anybody know

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,360
what this is that is a black duck I'm

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,860
going to be bashing black duck a couple

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,840
of times in the foot course of this

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,540
conversation and not just black duck

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,340
it's just that the name is so iconic

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,460
Palomita I had I don't know much about

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,370
white source but my problem with these

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,350
companies is not that they don't that

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,150
they provide a service I think it's an

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,160
interesting service to scan code and

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,630
learn everything you can about what's

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,290
going on in the code base

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,840
however they sell by by peddling fear

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,790
and a lot of what I've been hearing is

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,040
almost a perfect reflection of their

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,190
sales pitch to companies that are

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,230
nervous and I just want to tell you in

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,460
the case of this one company I still

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,700
don't know anybody that has a working

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,360
implementation of it like this is not

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,800
the way to fix it that there are you

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,540
know some of the stuff that Goldman

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,460
Sachs was talking about when they were

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,400
being really careful to check is a more

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,770
rational procedure to me than expecting

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,660
a third party to do a good job of this

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,440
gargantuan tasket they've set for

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,660
themselves they claim to have you know

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,940
enormous repositories of code that they

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,130
have sucked into their system and they

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,480
can compare your code against and tell

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,730
you what's going on with it

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,410
but a pretty big ask what they're

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,910
claiming they can do and if you ever

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,220
look at the report that you get back

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,710
it's not nearly as clear-cut as you

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,270
think it's gonna be or as actionable as

00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,710
it should be for what they're claiming

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,450
it does so everybody in this room

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,460
represents a company that is worried

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,520
about the nightmare scenario that's the

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,430
thing where you are embarrassed in

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,980
public or worse in a court because

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,240
something has gone wrong that's that's

00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,540
what everybody worries about

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,880
interestingly enough that fear of bad PR

00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,460
is exactly what we've been using all

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,780
these years to get open source to be

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,360
enforced because the the legal contracts

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,170
haven't been through a ton of precedent

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,750
law and so the real truth is any time a

00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,030
company steps out of line in open source

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,740
licensing what brings them back in line

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,949
is the fear of public reprisal

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,569
and so on the one hand I understand why

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,520
you're afraid of that and I have worked

00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,410
in companies where that has happened and

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,150
we've had to recover but on the other

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,400
hand that's a really necessary part of

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,910
open source and it's important I think

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,099
to realize how beneficial it can be iBM

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,009
has been surfing this line for twenty

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,660
years they're not the best citizen in

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,160
the open-source world by any stretch of

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,020
the imagination they've done some really

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,759
nasty things to open-source over the

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,199
years but they've also done some really

00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,819
good things and they get to walk right

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,949
down the line right down the middle and

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,569
they're masters at it so if you want to

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:19,650
see how to play both ends up the middle

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:23,370
look at that all right now here's the

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,710
good news first of all and I'm eluded to

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,130
this earlier with the exception of the a

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,740
GPL all open-source licenses today

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,620
trigger on distribution physical

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,590
distribution of code so what that means

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,979
is if you were twenty years ago you sold

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:44,250
code boxed in a box with some manuals

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,320
and some CDs or DVDs to you know load it

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,229
up these days of course everything's

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,509
delivered over the Internet and but

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,250
that's still distribution but the truth

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,050
is most companies offer software as a

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,820
service or a platform as a service and

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,250
the performance of the code happens

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,680
behind their firewalls and therefore

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,050
they do not trigger the obligation to

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,699
give up changes so when I hear people

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,349
say well we're worried about the GPL

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,969
there's no reason to be worried about to

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,900
kill anymore because you're never gonna

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:15,090
trip it unless you actually ship code

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,150
okay and and if you do actually ship

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,949
code like even an app and some of it is

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,469
GPL you need to be very careful that

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,539
you've created a sufficient out layer of

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,729
abstraction between that app and the

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,990
mothership of your code so that there

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,330
isn't a court case that's as well

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,060
because this app connects to this and in

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,919
a hard linked way then the implication

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,529
is that their modifications to Linux

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,390
need to be given away that is a real

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,120
problem potentially but it's really easy

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,649
to avoid super easy you just have to

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,600
architect your apps to go through a

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,339
layer of abstraction rather than

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,550
directly into production which you

00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,810
shouldn't do anyway right all right so

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,030
that's one piece of good news

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,670
now the a GPL or

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,590
a Faro GPL it's got a few names but I

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,460
thought the initials are always a GPO is

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:06,720
a license that attempted successfully to

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:09,030
close the performance gap so modern

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,240
software is not distributed it's

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,650
performed on the Internet and because

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,690
it's not explicitly called out as a

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,340
trigger in most open-source licenses it

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,540
never you know we never trigger those

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,760
obligations anymore unless you

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:26,910
physically give somebody code but the

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,850
Faro triggers on either distribution or

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,740
performance and so big companies like

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,780
Google won't even touch stuff that's a

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,450
feral license there's some really famous

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,970
code that's a feral license MongoDB

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,440
which people love to use

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,420
especially clients love it it's really

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,710
really easy to take extracts of data you

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,420
can play with them really easily

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,490
pretty soon it's in your production of

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,320
stream and you didn't BAM they didn't

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,330
even realize because it looks like it so

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,340
it's just another open source thing that

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,640
you can't afford to have it back there

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,140
right now a pharaoh knows this they put

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,060
it under that license to force you to

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,650
come to them for a side license because

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,050
they own the copyrights they can do this

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,150
and so they write they'll they'll pay

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,280
you I mean you can pay them for a

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,320
relationship that doesn't trigger just

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,120
because you're using it and that's what

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
every firm does it's the first thing I

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,260
do when I join a company and I did it at

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,610
PayPal so is there any MongoDB laying

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,730
around here yeah we use it all the time

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,650
go write a license and then and then

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,860
you're done right so it's a strategy

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,390
that some companies have used to go

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,830
ahead and put the affair Oh out there

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:38,670
and knowing that it's gonna drive side

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:41,490
business okay so the the hard side of

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,170
being in a regulated industry again the

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,290
regulations are about protecting the

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,480
consumer usually right so if you get

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,740
caught not adequately protecting the

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,930
consumer then you could have some

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,360
trouble as Mark Zuckerberg is finding

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,890
out these days and you know event it

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,900
takes a while sometimes but the wheels

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,450
of justice do eventually you know roll

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,860
right it's not that there's nothing to

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,600
be afraid of it's just that there's less

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,100
to be afraid of then it looks like when

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,130
you first appraise the situation

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,980
so why do people open-source stuff

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,350
why do they you know contribute or

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,360
especially do what Sachs is doing and

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,130
set up projects with code that they

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,750
originated that they invented why do

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:27,700
they give away their inventions anybody

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:29,830
know yeah right which is a form of

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,570
market disruption there are other things

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,030
that you can do that are disruptive with

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,830
open source my friends ajita there and I

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,720
were involved in a famous disruption

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,730
called OpenOffice that was that was

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,500
aimed at Microsoft and the 40% of the

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,570
business that they of their income that

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,580
came from office and the file format

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,300
monopolies that they had so you can use

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,880
open source in some very specific market

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,070
actionable ways making your life easier

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,690
is definitely one of them but you can

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,790
also use it to make everybody else in

00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,410
the industry do things the way that you

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,660
think they should be done for some

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,220
reason of your own like you get better

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,440
data about what your what your

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,390
competitors are doing or who knows what

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,190
the reason is but there's lots of clever

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,050
things you can do especially with first

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,660
mover advantage if you open source

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:17,710
something really cool okay does anybody

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,530
got another reason yes

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,090
recruitment and hiring number one reason

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,500
these days that I get asked to help

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,590
people learn how to do open source is

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,830
because kids that you hire expect to be

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,300
able to do it and let's face it in tech

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,860
not the most exciting kind of

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,810
engineering you can possibly do it with

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,010
you know the hedge funds are exciting

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,520
cuz you get a lot of money out of them

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,530
but fundamentally it's not the best you

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,300
need you'd rather be building stuff that

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,770
gets sold that you can point at you can

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,820
tell your mom you worked on that right

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,790
but you have to still be able to recruit

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,380
and hopefully high enough quality talent

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,210
offering the way that they want to work

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,180
as an option is a really really

00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,940
compelling thing it actually works and

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,440
we know that it works when Netflix was

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,510
going down the tubes because they

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,340
screwed up their pricing model they're

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,110
part of the remediation strategy with

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,540
some very innovative open sourcing they

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,480
did of things that are expensive to

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,250
build so they gave a gift to the

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,260
community in the form of code and it

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,890
completely fixed both their reputation

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,800
and their ability to recruit

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:27,560
so it's a real thing right anybody got

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,330
one more reason no the third reason is

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,460
because you are so dependent on the

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,480
software that you have to see that it

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,190
stays healthy right so that's a lot of

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,860
the contribution that goes into the Lynx

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,860
kernel is about continuing to make it

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,770
useful so for instance intel has had has

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,110
for a long time had a group of a lot of

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,300
engineers more than you think that does

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,340
do nothing but make sure that linux out

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,410
of the box that kernel works well on the

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,360
Intel platform and everything that means

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,730
that's why Lena Stovall's a few years

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,890
ago said in a conference if you just

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,050
want your laptop to work the way a Mac

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,990
works and you're gonna run Linux by

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:09,050
genuine Intel right that's what they

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,940
wanted him to say that but you know they

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,770
are very good at enabling platforms

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,660
agnostically like we don't care if you

00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,010
run Windows or Linux but it's gonna be a

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,040
good experience it was kind of their

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,010
idea okay

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:29,090
and what are people afraid of why do

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:30,920
people not do open-source anybody that's

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,990
right people are afraid that they're

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,240
somehow gonna get bamboozled into giving

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,820
away the secret sauce or their employees

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,570
they don't trust their employees to not

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,910
do that now that is a problem in some

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,170
companies but it also indicates you've

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,040
got some work to do on your employee

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,680
base okay when we when I was at Sun we

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,260
created the first ever public blog for

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,910
corporation called blogs at CENTCOM when

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,680
we launched it we didn't go through

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,830
legal and we did not go through HR to

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,830
set it up we had a conversation with the

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,350
CEO Jonathan Schwartz he was not as good

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,750
as Scott McNealy had been at at

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,510
massaging the message so people in the

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,460
press were not accurately reporting the

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,070
message he was trying to convey so he

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,870
wanted a venue to put written work out

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,060
that would you know this is my position

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,770
and then he could point out it right so

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,990
he was in favor of us doing this blog

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,870
space some was at a dark time at the

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,570
time and there are people who decided to

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,720
stay at Sun not bail because of the blog

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,279
that we created because it was the only

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,860
in the world at that time that had given

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,779
the employees a voice like that we

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,430
trusted our employees we gave them three

00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,689
simple rules to follow and I always

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,970
forget one of them but the important

00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:46,689
ones were we hired you because you're

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,319
smart don't up here's how you could

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,779
do that

00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:50,589
don't defame anybody don't give away a

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,149
trade secret

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,089
I always forget what the third one was

00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,620
if you do one of those three things we

00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:59,470
will add a minimum take down your blog

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,290
but we may fire you so don't do that

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,269
and it totally worked it totally worked

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,660
I only had to pull down to individual

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:10,990
blog posts one of them was my own and

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,300
that's another story but you can trust

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,899
your employees if you make what's gonna

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,959
happen super clear now it's still true

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,639
that most malicious work in in

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,889
engineering comes from employees who are

00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,569
disgruntled that's still true but again

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:28,029
if you can't clean that up you've got a

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:31,209
bigger problem than open source right

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:55,959
what's another reason why do people not

00:16:31,209 --> 00:17:14,530
do this yes you insulted the Church of

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:19,780
Java which was just right so tell me

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,250
again with the route cars okay but how

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,780
does that relate to open source and why

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:29,530
people do so you're on the blog story

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,630
stuff great

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,220
what who has another reason why people

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,130
don't open source why people are afraid

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,690
to open source cost well they are afraid

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,590
that it's gonna make them less efficient

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,750
that's true

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,399
and interestingly enough when we started

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,590
open source there was a famous article

00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,880
by by Eric Raymond that claimed that

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,860
this was cheaper people

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,500
we'll work for you for free and it took

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,930
us a long time and Sun to get to dispel

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,900
that notion because it's not true it's

00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,700
more expensive to do open source it's

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,650
not more expensive to use open source

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,410
it's more expensive to contribute than

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,270
to write it behind a firewall but you

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,380
get a lot of intangible benefits that

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,880
offset that cost what about brand risk

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,500
guys know about that one I have a slide

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,780
about that earlier that's where you

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,910
screw up and everybody knows you screwed

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,170
up because it's transparent and all of a

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,600
sudden the brands in trouble

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,880
there's headlines that say there was one

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,330
when at Sun while I was at Sundance said

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,120
son finds hole in precious GPL and

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,610
drives Mac truck through it you don't

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,410
want that quote all right brand risk is

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,990
the number one reason that people don't

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,610
do open-source and it's because they're

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,350
pretty sure they don't that they're

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,510
gonna screw it up and then it's going to

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,220
be embarrassing right and this is it

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,750
this has been a consistent problem the

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:49,630
whole time all right so now we're gonna

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,540
switch to the way engineering is if you

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,550
don't do enough open-source so how many

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,070
of you worked in a company where there

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:59,650
were discrete practices of software

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,210
around code bases and they didn't talk

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,950
to each other although code might

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,450
communicate the people who wrote the

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,950
front-end didn't really talk to the

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,790
people who are at the back end so well

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,160
right exactly

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,590
so those are called silos and they

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,040
happen then may create bottlenecks

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,450
because any time you have excessive

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,790
specialization you also have to wait

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,390
around for that specialist a lot right

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,220
and that is anti open source the idea

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,320
that you couldn't fix your own problems

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,180
as an engineer this is why github

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,580
enterprise people buy it now and put it

00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,080
up in their in their shops thinking that

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,390
it's magically you know with a little

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,770
pixie dust gonna make them more

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,720
efficient because everybody's gonna be

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,310
able to see everybody else's code but

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,440
then they do the thing they fall into

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:44,710
the trap they stay in their comfort zone

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,470
they maybe they kicked clearcase out to

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,420
put in github enterprise they're gonna

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,970
make it hub enterprise in their shop

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,620
look a lot like clearcase they're gonna

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,450
put extra processes on it they're gonna

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,520
limit who can see who else's code

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,030
they're gonna tell themselves stories

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,040
about how they're saving on license

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,320
and things but they're basically

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,820
undermining the whole value proposition

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,570
of everybody being able to see everybody

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,980
else's code right so um the bottleneck

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,400
problem I can tell you how to fix that

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,870
one this one is the problem where you

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,280
have engineers that won't give up their

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,770
secrets because they think it's gonna

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,050
keep them employed they're not good at

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,210
sharing right so that's mEagle and he's

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,430
not sharing his ring this is another

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,040
real problem and especially in companies

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,830
that think that they're innovative so or

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,720
were at one time innovative the famous

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,720
company that does this and it's actually

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,150
a religion is Apple you can get fired at

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,890
Apple today for telling the guy in the

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,310
office next to you who's working on some

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,410
other group what you're working on right

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,300
they are the extreme and that's because

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,950
Steve was like that I honestly don't

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,330
think that it's necessary anymore but

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,240
they're still kind of clinging to it

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,940
Steve like the big reveal I mean like

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,550
the minimum of news it's a trickle

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,130
before the big reveal but you know even

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,570
even 30 years ago when I worked at Apple

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,340
the way we found out what was happening

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,920
in other parts of the company was we

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,440
read math week and there was a reporter

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,360
that if you called him secretly from

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,580
inside Apple and told him about a

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,220
project that you were working on if he

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,200
got the same rumor from two vectors he

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,970
would publish it and he would send you a

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,500
coffee mug which you could then never

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,820
use at work right so and so it's not a

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,520
new thing and then the third thing

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:31,460
really is total mistrust of the employee

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,290
base and wanting to wanting to create

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,500
bumpers so the employee base can't get

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:40,790
in trouble can't hurt the brand can't

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,920
you know whatever right and in my

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,930
experience proper open-source actually

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,700
fixes this problem because all of a

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,070
sudden there is way more scrutiny than

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,620
there ever was before but you have to

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,840
set it up to be that you have to you

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,270
have to do code mentoring and code

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,920
review and you know practice that means

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,020
that people really read each other's

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,400
code and then they start noticing things

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,320
that aren't working well and they tell

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,350
you you know I used to work with

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,730
Whitfield Diffie who how co-invented RSA

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,880
encryption the reason that we can buy

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,010
stuff on the web I asked him is open or

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,660
closed inherently Morse

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,280
secur because we were hearing a lot

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,850
about closed-source being more secure

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,530
and he said there is no statistical

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,590
basis for the claim that either is more

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,870
secure but I would field if he prefer

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,600
the transparent method because I have a

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,400
better chance of finding the problem

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,200
many eyes makes make small work and

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,700
we've seen that over and over again you

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,370
know open-source software typically

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,410
patches in a matter of hours where

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,320
Microsoft was taking months to patch you

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,910
know invulnerability x' so that doesn't

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,740
mean that it's still not on your system

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,750
and to apply that patch on your version

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,610
or whatever you're using but it's an

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,030
important concept that transparency is

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,190
the new is the new safe right and that

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,740
idea that closed stuff is safe that is

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,620
like from World War two you know

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,150
official secrets act kind of stuff but

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,710
it doesn't actually work because they do

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,730
tell their wives they have you know

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,040
right okay so I'm gonna tell you about

00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,540
inner source the rest of this talk is

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,710
gonna be about inner source because it's

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,090
what I've been working on for the last

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,910
four and a half years but I think it's

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,430
the panacea for some elements of this

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,620
industry to get all the way there I will

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,210
in full disclosure for most of the last

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,770
20 years I had no interest in inner

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,900
source as an open source activist

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,530
because it did not yield public code

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:33,140
immediately but I am in my consulting

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,970
world I've had a lot of clients it used

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,140
to be really easy to find a client who

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,180
could understand what I was talking

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,390
about implemented get the benefits have

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,520
the virtuous circle but these days some

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,990
people who really really needed to get

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,360
it right and wanted to get it right

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,970
couldn't because of cultural impediments

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,080
so the famous one is Bill & Melinda

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,970
Gates Foundation

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,530
I worked with them on an educational

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,640
program that they had already announced

00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,860
it was going to be open source and they

00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,900
hired me to help them get there we set

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,720
it up but they did not fit they did not

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,790
succeed the reason they didn't was their

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,010
training at Microsoft most of them have

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,940
come from Microsoft in this group is as

00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,960
ambiguity increases you must increase

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,360
micromanagement that's how they're

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,370
taught to work and they couldn't drop it

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,020
and micromanaging your open source

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,840
community is the fastest way to kill it

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,310
the fastest way that's why the hoops

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,930
that goldman has to jump through or

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,600
little troubling because that will

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:30,350
eventually be too much dragged on

00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,509
they're developers I believe so these

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,380
three books are books that we wrote

00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:39,230
about this phenomenon I actually have a

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,330
copy of this one because Goldman Sachs

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm Michael MICEX I get hub has

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,440
reprinted this for you it's available

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,620
outside in the expo hall it's really

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,539
thin this book which I put out four

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,190
years ago and Yoram is an editor at

00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,279
O'Reilly and we co-wrote it but my name

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,460
didn't make it on the cover this book is

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,620
the most downloaded non code asset on

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,149
github which tells you it's really an

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,940
interesting topic to a lot of companies

00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:07,460
this is a story about one experiments

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,350
that we did we've done a lot of but a

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,720
lot more and this book which came out at

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,759
Austin this year is a case study book

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,889
that's got a number of stories of big

00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,960
companies who have used this technique

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:22,610
for various things not just because they

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:26,179
were afraid of open source so what inner

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,610
source does it if properly practiced it

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:30,860
can there are companies that have used

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,419
it to increase innovation there are

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,700
companies that have used it to get rid

00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:36,919
of engineering bottlenecks and silos

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,470
break silos down and create more cross

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,169
collaboration it has the side effect of

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,360
helping teams that are traditionally

00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:46,909
working with deep silos figure out how

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,409
to cut how to modular eyes so that the

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:50,600
code can actually be understood by other

00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:52,279
people more easily it builds de facto

00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,190
documentation that you can't get any

00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,710
other way out of engineers and it it

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,259
equates to velocity there's increased

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,610
velocity after the first interaction so

00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,169
the first interaction and inner source

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,899
is very expensive because it's a

00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,549
mentorship he wants to give me code but

00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:10,220
he's the code that he's giving me after

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:11,990
reading my code is not gonna work I know

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,730
it's not gonna work because we tried the

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,590
method that he's gonna try to exploit

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,940
and it falls over it doesn't scale we

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,289
already know that but we never wrote it

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,240
down because we're all on the same team

00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:22,429
we don't need to everybody knows that

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,889
but somebody on the outside doesn't know

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,279
it so I send him back a mail and I said

00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:26,720
okay

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,759
sorry we didn't document that that

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,039
method doesn't work this way but why

00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,889
don't you try this one we saved that

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,320
piece of email we put it into an archive

00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:38,299
and the next person who needs to get

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,010
something into that codebase reads the

00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,500
archive before they ask me

00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,419
for advice that's the that's your

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,890
velocity increase this is how open

00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,390
source works as well you can learn

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:51,080
everything you need to know by reading

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:54,290
the email right now is it pretty reading

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,870
a you know 300 piece threaded email not

00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,400
so good right so eventually if you if

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:01,100
you've done what I suggested and retain

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,320
them you can watch which queries get hit

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,419
the most and turn that into real

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,220
documentation right but the reason that

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,630
the engineer doesn't know to put that

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,070
out there first of all it's embarrassing

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,419
they haven't cleaned it up yet it's an

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,340
obvious thing people are coming to that

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,679
conclusion but they haven't modularized

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,090
to get rid of that problem because they

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,610
look at the codebase and they see a

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,110
whole being and they think wow am I

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,880
going to cut its head off or its legs

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,340
off like it's impossible to look at it

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,169
and go oh okay I see it needs to be cut

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,370
down until you start having a

00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,929
conversation with somebody else to

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,370
explain it and the first time you do

00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:32,600
that you go oh man this makes no sense

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,419
we have to fix this

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,270
so in resources useful for lots of ills

00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:40,910
in the industry but it definitely is a

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,679
good rehearsal for doing open source and

00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,840
in every company that I've worked with

00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,340
around inter source eventually after

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,530
they have figured out how to collaborate

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,270
internally and we started to have all

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,820
the other good internal effects of inter

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,320
source they start proposing reasonable

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,660
open source projects that are actually

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,130
going to land and that's really good to

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,530
see because then you know that it's not

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,450
going to be a waste of time I went to

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,280
PayPal expecting to teach them how to do

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,720
open source and what I found was they

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,450
didn't have anything worth opening in

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,280
their coffers and it wasn't that they're

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,309
bad engineers it was that they had a

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,080
policy of pulling the best open source

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,150
they could find bringing it inside the

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,950
company huddling around it making it

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,929
work really well for their situation and

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,880
never looking back outside to see what

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:25,760
was happening in the mother project that

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,200
they had extracted from so three years

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,910
four years later they want to open

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,120
source yet another version of MapReduce

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:34,190
and I'm like well there are 28 versions

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,010
here they are do you benchmark favorably

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,809
against any of them so it's not a good

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,850
story there's no point in wasting the

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,110
company's time doing something that

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,130
everybody else has done a million times

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:48,710
that's not good open-source policy all

00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,840
right so that velocity effect really

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,480
does happen the second the third the

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,929
20th the 500th time some

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,910
has to learn about that sila and it also

00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,970
helps the people who own the silos break

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:05,780
them down in my company both increased

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:10,280
documentation and increased modulars

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,840
ation had been like official edicts of

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,150
the company for at least two years it

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,740
had Sprint's about it they'd had and and

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,419
they weren't getting much out of it and

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,080
then we did in her source and all of a

00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:23,570
sudden they were like oh yeah ok they

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,760
could see it all and we're not the only

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,169
ones because I we started I'll tell you

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
in a little bit we started a trade

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:29,870
association so that we all hang out

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,970
together

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,309
people in big companies that are trying

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,440
to do in our source and we're starting

00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:38,450
to work on a pattern language for inter

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,070
source and lo and behold we all have the

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,650
same problems there are no new problems

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,880
it's just your company has a different

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,500
and you know this one's bigger than this

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,970
one and my in mind this one's bigger

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,690
than this one so it's just the order

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,640
that you attack them that changes so I

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,100
already talked about it being a suitable

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,500
stepping stone to open-source it is a

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,850
stepping stone because it teaches

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,150
programmers who have never been asked to

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:04,340
collaborate in this way before to do it

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,250
it dispels their fear that they're going

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,620
to not be valued if they don't have the

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,510
secrets that they hold it helps them

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,220
understand that the best gift that they

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,500
can give at the end of their careers is

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,419
mentoring new kids right that is the

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,010
best thing you can do that will make you

00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,080
live a lot longer in the memory of

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,790
everybody that ever worked with you then

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,040
the fact that you were the only one that

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,720
knew how to do something and but you

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,500
have to affection trained people to know

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,260
that that's the case

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,230
and so we produced a bunch we the inner

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,580
source Commons have been producing

00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,220
trainings free trainings online through

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,410
O'Reilly to Train about the roles of

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,230
inner source and that plus the books

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,570
that we've written it are starting to be

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,760
a set of documentation we have a hard

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,890
time describing it because unlike open

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,690
source it's not just a recipe it's you

00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,490
have to do a deep cultural assessment

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:57,080
but probably you need to do one I'm

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,429
guessing all right we have this trade

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,130
association that I alluded to earlier

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:04,190
it's called inner source Commons org it

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,260
is currently hanging off a PayPal but

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,250
they have committed to helping us stand

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,350
it up as a five

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,410
C 3 nonprofit in the United States and

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:15,110
we are open to their being chapters in

00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,940
other countries after we get that set up

00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:20,420
unlike the open source initiative we

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,920
don't bless anything as open we just are

00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,810
trying to educate people and share

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,370
stories and share patterns and fail

00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,490
faster because we're all being really

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,870
honest in order to be really honest we

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,900
work under something called Chatham

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,520
House Rules and what that means is you

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,620
can when you're sitting in one of our

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,510
summits or a talk and you want to talk

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,190
about inner source and what you're

00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,050
hearing you can say anything you want

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,970
you can tweet anything you heard as long

00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,680
as you do it in such a way that it can't

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,080
be tied back to an individual or the

00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,350
company they work for that way people

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,090
are pretty safe to actually ask the

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,770
question because nobody's gonna say wow

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,840
that Goldman Sachs just asked a really

00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,540
stupid question you know we don't do

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,340
that because all of us have have been

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,440
there right we're not interested in

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,820
shaming people and brand assassination

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,800
and all that stuff we're trying to learn

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,350
together and it's working out pretty

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,770
well it's in its fourth year and there

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:15,380
are 300 people involved more than 300

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,810
about 85 companies represented in those

00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,640
300 and a third of them are FinTech

00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,980
companies and that's an artifact of it

00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,390
having been started at PayPal but a lot

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,370
of them are not fin tech companies and

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,080
when we make it a non-profit we're gonna

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,180
do a big appeal to see if we can balance

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,860
that a little bit better but just so you

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,180
know all your friends are there already

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:37,340
there many of them are oh we also throw

00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:40,220
two summits a year and we're working on

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,970
a third in North America in Europe and

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:47,420
somewhere in Southeast Asia probably

00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:49,280
Singapore and next year we do inner

00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,650
source days at big open source

00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,050
conferences like ASEAN and it they're

00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,180
always very well attended and nobody

00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,790
ever leaves because the content is

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,290
really really interesting and we have

00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,030
also got a tutorial that takes about

00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,440
four hours to talk to people who are

00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,330
going to be change agents and their own

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,730
companies about what that's gonna feel

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,560
like and how to mitigate risk for their

00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,480
own careers and all that stuff all of

00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,880
this stuff available for free you just

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,800
have to ask for a slack account which

00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,830
you can do in an automated way through

00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:22,360
inter source of comments org

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:25,179
and let's see what is that oh so it's a

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,590
journey getting into open source the

00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:28,659
stuff that you're making yourselves

00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,179
crazy about now will be less important

00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:33,429
to you after you've got a little more

00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,929
facility with using it it's not a bad

00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,299
idea some of the checks and balances

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:41,260
that I'm hearing from banking companies

00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:43,390
but it's a big overhead and part of open

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,029
source is just about frictionless let

00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,460
you know attempt to make work fun again

00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:49,990
and we originally thought we were gonna

00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,639
get rid of all the marketers and lawyers

00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,350
that we had to deal with but now we've

00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,720
all turned into lawyers and marketers I

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,730
don't know what to say about that all

00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,019
right I am willing to ask questions but

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:02,590
our answer question Samantha do we have

00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:22,750
any time okay great anybody get a

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:24,399
question yeah that's a lot of what

00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,740
they're doing there I'm a little

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,750
concerned about the we cook the we cook

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,060
the patch inside before we throw it over

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,470
the wall because that that interrupts

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,770
the feedback loop with the rest of the

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:39,700
world and as Apple found so when Apple

00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:41,859
put the mach kernel into Mac OS they set

00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,000
up a side community that hired Jordan

00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:45,429
Hubbard who was one of the most famous

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,320
BSD programmers at that time and they

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,780
set up the Darwin community and then

00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,480
they completely never ever gave that

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,639
community any breathing space they would

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,080
start to work on problem there's a lot

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,119
of work to do they'd start as a

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,460
community to work on the next thing and

00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,140
then Apple meanwhile is working behind

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,050
the scenes on their own version of the

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,450
next thing which they would you know try

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,560
Boucher over the wall like a big cow and

00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,420
it would land in the middle of the

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,700
community and just harden people and

00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,650
they would leave so that's my first

00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,800
concern that they're gonna break that

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,560
we're all in this together feel and they

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,690
are projects that they're creating so

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,790
their job as good stewards of

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,920
open-source is to grow the number of

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,050
people who can help them and it sounds

00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,580
like there's a problem there but I

00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,630
haven't looked at it deeply enough to

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:59,170
know for sure

00:35:31,630 --> 00:36:10,539
yeah you do initially yeah it's a lot

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:12,099
harder but it fixes some problems too it

00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:14,349
is something that people do they become

00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:16,210
cynical karl fogel was one of those

00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:18,819
people he worked for the company that

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,769
originally coined the term inter Soros

00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:22,720
and his take was the middle management

00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:26,859
can derail you so easily it's really

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,990
hard right yeah but I'll tell you what

00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:31,799
he's he's he's bullish on inter source

00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:34,420
again now and the reason that he is is

00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:36,309
open source has one people want to

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,369
figure out how to get a piece of that in

00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:41,769
their work lives right most of these

00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,509
companies I'd say maybe 90% of the

00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:45,579
engineers in the world are still working

00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:47,680
in the old-fashioned engineering salt

00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:50,559
mines regardless of whether they've had

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,150
agile added on or some other practice

00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,279
added on

00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,289
fundamentally way too much control not

00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,789
enough artistry in that not why they got

00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:01,390
into it in the first place in most cases

00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:03,369
right and it's disheartening right so

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,109
what we're finding at least in the

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,329
projects that I know about and again I

00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:09,490
know about 85 companies doing this yes

00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:11,289
there can be some difficulties depending

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,240
on cultural impedimenta but it's

00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:15,519
generally beneficial and you can

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,960
demonstrate that what we advocate doing

00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,200
is start with a small controlled

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,849
experiment when I say controlled I mean

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,670
know the parameters of it within your

00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:27,789
corporation not and then micromanage it

00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,240
in fact let it go right explain how it's

00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,099
gonna work

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,950
let it go read that little booklet

00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,369
that's what we did with checkout 90% of

00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:38,890
our work went through the checkout stack

00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:41,079
90% and there were 25 of them and they

00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,789
could never get through their actual

00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,380
planned work in a given sprint because

00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:47,120
of escalations from executives demand

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,340
that they deal with this person's

00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,040
requests or that person's requests they

00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,360
were sick of escalation and they really

00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,670
had a bunch of work they needed to get

00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,620
done so they were super happy about

00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,690
adopting inter source it made them all

00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,580
you know the happiest employees in the

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,230
world because people that needed to have

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,660
inputs into their system were suddenly

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,520
doing holding their own but they also

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,190
got a quality bump because they didn't

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,900
do real code review because most most of

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,090
the time in companies were you know

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,650
demands are mostly time-based code

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,930
review goes out the window people start

00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,520
rubber stamping other people's code they

00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,110
so they got that benefit they figured

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,700
out how to modularize based on what they

00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,180
were seeing everything that was supposed

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,060
to happen

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,620
that was good happened for them right up

00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,510
until the product owners which we'd

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,370
forgotten about figured out that they

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,680
weren't letting the escalation happen

00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:35,570
anymore and they killed it because they

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,620
like it when the when the bosses talked

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,110
to each other it makes them feel like

00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,670
they can move the company so then we had

00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,560
to attack the problem of how do we keep

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,270
the product owners happy well we learned

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,790
from that experiment we could call that

00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:49,520
a failure because it's if it fell over

00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,690
but we learned and we worked on a role

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,690
for the product owners it's an

00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,940
incremental path it's not a day one

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,620
forward path the only team I know that

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,620
ever did that day one forward thing

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:03,190
excessively was Bloomberg but it fell

00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,600
over as soon as the sponsor left right

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,700
nevertheless Bloomberg's engineering is

00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,170
better now than it was then according to

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,490
them because they still come to the

00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,290
inter stores Commons because they're

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,150
trying to restart it because they they

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:17,090
got it that it helped with their culture

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,970
so yes I know about your skepticism I

00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:22,250
had that myself for twenty years but now

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:26,810
I think it is the only logical next

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,340
thing to do so that it all right I'll

00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,500
stick around in the hallway afterwards

00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,100
if you wanted

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,890
[Applause]

00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,950
