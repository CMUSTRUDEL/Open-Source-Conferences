Description: 
	Speaker: Dawn Foster, Pivotal
Presentation: Open Source Collaboration: Finding the Right Balance

Collaboration within open source projects is becoming increasingly important for most companies, but it can be difficult to strike the right balance between the needs of the company and the open source project. Dawn Foster works on open source software strategy at Pivotal and has 20+ years of experience leading open source software initiatives at companies like Puppet Labs, Intel, and Jive Software. Her talk will focus on how companies can develop a successful strategy for participation and collaboration in open source projects, including how to be a good corporate citizen.

00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm gonna go ahead and get started I'm

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,680
Don Foster I work on open source

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,070
strategy at pivotal how many of you are

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,330
familiar with of it all already ok half

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,100
and half

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,840
we basically provide a platform to give

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,580
enterprise customers kind of an easy

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,340
easy way to build and run their

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,560
applications in the cloud like most tech

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,710
companies we're hiring so so that's my

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,480
entire plug for pivotal right there I'm

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,050
happy to chat about it but this talk is

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,670
not about pivotal so today I'm going to

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,340
talk with how Co how companies can

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,160
better collaborate within open source

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,989
projects the reality is that for years

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,079
right we've been using tons of open

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:56,219
source software since so much of our

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,500
infrastructure is dependent on it and as

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,890
more and more as more and more companies

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,690
depend on the software becoming involved

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,689
in some of these projects becomes almost

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,360
inevitable in some ways and because the

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,130
software is developed in public within

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,740
these open source communities as

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,320
companies we need to spend some time

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,810
really thinking about the best ways to

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,979
collaborate in these projects to avoid

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,990
making public and very visible mistakes

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,640
with a bit of thought you can help

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,820
ensure that your employees can

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
participate in ways that will reflect

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,950
positively on the company's reputation

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,240
within the industry so that's what I'm

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,070
going to talk about in this session I

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,500
should also mention that if you go too

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,000
fast wonder blog comm and click on the

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,549
speaking link the slides are already

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,950
posted so if you know one take notes if

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,090
you want the slides they're already

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,000
there for you first I'll tell you just a

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,640
little bit more about me I've spent more

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,409
than 20 years working in the technology

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,869
industry and most of that time I've

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,579
actually been focused on open source

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:05,189
I've been director of community puppet

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,930
community lead for Intel's open source

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,539
Technology Center amongst a bunch of

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,960
other things but I ended up working in

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,050
open source sort of accidentally

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,900
I managed somehow to lock into a UNIX

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,610
said munro at a local manufacturing

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,260
company is my very first job out of

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,540
university which is pretty fantastic

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,120
that was that was the mid-90s so it was

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,460
a different world but at the time

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,820
manufacturing companies did not want to

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,800
spend money on IT so I used mostly

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,740
open-source tools because that's what

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,380
was available a few years later I was a

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,140
program manager at Intel I ended up on a

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,480
project to look at Linux developer tools

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,920
especially the open-source tools to help

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,170
them figure out which ones were going to

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,930
be strategic and important for Intel in

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,600
this and for specific projects in the

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,180
future and since I had used open-source

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,030
tools in the past and I had been I had a

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,110
UNIX background which as far as people

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,180
knew it was pretty much the same thing

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,100
as Linux so they just sort of threw this

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,880
project in my direction and enter my

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,250
career and open source and that's pretty

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,650
much what I've been doing for the past

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,530
almost 20 years and much of this work

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,320
has been focused on helping companies

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,030
and their employees collaborate within

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,380
open source projects in ways that

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,350
benefit both the company and the

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:28,310
community and that's what inspired me to

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,660
do this talk so before we dive into

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,220
talking about how your company and your

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,660
employees collaborate and open source

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,760
projects let's talk a little bit about

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,800
how collaboration works within open

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,100
source projects how many of you actively

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,860
contribute to open source software now

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,170
ok a few how many of your how many of

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,550
your companies already contribute to

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:54,310
open source software ok very good

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,850
so from the outside open-source projects

00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,370
may look pretty chaotic right but there

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,860
is generally some structure that governs

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,920
how people collaborate within them

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,900
now the catch here is that this

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,640
structure is going to be a little bit or

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,550
possibly completely different for each

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,870
project that you work in now quite a few

00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,250
of the projects have the structure

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,200
documented somewhere which is awesome

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,580
but for a lot of them you really have to

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,500
learn about structure by participating

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,380
because it's not particularly well

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,610
documented but despite the differences

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,260
in the structure most of them have

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,470
something that looks a little bit like

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,210
this so at the top there's generally

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,860
some sort of leadership right like

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,620
anything that's where the responsibility

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,420
for big project decisions are made now

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,480
might be a single person likeliness

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,620
Torvalds for Linux for other projects

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,570
the leadership might be part of a

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,170
foundation made up of some combination

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:52,780
of Board of Directors committees so

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,110
things like Cloud Foundry Libre Office

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,610
you know projects like that now beneath

00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,590
that or a group of maintained errs and

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,030
these are generally the people who are

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,710
responsible for maintaining certain

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,950
sections of the source code or possibly

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,160
certain chunks of functionality and in

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,480
most cases quite a bit of the work and

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,460
decision making is actually delegated to

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,840
these maintained errs and this is where

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,110
most of the day-to-day decisions about

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,880
the project are made and then there are

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,260
also committers who have usually

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,540
permission to change things in certain

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,400
certain areas and then work submitted by

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,050
regular contributors is generally

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
subject to some sort of review and

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,430
approval before it's included in the

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,230
project contributors submit changes to

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,050
source code documentation whatever their

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,850
contribution happens to be and then

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,250
those are reviewed and either accepted

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:44,560
or sent back hopefully with some

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,940
feedback and that feedback comes from

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,030
maintainer Zork emitters or more

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,350
experienced project members and then and

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,030
then there are users so this is

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,210
generally the biggest chunk of people

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,650
and the users tend up to make up tend to

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,390
make up the rest of the broader of the

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,490
source community so these are the people

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,800
consuming the software in various ways

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,150
but you haven't actually stuck stepped

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,340
up to contribute

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,860
in lots of cases contributors start as

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,570
users and then may eventually move up to

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,820
more experienced positions like commit

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,680
or maintainer but the reality is that

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,330
most users never actually contribute

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,800
directly to the open-source project in

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:23,590
any way now again while there are some

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,800
exceptions most open-source projects are

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,610
centered around the individual

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,850
contributions come from individuals

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,530
rather than companies and some projects

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,600
like the Linux kernel there's actually

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,199
no direct way for companies to

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,870
participate

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,300
other than dedicating time from

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,770
individual employees who then contribute

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,780
on behalf of the company which is

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,880
becoming really common in lots of

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,190
projects and when I worked at Intel we

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,440
had entire teams of people who worked on

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,800
full time on open source projects like

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,199
the Linux kernel Android KVM and a bunch

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,510
of other stuff and we have something

00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,220
similar pivotal right we have people

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,880
working full-time on things like Cloud

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,550
Foundry RabbitMQ spring and a bunch of

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,760
other stuff kubernetes now the catch is

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,250
that in most projects the leadership

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,289
position actually stays with the

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,599
individual if that person changes jobs

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,860
so this means that an employee can take

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,070
their leadership position in a project

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,860
and they take it right to the next job

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,039
with them so companies are well served

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,430
to make sure that these people are happy

00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:32,830
well compensated but however this also

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,840
means that if as a company you aren't

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,699
sure how to contribute you might be able

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,160
to hire an existing contributor or

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,690
possibly even a maintainer to do the

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,760
work on the project for your on your

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:48,010
behalf I also have plenty of small world

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,180
moments in open source projects for

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,120
people that I've worked with in past

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,400
projects pop up again and again in other

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,710
communities that I'm a part of so it's

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,510
important to keep in mind that you're

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,590
likely to run into these same

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,050
individuals over and over and over so be

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:08,289
thoughtful and kind when working with

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,860
other people if you're a big jerk in one

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,349
community other people will remember

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,680
this and bring your reputation with them

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:18,960
on to the next project and the next

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,830
which can reflect really badly not just

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,960
on you but also on your current employer

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,030
the flip side of this is that as an

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
employer it's worth doing a bit of due

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,199
diligence to see how someone has behaved

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,370
in previous open-source communities

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,140
before hiring them

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:40,560
hiring them to do some work on your

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:43,469
behalf now left is a quick intro into

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,760
how the contribution works next up we'll

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,910
talk about how to build a contribution

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,350
strategy and plans for participating in

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:55,230
open source projects the most important

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,940
part of putting together strategies and

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,170
plans for your open source contributions

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,750
is aligning them with overall business

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,100
goals for your company if your open

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,010
source engagements do not actually

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,290
support any of the overall strategies of

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,910
your organization you are going to

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,470
drastically reduce the chance of

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,440
anything you're doing anything you do

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,339
being successful by taking some time and

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,080
effort to make sure that you're

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,140
supporting those overall corporate

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,839
strategies then it'll be a lot easier to

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,250
justify continuing these efforts during

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,089
the next planning cycle for your

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,250
organization

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,110
on the other hand when your goals are

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,540
not clearly aligned with the corporate

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,070
strategy people will look at your open

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,430
source participation is something that

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,110
can be at best cut at worst just starved

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,200
of resources until it sort of goes away

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,850
on its own but this will also help you

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,850
make the case to senior management and

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,830
company executives who aren't likely to

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,750
be involved in the low level details of

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,150
what you're doing and explaining how

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,760
your open source contributions support

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,040
the goals of the company can help the

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:04,050
exec team understand the importance of

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,760
your work and also on the other side so

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,610
when while some employees might see

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,950
collaborating on open source projects to

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,600
be sort of its own reward

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,000
having a solid strategy can also help

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,589
employees understand how their open

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,250
source work contributes to the success

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,040
of the company

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,260
so as an employee I know that I really

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,630
like seeing that my work is having an

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,240
impact and contributing to helping the

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,880
company achieve their their goals it

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,260
makes you feel good as an employee

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,680
now one of the things you'll need to

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,200
decide is which projects used you should

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,360
contribute you now that sounds really

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,500
easy right you just contribute to all

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,960
the government source projects you use

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,530
but if you're like any company I've ever

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,940
worked for

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,540
that's probably hundreds if not

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,890
thousands of projects and unless you're

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,040
Google you aren't likely to have the

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,500
resources to contribute to all of them

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,350
so and also for many of the really big

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,230
complex open-source projects things like

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,340
Linux and kubernetes you not only have

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,140
to think about whether to contribute to

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,060
the project you probably also need to

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,010
think about exactly which part of the

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,990
project you want to contribute to and

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,480
this again is we're thinking about

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,430
company strategy comes in so which of

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,660
these open-source projects are strategic

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,800
in some way for your organization maybe

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,190
there are some projects that your

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,560
operations team uses to run some piece

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,790
critical piece of infrastructure are

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,130
there maybe some development and

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,130
deployment tools that have an impact on

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,810
your ability to release your products

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,050
for your customers that generate revenue

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:42,190
for your organization is there other

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,930
software that that's important for your

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,420
ability to deliver customer facing

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,760
products and services and all of these

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,740
among lots of other things are things to

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,080
think about when you're deciding which

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,540
open-source projects your employees

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,730
should participate in you should also

00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,980
look at where you've already contributed

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,480
to open source projects so in some cases

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,180
you might have employees you've already

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,760
fixed bugs or maybe added new features

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,470
or functionality to existing projects to

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,900
meet some company requirement or need

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,760
and some of these may have been

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,780
contributed back to an open source

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,160
project already others might be still

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,320
internal and haven't actually been

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,700
contributed back but in both cases that

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,080
can help to understand what

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,470
contributions and changes have already

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,730
been made and why they were made and to

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,590
see if it would be beneficial to

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,190
continue to contribute to those open

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,190
source projects

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,970
after you've decided which projects to

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,890
support you have to figure out what

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,770
resources are required like any plan

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,450
right as I mentioned earlier companies

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,340
contribute to open source projects by

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,950
having employees participate and

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,180
collaborate within those projects so you

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,640
need to figure out how many people you

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,310
need and more importantly what skills

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,990
are required for those people in some

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,630
cases you might have employees with the

00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,740
skills already maybe people who have

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,480
contributed to other open source

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,470
projects in the past which makes it a

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,960
good starting point for new

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,390
contributions but the thing to keep in

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,780
mind is that contributing to open source

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,270
projects requires different skills than

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,490
participating in internal projects these

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:22,030
people need to be really comfortable in

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:24,520
very ambiguous environments and they'll

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,620
receive possibly they'll receive

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,640
feedback possibly very difficult or

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,830
negative feedback which they're then

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,770
expected to respond to this feedback in

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,650
public in a professional manner and also

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,390
keep in mind that not every employee

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,280
wants their work to be in the public

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:46,180
spotlight which feels a little like

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,710
being under the microscope sometimes and

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,600
as I mentioned earlier if you don't have

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,730
the skills internally you might be able

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,560
to find existing contributors that you

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,280
can hire but you also need to be a

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,360
little bit careful about this option too

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,780
because you don't want to get a

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,880
reputation in an open-source project for

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,720
aggressively poaching employees from

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,970
other organizations it requires quite a

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,180
bit of nuance to make it known that

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,880
you're interested in hiring people to

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,470
work on these projects without then

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,640
aggressively hiring them away from

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,680
people and some projects you can

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,410
actually gain additional influence by

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,930
sponsoring or becoming a member for

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,630
example companies who join the hyperlink

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,460
ledger project at the premier level

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,890
which costs two hundred and fifty

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,170
thousand dollars they get to appoint a

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,600
person to the Governing Board amongst

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,640
other benefits now many open source

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,530
projects I would I would say probably

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,000
most open-source projects do not have an

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,880
option where you can pay to gain

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,140
fluence but some of them do especially

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,240
some of the ones that have a lot of

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,530
corporate participation and if you're

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,910
interested in participating in those

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,630
projects you should look at that as an

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,920
option if you can afford it you should

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,690
also think about what guidelines or

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,120
processes you might want to put in place

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,680
to help people engage in open-source

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,410
projects in ways that benefit your

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,420
organization these often contain

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,760
guidance about Licensing avoiding

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,560
accidental disclosures of confidential

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,560
information maybe some internal review

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,680
processes just to mention a few but my

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,560
caution about guidelines and processes

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,400
is that they're often written in ways

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,400
that discourage contributions especially

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,690
when they use really scary legal jargon

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,480
with an emphasis on punishing people

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,100
when things go wrong instead you're

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,140
often better off writing the guidelines

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,940
in ways that actually help engineers

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:45,220
understand what you want them to do and

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,070
why and language that can be easily

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,510
understood bonus points for making it as

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,190
easy as possible for your employees to

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,280
contribute to open source projects in

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,900
ways that benefit your company and then

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,400
finally if you have a lot of open source

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,410
collaboration across a whole bunch of

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,270
projects you might consider putting an

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,610
open-source program office in place so

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:06,820
this can kind of help Corral some of

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:12,550
your open source activities as well as

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:14,470
being a resource for people now it's

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,040
with any good strategy and plans the

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,600
outcome and results should be measurable

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,480
so that you can actually tell whether or

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,050
not your efforts were successful now I

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,050
love data

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,089
so measuring open source project success

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,400
is kind of a hobby for me that's what

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,630
that says about me but it's something

00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,010
that I do feel pretty passionate about

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,580
so I tend to get loads of questions

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,380
about metrics usually the questions are

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,070
focused on how to decide what to measure

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,630
and this is generally in my opinion sort

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,990
of the wrong question and my answer is

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,120
generally the same and it depends so

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,310
what you measure depends on what you're

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,600
trying to achieve which is why the

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,690
slides in the strategy and planning

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,030
section but ultimately you need to look

00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,600
at your strategies and plans and come up

00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,190
with criteria that will help

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,400
measure whether or not that plan was

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,929
successful so for example if you want to

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,059
improve the performance of a particular

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,429
piece of open-source software then

00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,130
you'll want to have success criteria and

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,500
measurement based on improvement in

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,030
specific types of performance so

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,319
measuring things like number of commits

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,459
is not going to tell you whether or not

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,819
you improved the performance of a

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:24,140
project if you want to gain if your goal

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,089
is to gain influence within an

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,799
open-source project for whatever reason

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,530
maybe you measure increases in

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,630
contributions or the number of employees

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,900
moving into positions of influence like

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,000
maintainer x' and then once you figure

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,860
out the criteria you need to make sure

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,380
that you can get the data to measure it

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,730
and start measuring it now to get a good

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,640
baseline data before you've actually

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:50,000
started to work on it if possible and

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,620
there are loads of tools available to

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,330
gather contribution data about open

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,100
source projects some of the most

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,940
commonly used ones can be found in the

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,799
linux foundation's

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,350
kaos project which is something i'm

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,360
involved in and many big projects

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:06,260
already have dashboards using these

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,700
tools and others so you can already get

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:12,140
contribution data for a lot of the big

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:14,510
projects I also recommend over measuring

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,030
a little bit and gathering as much data

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,260
as you can about your participation so

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,750
that if your strategy shifts in the

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,370
future it's more likely that you'll have

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,309
at least a little bit of baseline data

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,169
to start out with and having some extra

00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:29,090
data it can also help you come up with

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,880
more ideas for maybe how you might want

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:35,450
to participate in the future as well

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,950
helps you find gaps things like that now

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,080
that you figured out what you want to do

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,559
let's talk about how to do it while

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,850
being a good corporate citizen and

00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:47,559
avoiding some common but embarrassing

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:50,390
mistakes so the first step is to join

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,580
again as each project is different

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,710
what you need to do to join the

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,100
community will vary but it can usually

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,090
be found by looking at the website or

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,820
documentation specifically in

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,760
contributor or community sections at the

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,580
website now usually this would include

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,040
some type of mailing list or forum IRC

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,750
and slack other communication channels

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,490
and then you'll also want to find the

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,230
repos of the source code can be found

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,910
so that you can start having a look at

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,850
it and get a feel for the structure and

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,960
typical contributions these days the

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,160
codes usually found in github not always

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,920
you'll also want to have a close look at

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,010
the project documentation especially the

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:34,070
contribution Docs so spend whatever time

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,720
it takes to really fully understand the

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,820
contribution guidelines the code of

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,490
conduct the other expectations for

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,380
collaboration within the project the

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,450
expectations for contributors again are

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,950
different for every single project so

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,540
don't assume that just because you've

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,160
contributed to open source projects in

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,600
the past that you know how to contribute

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,450
to a new project that you're just

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,660
starting to get involved in I also

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,460
cannot emphasize enough that I recommend

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,380
taking some time to lurk in the

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,600
community and understand how people

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,350
participate I have seen over the years

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,780
way too many really overeager new

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,460
community members jump into the

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,290
community kind of with both feet they

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,730
make all kinds of mistakes they violate

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,010
community norms they talked about things

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,360
that aren't relevant and generally kind

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,010
of just make a mess of things for

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,620
themselves

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,090
now everybody makes mistakes but some of

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,980
them can be avoided by actually taking

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,230
the time to learn about the community

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,840
rather than barging in and trying to be

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,180
an active participant on day one so

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,730
really seriously do not be afraid to sit

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,800
back and learn from other community

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,290
members and by taking the time to

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,880
observe and lurk for a bit you can learn

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,710
about how people behave and get a feel

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,530
for how people typically respond within

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,180
this environment now when you've spent

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,220
some time understanding the expectations

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,710
for how to contribute you should start

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,500
with something small so I've also seen

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,390
companies spend a ton of time working on

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,250
huge new features for an open-source

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,560
project but they do it all internally

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,940
and then they dump it out into the open

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,380
source community and in a lot of cases

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,200
it's just one massive contribution that

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,230
nobody was expecting and in many cases

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,410
this is unfortunately a huge waste of

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,510
time for everyone involved

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,770
so the contributions unlikely to be

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,320
aligned with project goals or

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,120
expectations the company and the

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,010
employees have wasted a whole bunch of

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,040
time working on something

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,080
that may require a ton of rework if it

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,580
ever gets accepted or it may just not

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,890
get accepted at all in which case is a

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,900
complete waste of time and then on the

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,210
on the flip side the maintainer x' need

00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,460
to spend a ton of time reviewing it and

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,650
explaining why certain parts of it or at

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,790
worse all of it aren't acceptable so

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,890
you're better starting off with some

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,930
really small things like bug fixes for

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,580
example and that allows you to learn

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,260
about the contribution process with some

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,000
small changes and sort of figure out how

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:59,300
things work once you start participating

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,630
you should expect feedback now sometimes

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:06,320
this feedback will be kind other times

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:08,270
not so much as much as you might want to

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,280
fire back when you get that negative

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,990
piece of feedback you're really only

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,210
likely to start a flame war which is

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,090
just going to reflect badly on you as an

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,640
individual and also on your employer so

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,730
it's better in the long run to wait to

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,680
respond until you can cool off a bit and

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,660
maybe take the high ground so even when

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,220
the feedback is harsh there will

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,410
probably be some things you'll need to

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,110
do to rework your contribution so you

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,300
can maybe focus on focus on those focus

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,760
on the changes you need to make and in

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,620
some cases you might need to have really

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,130
hard discussions with people about the

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,560
technical merits of your contribution

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,790
but if you can focus on the problem

00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,470
deliver it maybe with a bit of kindness

00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:52,070
while avoiding attacks on the other

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,600
person it can help you it can also help

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,480
to have someone else read your response

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,890
before you post it publicly because they

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,570
might be able to catch any issues with

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,500
tone that may make you sound a lot more

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:05,060
harsh than you realize and this is this

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,640
is frankly an incredibly difficult line

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,290
to walk sometimes but staying

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,510
professional and being kind to other

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,250
people while responding to difficult

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,560
feedback can make a big difference to

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,330
your personal reputation and also the

00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,810
reputation of your employer within these

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,910
communities in many cases especially

00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,860
when you're new in a community you

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,840
should really expect to iterate on

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,730
feedback so after you submit your

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,740
changes to accommodate the first wave of

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,500
feedback you're likely to get more

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,960
feedback on those changes so consider it

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,119
in an iterative process but this means

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,649
that you really should plan

00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,129
the time that it takes to go through

00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:44,659
multiple waves of feedback submitting

00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:46,699
something at the last minute right

00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:49,039
before release window closes or a code

00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:50,719
freeze and expecting it to be included

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,699
it's just gonna be frustrating for you

00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,899
and for everybody else involved so give

00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,709
yourself just as much time as you

00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,509
possibly can

00:23:54,709 --> 00:24:01,849
for multiple waves of feedback and

00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:04,459
resubmit processes now after you get

00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:05,869
those first few small contributions you

00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:07,759
want to make sure that for the bigger

00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,709
stuff you spend some time discussing

00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,719
proposed changes in the community before

00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,279
you start working on them by talking

00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:16,099
about them really early in the process

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,419
you can get feedback on ways to

00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:19,099
architect the changes so they'll be

00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:21,169
consistent with the expectations of the

00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,729
project you'll also learn about maybe

00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:28,759
anyone else who might be working on

00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:30,439
something similar and it can also help

00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,959
to break these big changes in several

00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:35,599
smaller easier to digest contributions

00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:37,639
so it's a lot easier for maintainer x'

00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,739
to find the time to provide feedback on

00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,239
smaller contributions and it gives you

00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:43,249
time to make corrections if anything

00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,659
you're doing isn't quite right so this

00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,799
allows you again to iterate on the

00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,389
feedback through several smaller

00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:52,309
contributions as a part of a bigger

00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:55,639
bigger effort now it's also it's really

00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:57,349
important to keep in mind that you don't

00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:59,539
have any control over the other

00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:01,429
participants in this project this is

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,979
very different from working within a

00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:05,899
company where you can escalate issues to

00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:07,639
managers who can work to resolve

00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:10,279
problems with any difficult or

00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,929
non-responsive employees in open-source

00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,389
projects there really isn't a chain of

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,519
command or other ways to exert this type

00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:18,769
of control over the people that you

00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:21,529
collaborate with so instead you really

00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:24,349
do need to strive to be kind easy to

00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:25,939
work with since you really may need fun

00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:32,029
may need to find ways to influence

00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:33,319
people on your own as a result a lot of

00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,179
the work that we do in open source

00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,969
projects is based on the relationships

00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:40,879
that we have with other people I just

00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:43,519
finished my PhD which was focused on

00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:45,949
research into collaboration within the

00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,599
Linux kernel and as part of that

00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:49,429
research I did a bunch of quantitative

00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,560
research but I also interviewed a bunch

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:53,290
of kernel developers

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,580
and all of the interviews they talked

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,770
about the importance of their

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,020
relationships with other people almost

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,150
all of them talked about the how these

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,910
existing relationships they had made it

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,580
a lot easier to collaborate with others

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,220
and all all of the people that I talked

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,920
to you mentioned in-person collaboration

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,440
at conferences and other meetings as

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,450
something that was really important

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,280
people talked about how it was nice how

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,800
it's easier sometimes to work they're

00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,090
really difficult big issues at

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,580
conferences when you can work with

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,200
people face to face but it's also a lot

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,200
easier to communicate with someone

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,910
online if you've met them before maybe

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,530
shared a meal or a drink or just had a

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,770
really nice conversation with them at an

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,240
event because knowing that the human

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,550
being on the other side of the keyboard

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,550
can make a bigger difference than what

00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:45,100
you might realize now if your employees

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,450
are working on open-source projects then

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,970
you should see if there any conferences

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,770
where large numbers of other community

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,350
members attend by having some key

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,240
employees attend those conferences they

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,580
can build deeper lasting relationships

00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,630
with others that will benefit both your

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,670
company and your employees now I've

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,410
spent I've spent loads of time at

00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,210
conferences like this at open-source

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,770
conferences over the years and I've

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,030
built deep and lasting connections with

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,820
people that I've met at these

00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,050
conferences and now what I need to do

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,420
something or have a question about

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,460
something I generally know someone who

00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,530
can point me in the right direction and

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,060
I often use some of that influence to

00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,280
make introductions for other employees

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,420
at my company to people who might be

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:32,440
able to help them with their work as

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:34,390
well now up streaming your patches helps

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,970
make you helps helps you become a good

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:38,620
corporate citizen but it also has quite

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,270
a few internal benefits for your company

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,740
so if you aren't familiar with

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,350
upstreaming this just means that when

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,150
you make patches or fix a bug or solve

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,220
some internal need that you submit those

00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,260
patches back to the open-source project

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,690
rather than continuing to maintain them

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,360
internally so when you maintain patches

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,460
internally every time the open source

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,860
project releases fixes or other updates

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,930
you need to go through the work of

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,539
reapplying your patches and even

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,879
possibly rewriting some of the

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:08,190
Chiz if they touched a bits of the code

00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:10,590
that were changed in the update the side

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,460
effect of this sometimes difficult and

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,799
painful process

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:18,419
is that people tend to put off applying

00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:19,950
updates which is fine unless it's a big

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,169
security fix or something really

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,330
important and well it takes more time

00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,700
upfront you're better off taking the

00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:28,139
time to submit these patches into the

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,669
open source project where they can be

00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,039
properly maintained as part of the

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:33,869
project where and where other people can

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,399
benefit from them the easier you can

00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:37,289
make it for your employees to contribute

00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:39,359
these changes back into open source

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:41,970
projects the better off you'll be

00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,590
and in general up storming patches is

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,809
sort of considered the right thing to do

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,729
in open source projects which again

00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:54,629
helps maintain your status as a good

00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:56,970
corporate citizen understanding

00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:58,139
maintenance expectations is also a big

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,779
part of being a good corporate citizen

00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:03,179
so putting large chunks of code into an

00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:05,070
open source project disappearing and

00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,379
expecting someone else to maintain those

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:10,169
changes reflects very poorly on your

00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:12,570
organization if you fix a small bug or

00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:14,070
make really minor changes it's unlikely

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,690
you'll be expected to maintain those

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,129
changes since there's probably a

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,739
maintainer somewhere who's responsible

00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:21,269
for that section of the code but where

00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,399
you really need to think about this is

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:26,129
when you're making large contributions

00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,999
like on your feature a new driver you'll

00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,889
need to make sure that your employees

00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:31,229
are planning to maintain the code over

00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:35,369
the long term before you contribute it

00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:37,139
into the open source project now if you

00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,690
want to open-source something that you

00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:42,929
have internally if you want to open

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,249
source something because it's old crusty

00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:44,540
and you just don't want to maintain it

00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,720
anymore

00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,559
[Music]

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,940
please please don't just don't do that

00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,739
dumping your project into the open

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,299
source community and hoping that someone

00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:57,389
else would be just dying to take over

00:29:54,299 --> 00:30:00,989
this crusty old code and help you out is

00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:03,419
at best a wee bit naive and generally

00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:04,979
makes your company look bad so make sure

00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,830
that you're open sourcing the project

00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:09,570
for the right reasons so for example a

00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,359
desire to collaborate with other people

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,820
and innovate on your project is a good

00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,529
reason to open-source it if a project

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,510
will need to integrate with a load of

00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:19,710
other technology

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,450
open-sourcing it can make it easier for

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,740
people to help you integrate it with

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,260
technologies that maybe you're less

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,900
familiar with it's another good reason

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,150
loads of good reasons as I mentioned

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,280
earlier your company again needs to be

00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,200
prepared to maintain the project over

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,700
the long term just as you would if you

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,100
release something under proprietary

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,370
license this will take time and

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,610
resources so you should plan for that

00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,900
now where I see companies usually

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,510
drastically underestimate the amount of

00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,740
effort required is related to the time

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,660
it takes to collaborate with the

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,760
community you'll need to have people

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,220
available to answer questions discuss

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,929
new features and provide feedback on

00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,150
these new contributions from people

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:02,250
every company I've ever worked for has

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,980
struggled to manage incoming pull

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,809
requests for open source projects since

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,100
it takes quite a bit of time to evaluate

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:10,650
those contributions and provide

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,530
meaningful feedback and the people

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,780
working on those pull requests really

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,690
need to be comfortable providing tough

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,850
feedback the reality is that some pull

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,330
requests will contain really poor

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:26,280
quality code or possibly never be merged

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,370
because of some fundamental conflicts

00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,510
with the direction of the project now

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,160
it's easy to ignore these and hope they

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,250
go away

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,350
protip they won't but a pile of

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,660
neglected pull requests just tends to

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,970
make you look like sort of a bad bad

00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,800
open-source citizen and it's important

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,900
that employees respond to these in a way

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,510
that's clear about the future of the

00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,040
contribution but also shows empathy and

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,010
appreciation for the hard work that

00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,780
someone put into that contribution now

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,270
well it's tough and frankly it's not

00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,770
always realistic but the better you can

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,660
be at keeping up with full requests

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,150
shows that you do actually care about

00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,929
the community and helps with your good

00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:10,559
corporate citizen standing now here are

00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:11,940
a few resources and guides some of which

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,770
influence the work on this presentation

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,830
others I just think you might find

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,520
helpful again the slides are already up

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,840
on my website so you can get the slides

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,610
fun fact I was actually the ghostwriter

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,030
for the to do group participating in

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,800
open source communities guide so a fair

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,330
bit of this material is similar to that

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,920
one because I wrote both of them

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,550
and my thinking about open source

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,590
projects it's not changed in nine months

00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,840
so with that I will thank you and open

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,490
it up for questions how much time do I

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,260
have for questions we have a timekeeper

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,510
someone who's responsible for keeping me

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:51,050
honest I have ten minutes eight minutes

00:32:47,510 --> 00:33:03,750
perfect eight minutes eight questions

00:32:51,050 --> 00:33:13,920
yes my view on Amazon's approach to opus

00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:15,630
art yeah so I've never worked that

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:29,960
closely with Amazon I don't have a ton

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:33,240
of experience but what they do yeah yeah

00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,150
yeah I mean in so-so not to not speak

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,760
badly of any any companies but in in

00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:42,900
general if if you're if you're making

00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,240
heavy use of a project it's theirs yeah

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,100
I mean it's the right thing to do I

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,960
think to contribute some back to the

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,700
project but I would be surprised that

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,310
there if there wasn't stuff that they

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,660
that they needed put into the project

00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:58,610
that they should be that they should be

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,610
contributing back yeah

00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:12,150
so Zahida I'm a lit i'ma let the heeta

00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:15,260
talk for a minute because she's our

00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,260
resident Amazon expert

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,889
[Music]

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:08,710
a lot of

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,990
okay so to summarize that Amazon is

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,760
doing some contributions but it might

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,640
not be entirely visible and people

00:35:51,760 --> 00:36:00,549
should chat about it later other

00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,900
questions I can just stare awkwardly

00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:04,260
until someone has a question okay

00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,049
there's a question in the back yeah oh

00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,049
no sorry okay

00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:10,049
yes

00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,599
yeah so that felt like had two questions

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,579
so one was you know what have I seen

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,599
change in open-source and the the other

00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:57,039
bit was more around people's individual

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,460
contributions and whether or not the

00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,960
personal element comparing that to you

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,019
like just contributing code or whatever

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,749
I do think that people skills are

00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:09,609
probably the thing that a lot of people

00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:11,740
struggle with in open-source communities

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:12,819
because generally people people know how

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,079
to code or they know how to write

00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:16,599
documentation or they know how to

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,630
contribute other things and where people

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,970
tend to get tripped up a bit is around

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,319
the interactions with other people

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,920
because it can be it can be difficult

00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,900
we're humans were squishy we're messy

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,249
and working together can be difficult

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,869
especially when there's no sort of

00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:33,220
moderating influence of a company and

00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:35,920
management structures and things like

00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:40,150
that the other piece of that question

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,009
which kind of around around trends in in

00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,420
open source I think the the biggest

00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,970
trend that I've seen probably over the

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,160
last you know 15 20 years is the

00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,839
increase in corporate involvement in

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,089
open source projects it used to be a lot

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,470
more a lot more volunteers and now you

00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:55,690
have projects like Linux where almost

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,739
everyone's being paid to contribute and

00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,690
I also think there's loads of

00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:01,410
consolidation going on within the

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:05,710
industry so lots of high-profile

00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:08,920
acquisitions recently Red Hat with IBM

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,720
kept do VMware and then also a lot of

00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,989
consolidation in some of the foundations

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,950
as well so what was it that Red Hat just

00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:22,539
contributed to a foundation staff maybe

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:24,660
this week other other questions yeah one

00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,660
more

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,019
yeah so the the question was getting

00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:22,489
other people to contribute to your open

00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:24,380
source project and invest in your source

00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:27,259
project is really really hard and don't

00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,699
have any suggestions for that it is

00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:30,890
really really hard to be honest that

00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,910
that is probably the hardest thing about

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,180
running an open source project

00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:38,469
especially if it's something smaller is

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:41,269
is getting attention for it so you know

00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:43,219
you look and it's easy to look at

00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:44,599
projects like like kubernetes but that

00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,739
comes out of Google and there's tons of

00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,089
resources and there's all this

00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:48,910
excitement around the project but there

00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:51,410
are loads of other smaller projects that

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:54,319
are interesting to certain segments of

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,359
people and and it is it is really hard

00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,299
to get people interested in your project

00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:01,009
I mean about about all you can do is

00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:03,619
kind of is talk to people and try to get

00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:04,729
people excited about it sometimes that

00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:06,499
works sometimes it doesn't

00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:07,940
I wish I had an easy answer to that

00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:09,890
question because I probably get that

00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,099
question more than any other and it's

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,099
hard

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:27,880
yeah yeah yeah this is really hard I

00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:30,450
think I think we're we're out of time

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,450
for questions

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:39,910
mm-hmm yeah so the comment was you know

00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,529
maybe marketing can play a role in that

00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:45,940
and that is absolutely that is

00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:47,049
absolutely for sure and that's also part

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,160
of the piece that a lot of open source

00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:49,359
projects struggle with because they

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,319
don't have a lot of people responsible

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,319
for marketing so Heda

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:35,550
yeah all right I think we're done

00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:39,399
[Applause]

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,399
