Presentation: Lessons learned implementing ChatOps (DevOps + messaging) at large Enterprises

Email overload, distributed teams and excessive meetings have caused many organizations to move their DevOps teams to messaging platforms and thus adopt ChatOps workflows. With thousands of open source installs and hundreds of customer implementations, we have a few lessons to share on interesting DevOps workflows, how incidents can be effectively communicated across distributed teams and what messaging in secure and regulated environments should look like. The main takeaway? Open source software and open APIs give organizations the freedom to adjust their communications infrastructure to their specific needs and transition successfully to ChatOps.

Case studies will include how a leading Silicon Valley decacorn, a major U.S. federal agency, and two of the 10 largest investment banks in the world use ChatOps in their organizations.
