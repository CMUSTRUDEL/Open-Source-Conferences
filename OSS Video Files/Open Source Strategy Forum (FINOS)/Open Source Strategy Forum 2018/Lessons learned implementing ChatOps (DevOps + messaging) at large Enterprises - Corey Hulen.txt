Presentation: Lessons learned implementing ChatOps (DevOps + messaging) at large Enterprises

Email overload, distributed teams and excessive meetings have caused many organizations to move their DevOps teams to messaging platforms and thus adopt ChatOps workflows. With thousands of open source installs and hundreds of customer implementations, we have a few lessons to share on interesting DevOps workflows, how incidents can be effectively communicated across distributed teams and what messaging in secure and regulated environments should look like. The main takeaway? Open source software and open APIs give organizations the freedom to adjust their communications infrastructure to their specific needs and transition successfully to ChatOps.

Case studies will include how a leading Silicon Valley decacorn, a major U.S. federal agency, and two of the 10 largest investment banks in the world use ChatOps in their organizations.

[Music]

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,740
all right we ready to get started so

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,869
this talks about lessons learned

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,570
implementing chat ops DevOps post

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,130
messaging at large enterprises so my

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,189
name is Corey Yulin I'm co-founder and

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,170
CTO of matter most I'll talk a little

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:36,870
bit more about what matter most is in a

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:38,190
second what is chat ops so how many

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,730
people run chat ops today in their

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,980
organizations okay and maybe this would

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,809
be a good talks this is this this is

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,510
more aimed at sort of a beginners sort

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,010
of like how to but this is one of the

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,809
definitions of chat ups there's many of

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,270
them this is the one I like so chat ops

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,320
is a collaborative conversation centric

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,140
way of working that brings people

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,670
discussions BOTS tools and files into

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,890
one central location so that's all it

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,479
really is right it's nothing nothing

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,560
fancy it's more you'll hear me say it

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,820
it's more methodology than the

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,500
technology so that's kind of what it is

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,049
benefits the chat up so so why do it

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,299
right these are some of the benefits

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,159
that we see time and time again right it

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,470
shortens the feedback loop right faster

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,759
response time it probably jumps down to

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,530
this one is one of the most important

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,689
ones to see you like mean time to

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,939
restore drops dramatically we see this

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,009
time and time again customers who use

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,439
chat ops getting everyone in the same

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,979
channel getting that fare that shared

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,860
feedback loop is what really drops

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,750
response times it's a shared console or

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,759
command line so getting everyone in the

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,229
same channel it's a great experience of

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,020
seeing kind of what the history is

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,049
what's been going on in that channel it

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,549
captures the history right and sort of

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,960
all the required people in one place

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,670
right so this is a great way to bring

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,369
everyone together to be focusing on the

00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,640
problem right and sort of the last line

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,500
again

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,149
it's a methodology not a technology so

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,180
you'll hear there's a lot of different

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,039
viewpoints on what chat Ops is but but

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,179
for me it's more about the methodology

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,770
of technology it's about bringing all

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,000
these people together it's about having

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,230
that shared experience

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,659
it's about capture

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,400
his the history of what's going on so

00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,319
everyone kind of see what's going on in

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,930
a channel especially in channel based

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,599
communication so you'll kind of see this

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,750
as like a classic diagram of what Chad

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,090
Ops is so so I'll walk you through these

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,170
pieces and kind of describe the first

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,849
things you just have your team all the

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,790
way over here on the left right so this

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,680
is your sres your support your DevOps

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,810
your engineers right and they're

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,900
interacting with a messaging tool so in

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,360
this case it's matter most so matter

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,220
most is an open source messaging

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,390
platform for high trust organizations

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,739
there's a lot of other great messaging

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,510
platforms out there but you can kind of

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,950
plug in whichever one you want but but

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,620
this is us and basically what the key

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,069
here is is channel based communication

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,030
right communication where you have

00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,890
communication where it's focused on a

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,079
central topic around a central topic

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,790
right so you're interacting with this

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,140
messaging based application that

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,120
messaging based application is then

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,250
interacting typically with a bot so

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,319
that's the most classic world to chat

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,000
ops just yet described as box right it

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,650
can be a lot it can be a lot less than

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,299
bots and I'll kind of go through the I

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,919
call it like a six step process for

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,290
getting there but typically you'll see

00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,790
something like Hugh bot where you're

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,530
giving it sort of maybe natural language

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,660
queries it's bringing you back data and

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,280
you're sort of exploring your internal

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,840
systems that way and then you have

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,000
something like Hugh bot or a bot or

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,069
different infrastructure or different

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
sorry slash commands talking to your

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,359
infrastructure right so this is pulling

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,030
graphs out of Prometheus or graph on ax

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,530
pulling data out of you know my sequel

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,880
kubernetes variable yes or whatever you

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,220
use right so this is just your classic

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,560
infrastructure it's about surfacing that

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,870
information in your infrastructure in a

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,750
messaging tool that a lot of people have

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,489
access to you right so that's kind of

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,530
the idea you know and I even write down

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,629
here write reality you most are not this

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,599
sophisticated like even the simple steps

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:09,480
can give you can help you a long ways in

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:14,030
the chat ops world so this is great but

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,680
how do we get there right so step one

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,410
this is what we kind of recommend the

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,090
clients or customers right start small

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,820
do it manually for a bit right so that's

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,099
the first kind of classic one is are you

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,060
a chat based organization right yes and

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,100
not everyone is

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,169
but if you're not and get everyone in a

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,790
sort of a channel based sort of

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,730
messaging system that's kind of step one

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,919
right start beginning all the humans

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,310
into the channel right that's kind of

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,780
key channel based communication is key

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,280
to incident response right so you want

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,440
those channels that are focused on

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,240
topics they may be different topics

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,400
security performance infrastructure who

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,230
knows but you want those conversations

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,910
to happen around those topics so the key

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,300
is just getting your people there and

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,040
having those conversations right

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,919
remember it's a shared thing right think

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,240
of it like a cooperative or game um I

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,190
kind of like to think of it in terms of

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,360
your team has a lot of esoteric

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,950
knowledge right people know how to

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,139
answer questions or like hey I think I

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,700
know the answer this and getting them in

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,979
that sort of channel based communication

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,290
that's step one is just getting your

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,910
cooperative team playing together right

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,010
they're playing in that channel they're

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,440
seeing the history of what people have

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,210
done and exploring new ways to start

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,380
right so it captures the history and

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,479
that's that's a very valuable thing

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,680
right because somebody coming in can

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,760
join the channel or come in partway

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,590
through the conversation see all

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,419
previous steps the dev off engineer did

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,680
hey did you try this oh yeah I tried

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,680
that look here here's the results right

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,940
I always like to tell people don't be

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,610
afraid to over add people in the

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,650
beginning right it's better as long as

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,910
your people have clearance or security

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,950
whatever it is to see the information

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,390
like it's always better to over at it's

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,310
better to have more eyeballs because

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,530
people will self filter they'll like oh

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,640
this incident is not important to me I'm

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,840
gonna ignore it right it's not in a

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,760
component I control or care about

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,410
they'll add to the conversation if they

00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
can meaning ok I've seen that error

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,710
message before I think it might be this

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,820
right so that's just kind of step one

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,620
and like I said it's a very manual

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,870
process right just getting all your

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,630
people together in a single channel

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,350
right based around whatever incident

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,750
maybe so here's an example so here's an

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,550
example so I'm taking a lot of our

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,770
examples from our community server so

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,030
we're we're open source product so we

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,919
kind of showcase a lot of these

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,330
different examples in our product itself

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,970
is just community matter most calm

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,110
anybody can join it and kind of see the

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,120
different examples here these are all

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,450
real world examples some better than

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,700
others but here's an example of just a

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,440
manual process of you know cooperative

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,630
solving a problem right somebody says

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,230
hey you know screen so there's a

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,160
previous best

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,720
somebody just showed towards the

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,370
screenshot here this is a great way to

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,200
communicate but you can see one of my

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,550
teammates asking a community member like

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,220
hey the screenshot really doesn't help

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,960
can you attach the log for me as well or

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,250
a part of the log right and so that's

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,260
that's what he's doing here he's

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,340
attaching the log to the channel I think

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,510
this might be in a Help Wanted or

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,580
contributors channel where someone's

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,380
asking you for help but you can see it's

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,240
it's a lot more richly formatted

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,980
information as part of that channel and

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,740
please feel free to interrupt or ask

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,480
questions as I go through this so that's

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,630
just kind of step one right you're

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,340
getting people into a which messaging

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,620
system that allows you the flexibility

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,950
to format information and see it in a

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,060
way that's valuable to your team members

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,940
that's kind of what I described a step

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:28,230
one very manual just kind of you know do

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,240
it all based on humans step two you

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,010
automate the simple things so this is

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,100
where you start seeing the sort of chat

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,630
UPS world come into play right you don't

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,860
need to start with the uber powerful bot

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,850
everyone thinks this chat off so these

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,770
amazing you know these are main I mean

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,090
amazing you know human interface BOTS

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,320
that go off and do all this magical

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,650
stuff but it doesn't have to be that

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,480
right it can be just automate the simple

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,880
alerts piping them into a channel right

00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,350
we see this time and time again now the

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,640
other thing is to sort of start creating

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,470
specific channels for different alerts

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,770
right whether that be security

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,140
performance build systems or war rooms

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,120
right so it's about it's about making

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,060
sure you're getting the topics correct

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,550
and then piping data into those topics

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,740
right and you can get started just by

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,420
using simple web hooks right so you know

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,810
most messaging systems in this Web space

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,730
offer things like simple web web hooks

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,180
to get this stuff done so and then watch

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,340
your team cooperatively your spot like

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,810
you know how often does the left hand

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,520
not know what the right hands doing in

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,420
our organization right we see this all

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,400
the time in our community

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,260
I know large enterprises see this all

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,030
the time especially when you start

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,070
talking about things that are going on

00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,260
in your infrastructure half the team

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,520
gets an email alert the other half the

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,840
team who cause the alert doesn't

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,820
actually get it so we know what's going

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,530
on right so this is about bringing

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,330
everyone together sort of in that

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,980
central channel and so here's a good

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,980
example here's a real world example of

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,590
us my internal team

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,400
causing a problem with our corporate

00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,920
LDAP server so we get an alert in one of

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,720
our channels right and one of our team

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,830
members is there and you know we're in

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
all timezone so we have team members

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,940
around the world at different times

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,070
joining and the first thing he does is

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,770
he noticed is it like oh this is related

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,060
LDAP I should you know message Martin to

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,100
see if he's aware of this right

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,320
Martin's not actually in this channel so

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,660
he quickly gets added to the channel and

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,650
then you can say like oh yeah I'm doing

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,840
a lot of requests right now so he's

00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,880
actually running a load test against one

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,290
of our corporate LDAP systems right so

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,600
this is this a very simple web hook

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,760
where an alert gets posted into a

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,020
channel you have the certain number of

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,660
team members and they're monitoring the

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,910
channel but can easily go grab other

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,040
team members and bring them in right so

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,390
maybe the very simple form of chat

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,550
people may not call this chat off I do

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,580
but it's just the very simplest form of

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,110
you haven't Alert let's get the right

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,940
people in the room to respond to that

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,970
alert and see and let's see what's going

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,710
on so a very simple example but a but a

00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:01,730
very sort of necessary step in them in

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:03,030
the process any questions or no okay

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,860
step two

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:09,270
so automate the harder things right you

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,050
can start by adding advanced slash

00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:15,720
commands or alerting hooks you can bring

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,090
in richer data and I'll kind of go

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,010
through examples here so what I mean by

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,690
harder things things that are more than

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,790
screenshots right it's always better to

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,220
start adding more and more rich data so

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,570
you start off with a very manual process

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,570
you start off with some alerts and web

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,580
hooks some very simple things and then

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,200
you start very quickly wanting your your

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,240
users start very quickly wanting more

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,530
right so you start adding you know more

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,050
than screenshots you start adding things

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,630
like markdown tables file attachments

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,100
for logs write markdown formatting so

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,140
there's a whole slew of these different

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,780
types of things but it's about getting

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,480
the the users who don't necessarily have

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,970
like a great example is how many times

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,680
you have your DevOps or us or Eastside

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,530
have access to a bunch of metrics that

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,300
your engineers don't write they're just

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,560
not in they're not in the right emails

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,060
they're not in the right systems to

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,840
actually easily bring that information

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,950
back right

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,260
so it's about bringing that information

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,660
out for them into a pump into a semi

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,670
public space and giving them a rich

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,290
version of it right so I'll walk through

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,300
a couple different examples so here's an

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:20,120
example of a load test result right so

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,130
somebody issued a slash command that

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,250
slash man actually went off into our CI

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,900
CD pipeline spun up a load test because

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,730
someone requested a load test all from

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,930
within it all from within chat right

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,060
it's not like they're in some

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,830
super-secret system they just went you

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,560
know slash mater build load test blah

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,020
blah blah right and it runs off our CI

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,550
CD pipeline gets kicked off it starts

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,020
running a particular load test it starts

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,510
running this particular load test it may

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,910
take 5 10 15 minutes to run and at the

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,350
at the end of that load test the results

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,910
get posted back into the channel right

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,410
and so here's just an example of sort of

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,240
you know richly 40 Manning the

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,220
information so it's easy for users to

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,040
see right so this is kind of taking it

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,780
to the next step right start leveraging

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,520
start leveraging the tools in your chat

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,540
system that allow you to really quickly

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,610
disseminate information to your team

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,490
right so that's one example of sort of

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,380
rich markdown being rendered here's an

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,880
example of rich message a log being

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,560
attached right so this is a bit more

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,300
more manual but we do have automated

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
systems that do this as well so here's

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,580
an example where someone created a bug

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,530
it's actually from the JIRA bot and it

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,030
kind of links to JIRA but it kind of

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,050
explains some of the repo steps but it's

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,630
missing some key pieces of information

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,580
right like the logs for that so here's

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,100
an example of me attaching the Ingenix

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,200
logs right and it's actually it's

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,610
actually a text file but when you when

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,900
you click it you could just see the logs

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,280
right there in place so you can start

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,110
scrolling through and searching for it

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,990
so here's a great example where you're

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,940
having an incident or a bug you're

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,590
having a team discussing it and you just

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,020
want more information around that right

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,820
more rich information remember the more

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,730
rich information you can bring into this

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,650
experience the more your your people

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,020
will use this experience more they will

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,030
depend on it and you're also talking

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,290
about largely disseminating this

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,060
information to a big group of people

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,770
right here's an example attaching a very

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,110
specific thing engine engine X logs

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,540
right but you know some members of my

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,040
team have a lot of amazing you know in

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,150
genetics experience more way more than I

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
do right and they'll be able to look at

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,040
these

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,360
and quickly identify like hey oh hey

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:39,800
this is where I think the problem is

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:42,290
right no I'm not and what would we meet

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,560
you be able to achieve we're doing an

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,079
FTC free is to say anybody who could

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,760
then say actually I can show a lot of

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,410
you are and then we can clicked instead

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,149
of bringing up your viewer they could

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,329
bring up their super duper viewer and

00:13:53,149 --> 00:14:02,120
this kind of auto discovery of services

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:03,589
to prevent a particular user yeah we

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,139
should talk and I'll show something in

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:11,230
step five that maybe will pique your

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:14,240
interests any other questions about this

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,550
no okay

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,519
steps three so this is start automating

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,470
command and control right so start off

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,480
with simple thing simple outgoing

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,010
webhooks is simple slash commands right

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,480
and the key here is you automate things

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,980
that you find your teammates constantly

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,050
bugging your DevOps team to go give them

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,970
reports for or do right everyone in

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,130
organization knows this some email gets

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,389
sent off into some random or chat

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,639
message gets sent off into some random

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:42,380
ether asking somebody like hey can you

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,930
give me this report and then three days

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,519
later right or this the logs for this

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,510
right if it's critically she'll come

00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,220
back faster hopefully but if it's

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,779
non-critical you know three days later

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,779
you finally get someone responding to it

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:56,029
right so this is about taking simple

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:58,579
things like slash commands automating it

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,050
and letting your users Souths provision

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,120
right so this is kind of like the next

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,310
step so this that's the key here right

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,380
allow South reasoning by most anyone or

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,959
most anyone who has access to that kind

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,910
of data right so they can go query the

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,250
system through that through this common

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,720
messaging interface right and that's

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,819
kind of the one Keys everyone in the

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,260
same channel again everyone seeing the

00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,120
command and control and what's cool

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,010
about this is someone issuing the

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,540
command and control or let's say pulling

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,910
back a report like just bringing back

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,170
analytics is the first step right other

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,930
people will get to see that to you right

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,250
they'll go in and they'll see me what

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,080
queries I'm running and what

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,440
what data I'm trying to get at right and

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,460
then they will either paste tell me like

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,020
hey you should be running this query

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,950
instead it's probably better right or

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,290
they'll come in and do it themselves

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,790
right and then the key here is you know

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,860
you trust the automation to keep them on

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,570
the rails right they shouldn't be able

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,730
to screw this up right you have a very

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,100
narrow sort of Flash command interface

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,570
that's very robust and item potent right

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,920
and it just it can run the same command

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,270
it can not really affect your

00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,040
infrastructure much it brings back the

00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,600
data into the channel right and you're

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,820
allowing all your people just to see

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,080
this and have this happen and the cool

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,460
interesting thing about this when you

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,830
start doing this is you'll start seeing

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,570
non-developers run these commands right

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,650
you'll you'll start yo see your

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,300
developers in running through these

00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,940
commands then you know I say non

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,880
developers like I mean people more like

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,440
you know first tier support or maybe QA

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,850
person right who's not necessarily very

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,320
familiar with what's going on but they

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,490
know enough like hey they're gonna

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,840
eventually want this information or I

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,460
know if I see this era man I think I've

00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,470
seen this before let me run this command

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,490
right so now you're really empowering

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,650
your organization right you're

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,870
empowering people who would have never

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,940
done this before to self discover this

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,470
information right and that that's one of

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,890
the keys right you're starting to grow

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,140
these command and control hooks outside

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,210
that core nucleus of people who you know

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,589
quote know what they're doing even

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,060
though half the time we don't know what

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,710
we're doing right and the key there is

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,970
just trust in the automation and

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,490
trusting the automation to keep them on

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,680
the rails right so some examples of

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,940
these things that could be very complex

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,790
or very easy depending on your

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,430
environment that we we use this step for

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,740
is we'll set up automated testing or ad

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,900
hoc testing so if you want to if a QA

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,189
person wants a server they can go in and

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,600
issue a slash command that actually

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,280
provisions the server sets it all up

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,250
correctly they can even tell like my

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,900
sequel versus Postgres whatever it is

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,180
it'll go it'll queue the server it'll

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,949
fire it up it'll post back in a channel

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,990
like hey here's an axis here's access to

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,520
your test server set up load testing

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,960
environments you saw an example earlier

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,310
of us doing this or query details right

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
querying details on analytic system

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,340
that's always interesting right most

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,420
people want to get in there they and

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,770
then they have an incident or something

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,260
going on they want to start pulling out

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,890
information and piping that into the

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,960
channel and that's kind of key and and

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,360
then last you know you start automating

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,130
deployments to production right and and

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,039
why would you do this I think one of the

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,570
keys is you know it's nice to see

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,850
history of what went wrong right when

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,649
someone's issuing slash commands that

00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,600
then you'll go out and talk to Jenkins

00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:01,549
or one of your CI CD pipelines right you

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,320
have a very rich history of what that

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,090
person was doing right you had this

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,380
shared deploy experience where anyone

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,630
can kind of come in and troubleshoot

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,740
very quickly like hey what's the problem

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:14,659
with this white and this is a ploy

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,679
correctly that's step three so it's a

00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,450
really quick I'll show some really quick

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,279
examples we have something called mater

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,890
build it actually cuts our release

00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,799
builds so you can kind of see here he's

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:28,070
issuing a slash command to cut the build

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,630
it echoes back saying like okay I'm I'm

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,039
gonna immediately echo back in the

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,460
channel like yes I'm cutting the build

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
for you

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,610
it actually posts in the other channel

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,130
that's what this message is down here

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,049
like hey you know Carlos is starting a

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,720
build or whatever or you know mater

00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:44,539
build is starting a build or whatever it

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,840
goes off we go into our you know our si

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,580
CIC pipeline the build starts running it

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,309
let's say completes in 20 minutes and

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,390
assuming a successful build so here's an

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,669
example of us building a release

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,140
candidate the information for that

00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,580
release candidate is actually echo back

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,890
into the channel for everyone to see

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,230
right so our testers can go start seeing

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,450
it a bunch of our systems I will

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,760
actually have already have this this

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,649
version installed right but here's

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,720
here's sort of the release details for

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,190
that RC Canada you know here's the build

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,330
links here's the hashes if you want to

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,130
go fooling around with it install it

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,200
yourself here's a testing server that's

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,669
already set up with it all that kind of

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,529
information so you can kind of see from

00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,620
a very simple standpoint of being able

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:25,970
to cut a build a release build and get

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,830
it to a point where the entire team

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:32,659
quickly knows what's going on so here's

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,120
here's a example of our slash command

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:36,289
here's the help for it if you notice you

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,710
can do a whole bunch of other staffing

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,970
and it can cut builds it can do some it

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,559
helped you with the branching for things

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,779
like our portal translations it can do

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,750
load tests you can actually merge

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:50,210
branches you can run certain types of

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,620
jobs you can see the configuration of

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,559
the build system here you can even see

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,900
configuration of our individual servers

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,980
and so it's always it's and

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,150
is kind of the next step right you're

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,190
talking about building slashed commands

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,800
and slash commands that have a lot of

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,570
information so people can discover what

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,890
these things do you right and the key is

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,440
making sure these slash commands are

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,540
kind of bulletproof or you know in the

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,560
sense that if you if you run it and you

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,610
run it improperly you don't have to

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,960
worry about it screwing up your

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:21,480
infrastructure and so this leads us to

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,720
the sort of the next step right and this

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,160
is where you see this is where you see

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,960
the bots started coming into place so

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,820
you're taking all that previous steps

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,030
right going from the manual to the

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,600
simple alerts to the slash commands and

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,680
now you're really starting to talk about

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,690
turning in it more into a BA style

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,830
interface right really a letting it go

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,870
out to the masses

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,910
and allowing them to query this because

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,170
who can remember the cryptic slash

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,200
command without looking at the healthy I

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,880
can't even do it right so this is about

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,860
allowing your bots to sort of take over

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
this infrastructure and give you

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,910
interesting information about it right

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,710
so you take all the previous steps and

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:02,040
you start converting them into a more

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,570
human interface so that that's kind of

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,250
key yeah I always like to tell people

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,710
you know give your bot some character

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,470
make it fun right make it Angry make it

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,510
overly happy the key here is to humanize

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,940
it for your audience right and part of

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,150
that humanization or that that that

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,500
character that your bot has it draws

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,720
people when they want to use it one

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,770
experience right and it gives you

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,450
something to blame in the end right now

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,460
the angry bot did it not me right so

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,180
it's a great way to help you blame your

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,950
infrastructure instead of blaming people

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,520
and there's a lot of great existing bot

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,720
interfaces out there so Hugh bots are

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,250
good example here people talk a lot

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,460
about it already has a bunch of plugins

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,290
that are able to connect to and build

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,520
different things Hugh BOTS a good

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,710
example for connecting things like

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,210
Jenkins you know showing servers logs

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,700
for various test servers showing graph

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,740
on reports right a rich human interface

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:58,770
into those existing systems you may have

00:21:52,740 --> 00:22:01,170
right so there's a very simple of a Hugh

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,630
BA we don't have a whole lot that we can

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,950
show and better worth showing but you

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,690
know here's just me saying hey Hugh bot

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,090
let's ship it it's very human interface

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:11,250
it comes back with you know the classic

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,840
ship it squirrel you

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,130
I mean you've seen people who have Hugh

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,470
bot do a lot of really interesting stuff

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,640
and this is what you want you want to

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,970
start getting to as a larger

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,560
organization and this kind of brings me

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,700
to step five I call this an optional

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,820
step so this might be something

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:30,840
interesting and this is where you start

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,640
building rich plugins and boz so you

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,830
know utilizing a rich plugin framework

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,030
to build deep integration with it so

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,400
this is something that matter most

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:41,130
supports other chat systems may or may

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,240
not support this but it's something when

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,230
you start talking about wanting to

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,850
really leverage very specific

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,020
applications in your infrastructure part

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,150
of that is about embedding those

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,370
applications in something like chat

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,750
where your users sit right or vice versa

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,060
right embeddings chat in those

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,010
applications so to me this is kind one

00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,510
of those interesting steps where you

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,190
start building really into integrations

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,130
right you can do both fun and embackment

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,510
plugins in matter most you can even

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,010
intercept messages before they're in

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,750
turn of the chat system and you can also

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,190
intercept them afterwards right so you

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,280
can think of really unique cases that

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,410
you can do with your BOTS and your

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,910
plugins and so I'll kind of show the

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,500
ones that we have running in our system

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:23,310
so we have a github integration in our

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,540
system and if you notice it's kind of

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,970
really interesting there's actually this

00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,190
github bot right here this is actually

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:33,000
my account it's telling me I have unone

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:34,410
unread message in this pull request so

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,970
it'll notify me when something changes

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,860
in good hub and it tells me like hey

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,150
Cory you need to go look at this now one

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,470
of the other cool things here is you can

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,470
see this really rich integration right

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,030
here so this is the actual github plugin

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,920
that we produce actually taking control

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,680
of the left-hand side right so it's

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,180
taking control of that little team

00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,350
sidebar widget so I'm not sure you know

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,000
people are familiar with you know other

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,350
chat apps like slack whatever but you

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,330
can imagine being able to take control

00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,650
over pieces of the UI right and this is

00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,490
really starts really really interesting

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,430
right because it gives me all these

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,840
other things I can do in github I can

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,660
see my open pull requests which I have

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,770
none my open Forks

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,450
Okin open items my unread messages stuff

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,270
like that so it's a very rich

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,800
integration with my chat app right so so

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:21,030
that that's one example what I mean by

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,410
rich integration here's another one

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,630
where it's is kind of the same thing so

00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,690
this is actually a popover

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,250
when I click on aliases name this is

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,259
actually a pop-up this is another place

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,029
we allow you to do a plugin and if you

00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,769
notice it actually LinkedIn it was smart

00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,600
up to link in his github profile right

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:38,880
so from right there I can kind of find a

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,600
user I can find his profile I can do

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,659
interesting stuff like that and probably

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,759
the last one is is you can actually take

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,779
control of the entire center pane so

00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,870
this is kind of maybe more to your

00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,250
example of like logs or whatever where

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,500
you know here's some something being

00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,029
discussed I can immediately come in here

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,259
and say create JIRA issue right so I

00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:03,529
added this I added this this action

00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,120
button there right to the message and

00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:09,269
when I click it I can get a very rich

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,919
pop-up right so a rich pop-up of

00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:12,840
creating that ticket and assistant right

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,110
so this is this is about bridging

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,059
between where BOTS or human interface

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,000
can get you so far and taking you

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,919
something more multimodal where you know

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,899
having that sort of rich deep

00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,460
integration with exterior at so it could

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,620
apps you can even open up windows and

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,480
two other things takes you so much

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,710
further right so you're actually still

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,269
in matter most here but you're actually

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,350
going to end up creating a ticket into

00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,850
your and it was smart enough to actually

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,590
copy over the entire threaded

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,620
conversation for this ticket here right

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:43,019
so I can really quickly in a rich style

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,490
interface create a ticket into here and

00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,049
this is this is where we see customers

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,240
being very successful when they start

00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,860
taking a lot of their their sort of

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,779
discovery and command and control of the

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,600
bots and integrating that with really

00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,580
rich integrations into their chat system

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,169
right keeping everyone in the same place

00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,779
because what's kind of cool about this

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:02,129
is after I finish creating the ticket

00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:03,389
the person who posts that message will

00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:05,399
see the message right in line right

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:08,399
Corie created this ticket Enduro to

00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:10,860
track this issue right so that's

00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:15,240
something that becomes super interesting

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:17,940
and then sort of step six is what I call

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,860
Nirvana so this is BOTS talking to BOTS

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,409
this is sort of your BOTS Nirvana in the

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,879
end we see some of our customers

00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:25,649
generating more than 50% of their

00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:27,120
traffic from bots so we see some

00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:29,909
customers doing more than a million

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,559
messages a day and that means 500,000 of

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:33,360
those messages are actually just coming

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,129
from BOTS in their infrastructure it's a

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,470
very amazing number it's a very cool

00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:39,150
thing to see and so

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,130
what are they doing this minibars right

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,270
they do a lot of different things but

00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,820
some of the funnest ones to talk about

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,700
are things like some customers have a

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,890
war room right and the war room during

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,350
an outage has so many messages going by

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:55,110
more than 20 a second a human cannot

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,640
actually read the war room right and

00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,380
it's kind of funny at that point it's I

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,090
describe it as reading the matrix right

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,650
you just all these messages going by I'm

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,950
like that's great that doesn't give me

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,840
any value right where the value is is

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,360
some of these customers actually have

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,190
BOTS watching that war room right and

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,960
it's almost like an app backplane right

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,700
at that point they have bots that are

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,620
watching that war room pulling out

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,690
certain messages putting them in the

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,400
channels where humans can interact with

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,460
those messages in that data right and

00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,380
then they have BOTS that are pushing

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,299
those messages back into channels back

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,770
into that war room channel right so at

00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,630
that point it's acting almost like a

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,190
message bus right and you've kind of

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,320
reached this bot nirvana where it's

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,780
where you know bathroom was talking to

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,220
BOTS and lots of respects and that's

00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,020
where you get into a really interesting

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,429
infrastructure and we can kind of go

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,350
into more detail from here but you start

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,890
talking about lots having the ability to

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,809
self-heal

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,580
or recognize certain problems because

00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:50,190
remember most these large enterprises

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,169
are very decentralized microservices

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,460
organizations right left hand doesn't

00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,809
know what the right hand is doing or

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,549
this micro service doesn't really know

00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,590
what this this other micro service is

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,840
doing right so there's a there's a

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,210
common sort of message bus for these

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,490
micro services to talk together right

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,530
and you know using a channel of matter

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,150
most to do this you know or in a chat

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,970
based application and the key there is

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:15,450
you have humans and BOTS sort of talking

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,770
in human you know human style talk right

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,270
and that's what's key because you're

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,190
pulling those messages out your

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,600
augmenting it right it's semi structured

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,710
data you're augmenting it with human

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,490
facts and then you're putting those

00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:29,370
messages back in so that's always a fun

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,250
one to talk about an NC I think we might

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,250
end a little early which might be good

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,250
questions

00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,470
yeah so there is so we actually have

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,270
that so if you actually go into our

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,760
community server today and you try to do

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,320
matter most cut build obviously you

00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,700
don't want 3000 people in our community

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,250
to be able to cut a release build right

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,680
so we actually have permissions based on

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:07,980
different things such as slash commands

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,240
and so in our system you can so those

00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,070
some of those commands are available to

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,600
a lot of people like I think almost

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,430
anyone can actually run a load test in

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,740
our system any community member of the

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,140
3,000 people can just go slash load test

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,610
matter build arm a terminus right but

00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,320
for things like cutting a release build

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,760
only certain people we give permissions

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,780
to and it'll actually echo back and tell

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:53,490
you sorry you don't have the proper

00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:55,200
permissions go talk to bla bla bla ya

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,900
know so exactly that right being able to

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,460
to echo back and tell us and know what

00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,380
the person is doing so we allow you to

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,420
post back ephemeral mas messages so you

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,730
can actually intercept that message and

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,930
inst and make a decision before it goes

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,220
into the system so it can go into a

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,630
system record in the system stored

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,040
permanently whatever forever for all

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,200
attorney until you delete it right or

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,580
you can actually say hey I'm gonna

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,230
reject this message but you can reject

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,460
it in several way so you can reject it

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,750
back with an ephemeral message so you

00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,640
can actually give the user guy and it's

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,650
like sorry you actually inputted that

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,910
flash command incorrectly you know the

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,530
second parameter should have something

00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,630
to do is bla bla bla or whatever right

00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,430
so we allow you to do that as well now

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,900
you to intercept it after the message

00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,000
and so you run into all these really

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,410
interesting use cases where you want to

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,360
read format messages and we see this all

00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,690
the time right we have we see this all

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,190
the time

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,430
and we see this as real-world use cases

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:43,620
where human users input data that's semi

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,960
structured and the pre message hook

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,400
actually understands that Digga data so

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,440
think of it like detecting a stock

00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,820
ticker an IP address right and then it

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,860
does a whole bunch of magical linking

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,210
after the fact so you get a very rich

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,860
representation and we see this all the

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,390
time in InfoSec security is a great

00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,190
example right oh we're getting an issue

00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,090
from this IP address right or this

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,919
domain right and you

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,549
want to link it you want to Auto create

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,380
a link into your very rich you know

00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:08,429
security analysis tool around that IP

00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,480
address right that's actually a

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,370
real-world use case that we see

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,690
something like that quite a bit and so

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,179
the ability to intercept that message

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,799
before is really interesting and think

00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,900
of it in terms of things like passwords

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,299
or security keys or social security

00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,880
numbers right hey if it if it begins

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,919
with you know private key let's maybe

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,450
reject that message from the server

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,159
right just because we don't want it to

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,419
be a system of record for all time right

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,090
so there's a lot of things we find

00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,649
customers doing like that as well right

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,730
which is hey you can to take so you know

00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,230
things that look like social security

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,029
number don't let it go into the chat

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,799
right and same thing for other chat BOTS

00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:42,929
right when you have a chat bot that's

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,450
just blindly posting stuff in you can

00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:47,159
have another plug-in that's reading that

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,870
chat bot and before it goes in the

00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,580
system a record is reformatting it right

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,370
so it knows that even though this is

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,440
coming from a very rich security

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,299
analytics tool you may not want to show

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,669
that all that information to all of your

00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:02,010
users right so it reformats the message

00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:08,630
into something that's more general

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:08,630
audience available any other questions

00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:26,220
yeah that's a good one

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,710
we see that we see that quite a bit one

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,809
of the things that we do is like take

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,850
JIRA for example our actual JIRA plug-in

00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:35,549
one will try to keep the messages in

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:40,110
sync so if you post to that input if you

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:41,760
post in that let's say JIRA coming on

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,230
the JIRA ticket it'll actually post it

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,690
back in the channel as part of the

00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,940
thread so with a lot of our bots or

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,500
plugins we strive for a sort of two-way

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,779
communication to keep those things in

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,640
sync or at least a very quick access

00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,840
right so it's like hey new information

00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,909
was entered go here to see it or

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,799
whatever so we do see that some of the

00:32:56,909 --> 00:33:01,169
some of the bots are plugins do it a lot

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,370
better than others but that is an area

00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,440
we're going towards is the ability to

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,610
sort of that that bi-directional

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,289
communication because that's the reality

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,700
of it right how many people like we even

00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:10,440
see this in our organization right how

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,970
many you know not augury developer has

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,560
access to Zendesk to see the actual

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,660
customer support ticket right

00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,280
that's a huge pain right I have a very

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,600
expensive DevOps resource who's looking

00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,300
at the issue but he doesn't have access

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,880
to all information right or same thing

00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:27,390
with maturer right we have a community

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,270
member who who who is helping you know

00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:32,670
troubleshoot a bug and he wants access

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,560
to all the information in JIRA right so

00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,490
we see that quite a bit and so a lot of

00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,380
times we're trying to build these

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:58,410
bi-directional plugins or BOTS other

00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:59,460
questions yes so that's exactly what a

00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,290
few but if there's a lot of them out

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,210
there you can google them Hugh BOTS

00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,130
probably the one that I see the most but

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,530
but it's it's kind of language agnostic

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,790
kind of platform agnostic it works with

00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,480
a bunch of different chat platforms it

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,580
works with a bunch of different

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,200
languages it already has a bunch of sort

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,730
of back-end integrations it already

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,050
knows how to control things like JIRA

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,060
and stuff like that so that that's

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,169
probably the best starting point but

00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,190
there's a lot of them out there so

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:41,040
there's a lot of good ones out there as

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:43,200
well that's that that's the nice aspect

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,880
of dude so that that's one of the big

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,530
reasons for doing this in a ba style

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,440
interface right that human style

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,120
conversation is what is what allows you

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,700
to sort of create that loose coupling

00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,100
right and that's a great first step like

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,570
like yeah that's a great first step what

00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,070
we find is sort of that second step

00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:01,290
where you want really rich integrations

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,520
right and that because you want those

00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,840
people to have access to more

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,580
information at some point but yeah it's

00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,040
it's a great it that human language

00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,750
interface is a great lowest common

00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:16,800
denominator and you get very powerful

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:17,910
you can do a lot other questions no all

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,930
right I think we're about perfect on

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,840
time

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,750
Thanks Thanks

00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,239
[Applause]
