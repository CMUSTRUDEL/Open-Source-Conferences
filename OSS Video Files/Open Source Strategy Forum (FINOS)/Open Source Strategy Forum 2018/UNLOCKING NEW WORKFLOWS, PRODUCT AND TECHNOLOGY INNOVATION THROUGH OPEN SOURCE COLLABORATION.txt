Title: UNLOCKING NEW WORKFLOWS, PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION THROUGH OPEN SOURCE COLLABORATION

Explore and hear about the latest open source contributions from J.P. Morgan that are enabling new workflows, industry collaboration and innovation across the digital landscape.
 
The latest contributions include the enterprise Click to Call (C2C) feature that is driving new ways to extend the user experience on collaboration platforms such as Symphony, using the power of APIs. We are also excited to be contributing a new data visualization engine, called Perspective that will provide an embedded framework enabling innovation in real time analytics while fostering active contributions across the FINOS community. It will showcase how open source collaboration on topics including data visualization will benefit and accelerate ideas across real time analytics, insights and intelligence.

[Music]

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,549
morning everyone thanks to a government

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,260
hold for NOS tac-2 million as you have

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,150
such great that i think is great to see

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,130
of violence a lot of familiar places in

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,560
the audience i think what we wanted to

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,090
touch upon today was we appreciate the

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,590
opportunity can present and talk about

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,570
some of our contributions and we want to

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,550
talk about some of the recent education

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,579
who made and you know across their very

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,410
important teams the the session of my

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,910
the type of my session that we're

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,510
talking about today is really around

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,219
unlocking new workflows and product

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,899
technology innovation for open source

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,649
collaboration so g de Mauban

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,590
participates and a few active streams

00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:52,199
from the symphony screening through to

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,090
the FDC 3 and the financial objects has

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,770
recently also announced the the

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,520
contribution of our perspective which is

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,620
a new rule time data visualization and

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,910
and credit to to Jim Adams and Neil

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,030
singer is in the audience

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,369
somewhat it was also presenting up in GA

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,860
s conference yesterday so give give a

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,900
demo of that but whatever I'm kind of

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,490
start with this is why open source I

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
mean gives us the opportunity to tap

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,259
into exactly what gap touched on the

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,710
expanding tongue you know across the

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,659
industry to help us hone in on new ideas

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,460
and I can't work close it's given us a

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,740
new perspective in terms of use cases

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,460
and where we have opportunity to cut the

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,610
kind of connector internally also takes

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,320
on a workplace it's also given the

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,420
stocks you really kind of think about

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,530
our architecture and in our names of

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,290
modular fashion and Jim who's our DP own

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,880
board member theroths he's really kind

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,380
of a vertical advocating across the

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,850
organization I think gives us a great

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,360
opportunity to collaborate with industry

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,649
and with our Philip afterlife and us

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,890
members to really kind of iterate that

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,380
process it's given us an ability to

00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,600
print products faster will also connect

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,219
across industry work clothes something

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
with that wine we wanted to kind of keep

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,479
it short we want to kind of focus on a

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,210
few of the recent contributions one of

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,800
them is

00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:16,600
or petition that we made recently so I

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
guess what you see on the screen that

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,170
the thinking time this is we've rolled

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
out Cynthia across our organization so

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,120
it's run up to about hundred twenty five

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
thousand users I guess one of the one of

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,040
the key benefits of poverty Symphony is

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,260
as a platform they have open source

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,820
components API is has given us the

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,940
opportunity can't think about how we

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,280
extend over experience so you know from

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,870
chap and collaboration it's it's helped

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,270
us across various teams to think about

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,370
how we connect to each other workplace

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,910
across the organization so what you see

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,130
on the screen is really us beyond the

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,770
extend that client experience further

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,900
so we've constantly clicked a court

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,390
which is really a feature that we built

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,630
off the symphony extensions API and

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,640
we've conscient back in the neighbors to

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,890
do that a practical level it's really

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,260
every time you hover over in this

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,240
instance Jim with in Sydney you see a

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,430
new feature which is forward and in

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,650
Kyushu he's in a quick way to integrate

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,500
into your enterprise telephony and you

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,230
guys so all son you've really taken the

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,860
context of conversing with the news on

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,570
Sydney

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,090
we often click and call them directly

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,340
into a voice collaboration and that's

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,190
kind of learning for us the evolution

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,380
for video conferencing carries as well

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,300
but I think the opportunity is really

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,970
around the feedback that it's given us

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,070
the opportunity its array maybe code

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,460
better and also content back to you

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,570
because it helps us drive engagement

00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,450
with the rest of the community and helps

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,860
us come foster build that overall

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,590
interaction across him here so we've had

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,530
all our positive feedback I think what

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,120
we've seen is really the increase in in

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,430
activities specifically through the

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,340
hover hover over card we see come a

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,690
five-fold increase in terms of usage as

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,610
we've kind of added it and click the

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,110
port so we want to kind of make that

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,520
content back into the community to

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,650
really kind of help drive that overall

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,170
engagement as I said it's a common

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,150
component so to really we're open to new

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,550
ideas how we can kind of make that a

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,090
better kind of tie that back into our

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,090
market

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,390
so with that in mind I think from our

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,820
from our first contra contribution was

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,490
really set into the second case which is

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,770
really was announced yesterday around

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,710
the launch of the perspective which is a

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,200
common component that's used actively a

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,300
cross-shaped morning and it ties into

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,920
our thena risk management system but

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,560
also independently yes it has an app

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,170
that's used by our internal teams most

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,200
outperform researchers so it's it's its

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,750
product and a real-time visualization

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,090
engine that's answering the rigor of the

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,850
SPLC it's gone through that real user

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,260
feedback internally and also external I

00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,120
think we've had a lot of valuable

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,490
feedback times where we can't take it

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,420
and really what it enables us to do is

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,580
really hone in on the common aspects of

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,340
the of the visualization that we'll see

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,870
later on in terms of the demo the

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,020
different aspects of working for them

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,200
with the proliferation of debt he 'tried

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,230
a real time tick data bat uploads I

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,360
think there is a there is a huge demand

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,450
in terms of how we optimize the

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,890
visualization of what we finding is not

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,350
just from internally across the industry

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,990
there's a later model how we could

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:38,840
improve that to make easier to surface

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:45,080
visual insights so this is now available

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:47,000
through finis and but it could carve the

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,390
architecture as well to my earlier point

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,100
I think Neal was a touched on this J s

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,720
conference Tuesday it gives us the

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,950
ability kind of connected to Jake more

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:00,230
platforms various analytics modules

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,990
real-time data feeds and also external

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,120
data sources saying really aggregate all

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,090
that together and visualize that in a

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
you know in a rapid manner it helps the

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,900
engineering teams make quicker decisions

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,200
and also helps our plan researchers and

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,850
ultimately our front office to really

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,180
make that decision quickly be able to

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,210
serve our clients but also it gives us

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,590
the ability to deploy analytics

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,540
components and apps across

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,110
source frameworks in a compatible way

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,850
and then in terms of the views gives us

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,430
the ability to combine different views

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:40,380
of different data sets so without mine

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,780
I'll dump quickly into the demo and then

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:48,050
happy to cover any questions we've got

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,050
to and nil the rooms well and

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:23,810
within quite adding some facts about

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,810
nature of levels

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,509
yes so the ability can't pivot filter so

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:45,560
combine different date setting right now

00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:47,419
which we talked about everything

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,910
important the performance scale village

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,979
is a big element with the vast amount of

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,810
data sets its ability kind of connect

00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:58,780
those data sets together in a logical

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,780
manner usually value across

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,450
they must've wanted to compare different

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,340
open source records as well so use cases

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,230
totally yes it runs on thinner to

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,850
several compartment but now let's in the

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,270
open source system option is to write

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,970
with your browser with different

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,620
annotations as well you can see this

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:28,400
example within the context of two purple

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,600
ladders plug-in and giving you the

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,580
ability come driving real-time

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,560
interaction and normal actions so it

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,840
starts back to the ability to connect

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,130
kind of water flows together but the

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:47,060
starting point is you know from a

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:52,000
visualization excellent

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,000
I want to get brief any questions

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:21,399
yes so we definitely have more confusion

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,149
this is definitely the first seed

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,829
contribution into the daily

00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,959
visualization program we're definitely

00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:29,529
looking for more contributions I think

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,050
this is really a catalyst to drive that

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,240
as well as iterating and getting the

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:39,339
best breathe out ideas across across the

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,339
thinnest members but also wiring issues

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,490
hi

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,680
so perspective is of JP Morgan project

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,300
isn't currently managed by a community

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,839
who loves how to take an organism

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,620
compute now we've got a few existing

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,079
quantities

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,620
out our JP Morgan so it's exactly being

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:02,600
integrated or any take Morgan and also

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,910
some our tech partners as well so it's

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,839
already I'm open and I think it's also

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,149
evolved for that duration so what we aim

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,990
to do is really kind of synchronize that

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,990
directly to Phillips

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,329
don't take them so that's kind of a

00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:35,610
general answer for any project

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:39,689
contribute to the foundation so I just

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:49,049
give it to you so Adam lawyer

00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:54,239
just in case the definition does not

00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:58,799
require any transfer of copyright to us

00:10:54,239 --> 00:11:01,319
what we ask is a license to publish the

00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,989
code under an outbound license which is

00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:05,489
Apache so the code is licensed under

00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:08,660
Apache for anyone

00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:11,040
downstream can use it but the original

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,670
intellectual property is left with a

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,439
contributor that means that this kind of

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,779
the model that we have accommodation out

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:21,089
there uses we have a CCNA contributor

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,249
life experiment that is very similar to

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,189
the Apache one of the Linux Foundation

00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:30,569
for example but it's really making sure

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:32,939
that we don't set too high of a bar in

00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,049
terms of translating copyrights leaving

00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:36,509
something right to give it you know

00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:38,279
contributor why else the whole community

00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:41,699
can work on the actual code other than

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:48,329
our party lines that is personal family

00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:59,249
as well as no all right does that answer

00:11:48,329 --> 00:12:01,319
your question I still was interested do

00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:02,879
you see that more software going that

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:10,739
direction how do you think that that

00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:13,100
combined with contested I'm lost the old

00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,100
stuff up

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,570
Seussville so you gave women some music

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,420
great technology we study experimenting

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,700
with it early last year we see it's a

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,620
great way of a celebrity host a lot of a

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,740
legacy tech for being built instantly

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,110
and actually brain magnet modern way in

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,339
the browser and also from a performance

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,040
point of view were seeing some pretty

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,050
big feet up surround the execution and

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,430
the runtime canvas excited so we see you

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,920
works everything a big part of the

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,170
future so no way to go because of all

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,790
the features we need so threading and

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,010
garbage collector stuff isn't there yet

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,940
but it's an evolving space invent when I

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,339
push it and I was not on camera

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,000
any other questions nothing

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:05,580
lieutenant what's what we can see the

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,800
bus to the core engine and the main user

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,990
gossip so the engine run to the web

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,730
worker that's not assembly in there we

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,339
are very efficient about how we should

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:35,490
theta between the web assembly heap and

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:38,430
the judges emails so for the perspective

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,780
itself a bi-state base there in our food

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,930
fully quite important if they're not

00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,240
feel free to completely fishes so

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,150
straightforward like Jason they stated

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,690
models or Apache arrow a basis where we

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,000
opened up to that the bonuses on you as

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,370
an adapter writer to like Waxman will

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,180
convert your own proprietary upstream

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:06,680
feeds to behaviour how much ever strong

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,680
as the documentation on all yeah

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,970
so documentation I think is always

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,300
working progress it's definitely a

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,100
comparison and so we've benefited I've

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,140
got us comments to bring everything up

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,880
to date and there's a lot more coming in

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,770
terms of my examples we've got pastes

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,780
integration stories and everything else

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,530
and so acted Bible Department about

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,530
whether we do

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,499
[Applause]

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,499
