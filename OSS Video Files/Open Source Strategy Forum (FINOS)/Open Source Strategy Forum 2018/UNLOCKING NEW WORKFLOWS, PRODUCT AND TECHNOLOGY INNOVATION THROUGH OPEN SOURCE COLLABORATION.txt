Title: UNLOCKING NEW WORKFLOWS, PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION THROUGH OPEN SOURCE COLLABORATION

Explore and hear about the latest open source contributions from J.P. Morgan that are enabling new workflows, industry collaboration and innovation across the digital landscape.
 
The latest contributions include the enterprise Click to Call (C2C) feature that is driving new ways to extend the user experience on collaboration platforms such as Symphony, using the power of APIs. We are also excited to be contributing a new data visualization engine, called Perspective that will provide an embedded framework enabling innovation in real time analytics while fostering active contributions across the FINOS community. It will showcase how open source collaboration on topics including data visualization will benefit and accelerate ideas across real time analytics, insights and intelligence.
