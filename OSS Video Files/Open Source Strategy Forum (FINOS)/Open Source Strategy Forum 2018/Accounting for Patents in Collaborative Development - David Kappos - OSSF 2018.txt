Presentation: Accounting for Patents in Collaborative Development

Innovation in the past decade has been been propelled by collaborative yet market-driven approaches to intellectual property rights. The standard setting process is a prime example of such a collaborative effort by incorporating the best intellectual property of a given field into a standard and insuring such standard essential patents (SEPs) are then licensed to adapters on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. This construct has resulted in groundbreaking technology in sectors ranging from telecommunications to autonomous vehicles. However, some have argued that SEPs are incompatible with open source licenses. Examining the historical record of open source development, the open source definition and relevant case law shows that open source and SEPs can and do work together to protect intellectual property rights and spur innovation.
