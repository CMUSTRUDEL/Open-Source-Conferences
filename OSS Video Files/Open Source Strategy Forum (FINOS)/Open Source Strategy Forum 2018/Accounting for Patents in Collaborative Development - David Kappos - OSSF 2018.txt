Presentation: Accounting for Patents in Collaborative Development

Innovation in the past decade has been been propelled by collaborative yet market-driven approaches to intellectual property rights. The standard setting process is a prime example of such a collaborative effort by incorporating the best intellectual property of a given field into a standard and insuring such standard essential patents (SEPs) are then licensed to adapters on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. This construct has resulted in groundbreaking technology in sectors ranging from telecommunications to autonomous vehicles. However, some have argued that SEPs are incompatible with open source licenses. Examining the historical record of open source development, the open source definition and relevant case law shows that open source and SEPs can and do work together to protect intellectual property rights and spur innovation.

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,640
so we're here to talk about patents and

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:23,550
collaborative development this morning

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,730
and I would start by saying that you

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,369
know we've had a terrific run with

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,270
innovation in the last decade that has

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:37,140
been propelled by these collaborative

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,910
and yet market driven approaches to

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,010
sharing intellectual property of course

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,760
one example great example is the efforts

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,789
made to adopt innovation driven

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,879
standards across various industries and

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,920
that involves a process that

00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,780
incorporates the best intellectual

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:04,530
property or IP in any particular field

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,900
into a standard ensuring that what's

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,909
called the patents involved or standard

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,600
essential patents we frequently refer to

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,540
them as are then licensed to adopters of

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,790
the standard on what's called fair and

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,479
reasonable or you know commonly known as

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,780
FRAND terms and of course standards

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,630
deployed innovation has resulted in many

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,250
groundbreaking developments and

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,210
technology in many fields from

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,960
autonomous vehicles to

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:41,790
telecommunications and on and on and on

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,610
it has been to paraphrase a fable with

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,380
some resonance here in Great Britain

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:52,799
truly the goose laying the golden eggs

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,439
on the other hand there's another super

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,200
successful approach to open

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,500
collaboration and that is do of course

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,110
open source software and open source of

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,700
coasts of course has an approach to IP

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,760
that gives developers access to the code

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,050
of computer programs of course developed

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,110
by others

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,470
working on a given open source project

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,900
and enables a developer to form a

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,950
community of developers and a community

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:29,430
of users to share tools and build on

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:32,100
common infrastructure companies that of

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,250
course use and manage open source

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,470
projects have succeeded in significantly

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,380
reducing software development and

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,380
maintenance costs and they've provided

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,990
customers with highly innovative and

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,960
stable and low cost software and of

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,510
course open source driven innovation has

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,210
been critical in many areas in its own

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,390
right including cloud computing and big

00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,700
data and mobile technology to name just

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,860
a few

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,550
now the issue is that as hardware and

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,010
software converge in more and more

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,170
products open-source software has found

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,710
itself increasingly included in

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,870
technology adopted in standards governed

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,540
by Frant licensing commitment so these

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,060
two historically independently

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,730
successful worlds have started coming

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,120
together and they're encountering some

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:31,890
growing pains as happens when worlds

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,989
come together that way so as many in

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,620
this audience I'm sure are aware there's

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:40,170
been an ongoing debate over open source

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,810
licenses and their integration with

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,570
Frane licensing and friend licensing

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:50,310
commitments that govern licensing of

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,820
patents covering standards one part of

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,040
the debate believes that most

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,860
open-source software licenses are

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,720
compatible with for and licensing of

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:06,000
related patents and the other side has

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,680
the belief that they are incompatible

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,880
right or to put it in an economic frame

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,640
one side argues that innovators should

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:22,070
not be permitted to charge licensing

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:26,250
fees for patents associated with

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,970
software used in standards and the other

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,520
side

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,400
argues that innovators remain free to

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,120
both contribute their open-source

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,850
software to standards and charge

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,550
licensing fees or royalties for their

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,070
patents so that's the nature of the

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,570
debate that that we're dealing with at

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:53,490
the moment so we then went out and

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:57,840
tested some assertions in this regard

00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:01,520
and you can see them here is Frant

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,350
licensing a detriment to innovation to

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,210
open-source licenses inherently are they

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,260
inherently incompatible with friend

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:14,850
licensing and is the open source

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:18,510
definition the OSD compliant license

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,760
definition always does it always contain

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:26,010
or has it always contain a patent grant

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,270
and we'll come back to that in just a

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,480
moment

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:33,330
I would start though by saying a lot has

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,669
already been said to kind of back up and

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,300
level up for a moment lots already been

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:41,880
said over the years about the first of

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,440
the two points that I just mentioned so

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,340
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,050
them but I'll touch on them just briefly

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:55,860
so we can easily see that brand

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,500
licensing isn't inherently detrimental

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,910
to innovation setting aside open source

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,040
for the moment industries like

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,070
telecommunications have foredeck among

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,220
others have for decades used friend

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,890
license saying euploid it and been

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,970
incredibly successful they've thrived

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:20,520
there's no data that shows that there's

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,980
been any detriment from Frane licensing

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,590
and in fact to the contrary it's hard to

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,380
imagine how those industries could have

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,770
achieved the level of success that they

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,350
have given the enormous investments that

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,690
are required if the innovators had been

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,990
told they'd have no way to recoup their

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,120
R&D expenses now

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,270
there's also nothing inherently

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,910
incompatible about open-source licenses

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,280
and Fran just looking on on the face of

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,530
them done to be sure there are some

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,790
open-source licenses like the GPL

00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,340
version 3 that expressly contain patent

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,220
grants in them and that therefore on

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,660
their face are incompatible with FRAND

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:12,640
licensing but that is definitely the

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:16,390
exception and not the rule with most

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,910
other licenses having no Express

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:24,430
language about patents in them at all

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:26,800
and so those other licenses are what we

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,420
call permissive licenses and they

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,340
account it turns out for the large

00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:37,180
majority of OS is approved licenses and

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:39,940
they don't contain restrictions and on

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,830
their face they are compatible with

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,530
open-source so what I'd like to do now

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:49,830
is to turn from there to what you see

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:55,000
here which is a more in-depth discussion

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:57,610
on on issues that have not been so much

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,850
discussed in the past and to give you a

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,860
bit of background to start off with if

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,080
you're not familiar with this long

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,650
history it's been about 20 years or so

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:12,880
since OSI the open source initiative was

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:17,580
formed and has and began serving as an

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:21,460
arbiter of acceptable open-source

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:25,240
licenses by maintaining this so-called

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,670
OSD or the open source definition which

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,540
has to be satisfied in order for a

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,310
license to be considered open source now

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,650
the OSD sections cover various things

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:41,190
including distribution and derived works

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:48,060
and source code and non-discrimination

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:53,660
and other aspects of particular note is

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:58,269
OSD section 1 and OSD section 7 we

00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:01,940
which imposed requirements for free

00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:05,629
redistribution now those who believe

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,009
that patent royalties run afoul of the

00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:13,730
OSD typically cite these sections as a

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:17,360
source of conflict with the OSD licenses

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,480
allowing for patent royalties now

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,699
however when you look at these sections

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,029
and look at the definitions that are

00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:29,149
associated with them neither the OSD one

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:33,970
definition which you can see now nor the

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:37,879
OSD seven definition state that an OSD

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,220
compliant license conveys a patent grant

00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:45,319
they don't refer to on their face they

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:47,750
don't cover patents however folks have

00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:52,790
suggested that even without any Express

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:56,089
language OSD compliant licenses come

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:59,089
with an implied patent grant that sets

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:04,639
up an inherent conflict between OSD one

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:07,519
or OSD seven and that this view was the

00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:12,589
view of the open source community all

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:16,569
along and so what I set out to do was to

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:19,910
look at those points in some detail and

00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,860
to remind ourselves of the conversations

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,970
Narayan you know myself of the

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:30,199
conversations surrounding OSD compliance

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:33,740
and free redistribution attendant to

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:37,610
open source software took a look at all

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:40,850
of the OSI license discuss and license

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:44,750
review archives that are available and

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,120
they go back to April 1999 and looked at

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,809
them all the way through June of 2018

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,870
you know before writing up this work

00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:58,459
looking for discussions mentioning OS d1

00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:01,790
or OS d7 and what I found was that the

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:05,480
community primarily discussed OSD one

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,929
Rose d7 in the context of analyzing

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,600
whether specific

00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:13,970
licenses were OSD compliant and there

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:19,389
wasn't really much reference of patents

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:23,679
in those those two threads of discussion

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:27,739
there were roughly 300 posts that

00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,689
specifically mentioned OS d1 or OS d7

00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:33,259
out of you know a much much larger total

00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:36,769
number of posts that and and those 300

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:41,179
or so posts mentioned licensing issues

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,199
in OS d1 or os d7 that's about 4% or

00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:44,989
sorry

00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:47,889
that's a 300 out of thousands of that's

00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:51,919
a small number and of those about 4%

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:58,249
about a dozen or so had the view that OS

00:11:51,919 --> 00:12:01,069
d1 or os d7 require patent licensing and

00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:03,589
so to be fair there were views expressed

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:06,649
through you know peppered in those four

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:09,559
percent or so about a dozen posts the

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:12,199
problem is that in each case those views

00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,699
were contemporaneously challenged by

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,369
people on the other side of the debate

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,549
saying no I don't agree there aren't

00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:22,850
licenses being granted here the issue

00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:29,329
resurfaces every now and then last

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:32,869
occurring in 2017 and so what what you

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:35,509
did not see what I didn't see was any

00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:38,389
evidence of a conclusion or a consensus

00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:40,279
being reached and if anything what the

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:44,059
data suggested was the opposite

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:47,839
conclusion that the issue of patent

00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:49,850
grants and open source licenses was not

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,350
assumed or overlooked it actually was

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,859
raised that I've mentioned it's been

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,619
raised from time to time it was rebutted

00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:59,480
and then it was discarded and indeed it

00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:01,850
still raised every once in a while and

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,970
it doesn't get traction with the

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:08,299
community so I think the only thing you

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,309
can conclude from what's happened is

00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:12,579
that at best no consensus has been

00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:12,579
reached

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:47,230
right yeah yeah I agree with that well

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:51,009
so those so those are the two parts the

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,569
two threads that contain discussion

00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:56,470
about licensing there are lots of other

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:58,870
threads that to my knowledge don't tend

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,059
to contain licensing discussion and I

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,430
agree with the comment that many of the

00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:07,389
commenters on those threads are actually

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,670
lawyers so I went in next examined the

00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:13,240
case law to see if there's any legal

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:21,540
basis for the view that an OSD compliant

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:23,889
license grants and implied license and

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,439
started with a case that's actually

00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,930
cited quite a bit in the community and I

00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:32,730
think you know well meaning it's the

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:37,120
Transcorp versus electronic transactions

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:39,519
case and it was a US case you know I'm

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,759
gonna look at US law being a u.s. lawyer

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,040
I should comment that some of the

00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,569
doctrines involved here as I understand

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,990
them are actually construed much more

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:52,180
narrowly here in the UK so you know

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,819
whatever conclusion a u.s. lawyer might

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,319
reach my understanding you can get a UK

00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,839
lawyer to comment on this more

00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:01,779
definitively is that a UK lawyer would

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:05,379
reach an even more narrow conclusion so

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:10,899
the issue with this Transcorp case is

00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:13,300
that it takes up open it it takes up

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,399
implied licenses in a very different

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,819
context than what we're talking about

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:22,660
trans Court transports implied license

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:26,110
was dependent on a specific set of facts

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,950
in that case which involved

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:33,610
an earlier express patent grant on

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:37,690
patents and in the litigation on patents

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,930
covering technology and then a covenant

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,670
not to sue that was given in the form in

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,410
the context of a settlement of that

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,839
earlier patent litigation so there was

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,209
patent litigation there was a settlement

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,029
there was a covenant not to sue which

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:55,120
means an express grant relative to

00:15:52,029 --> 00:16:00,420
patents in the Transcorp Court then

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,829
found that the covenant not to sue on a

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,890
patent that existed at the time the

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:09,070
Covenant was granted created an implied

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,990
license to a later issued related patent

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,880
so an interesting decision but

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,720
completely irrelevant to the open source

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,519
context in that decision however it is

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,630
interesting to note that the Federal

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:26,680
Circuit quoting its prior opinion in a

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:30,490
case called Wang laboratories stated

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,870
quote legal estoppel refers to a narrow

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:37,269
category of conduct encompassing

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:40,120
scenarios where a patentee has licensed

00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:42,310
or assigned a right receiving

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,329
consideration and then sought to

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,990
derogate from the right granted and so

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:53,649
there's this language used in that

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:57,339
decision that keys on narrow category of

00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:01,560
conduct and that's the way the implied

00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:05,069
licensing cases tend to work in the u.s.

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:09,850
Transcorp clearly involved patent rights

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:13,809
affirmative ly granted by a patent D to

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:18,250
begin with and so unlike the OSD license

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:20,230
context it's not a situation where

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,510
there's no affirmative right and you're

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,770
trying to figure out whether to imply

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:32,140
one so the OSD context just doesn't lend

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:35,250
itself to this case or to this thinking

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,780
of the so called narrow category of

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,920
conduct now in Wang laboratories if you

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,070
go back to that case which the federal

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,710
it was relying on it also found an

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,170
implied license but it's finding was

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,320
rooted in a different area of law

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,570
equitable rather than legal estoppel so

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,530
the plot kind of thickens in a different

00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:00,440
direction in the Wayne case and the

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:04,430
reason that's important is because legal

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:09,560
estoppel which was the the the subject

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:12,410
of the of the Transcorp case looks at

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,890
this so-called affirmative grant of

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:19,070
consent or permission to make user cell

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,860
ie looks for a license but equitable

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,920
estoppel looks in a different direction

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,870
it's focusing on misleading conduct

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,510
misleading conduct that suggests that

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,990
the patentee won't enforce its patent

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,750
rights

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,700
so equitable estoppel you know a

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:40,220
doctrine that's looking for misleading

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:42,860
conduct is even less of a basis to imply

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,720
a license in the OSD context because

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,630
there's not any suggestion at all of any

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,870
misleading conduct so you can't get

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:54,950
there either by way of legal estoppel or

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,990
by equitable estoppel I wasn't able to

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,780
reading other cases I wasn't able to

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,710
find any court case that holds that

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:07,580
patent licenses are implied in open

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:11,090
source licenses in the absence of patent

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,720
granting language specifically now some

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:17,630
have pointed to another case it's called

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,570
simple where xim ple where verses for

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:24,110
sada and that's a case where simple

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:26,510
where software was licensed under the

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,580
GPL to license agreement' so this sounds

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,040
pretty interesting right because the GPL

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,980
- it's got some language that's

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,250
pertinent it's clearly a copyleft

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,680
agreement some might say that it

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,910
expressly or impliedly makes a patent

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,160
grant and I think that's actually a

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,230
pretty darn good argument in in the case

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,900
of GPL - although I don't know that it's

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,940
completely settled but the problem with

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,730
that case is it simple we're sued

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,120
versado and its customers for

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:59,120
an infringement when its source code was

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,169
discovered in versus products and the

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,270
court treated the GPL to as a defense to

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:08,570
patent infringement so it said you know

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,919
we think that the GPO - granted a patent

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:15,770
license fair enough

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,720
says but since the GPL - does contain

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,760
patent related language and everyone

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,980
knows section seven one of our favorite

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:27,440
sections - all lawyers in GPO - it

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,150
doesn't grant an express patent license

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,760
but again you could reasonably imply a

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:37,640
patent license as the Court did in that

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:41,690
case the GPL 2 is an example it's a

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,880
situation of an example that or an

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,220
exception that proves the rule the GPL 2

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,570
is the kind of license that you might

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,490
consider using if you want to be able to

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,799
say that your that you're providing

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,540
patent grant if you really want to be

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,570
sure you're providing a patent grant use

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:05,240
the GPL 3 because it expressly does my

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:09,740
point though is that the simple wear

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:12,770
case simply can't be applied to

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,990
licensing situations where the license

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,480
is completely silent on patents which is

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,130
most of the OSD compliant licenses and

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,070
the ones that are interesting for

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,890
purposes of this discussion so it's a

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,679
fine case but it stands for the profit

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,230
it fact stands mostly most clearly for

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,600
the proposition that the licenses that

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,790
don't say anything about patent grants

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,410
can't be implied to include patent

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,419
grants you've got to have a license that

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,400
at least says something like the GPL

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:46,240
version 2 dead court made a good

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:49,580
decision in that case so in fact the

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,429
general case law surrounding implied

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,830
licenses again it indicates that if

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:58,070
anything courts are very hesitant to

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,850
imply license where one is not expressly

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,710
granted the court to discussed

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:06,200
judicially implied licenses and they use

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,500
words like rare in the cases that I read

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,230
you

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,480
see those kinds of words or found only

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,240
in the most narrow of circumstances

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,320
where one party created a work at the

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,880
other party's request and handed it over

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,470
intending the other to copy and

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,110
distribute it and that's a quote from a

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,410
case that found an implied license so

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,140
it's it's the really clear situations

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,120
where a license will be implied but some

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,510
people have argued that the distinction

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,540
between contributing to open source

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:41,770
versus distributing open source would be

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:45,140
an important factor in any judicial

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,020
analysis of whether an implied license

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,970
exists so that's to say that if you the

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:55,210
thinking is if you voluntarily

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:58,660
contribute code under a license with a

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,220
disputed scope as opposed to simply

00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,790
redistributing code that others have

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,310
created that you would be more likely to

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:11,330
have an implied license I don't know

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:13,130
about that the problem with that logic

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,000
is that in the end whether you've

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:19,040
granted a license or not depends on the

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,600
language of the underlying license and

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,190
the law that we've just been talking

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,590
about and it doesn't make a distinction

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,710
between code you created and distribute

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,530
versus code that you just redistribute

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:35,870
so I couldn't find any basis to draw

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:40,550
that distinction in fact you know it can

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:43,870
just as easily be argued that that that

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:46,160
a party that's only contributing code

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,920
under the assumption that they're not

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,200
relinquishing any patent rights

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,580
it isn't relinquishing any patent rights

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,830
anymore than the party that

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,810
redistributes code that they didn't

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,150
write under the presumption that they're

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,100
not divesting any patent right so I

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:06,140
wasn't able to construct an argument

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:13,300
that distributing your own code makes

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:13,300
any difference in this regard so I

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,240
looked at another question - which is

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,570
you know we've got you know these really

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,840
famous benchmark licenses that have been

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:30,260
around a long time why not just ask the

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,570
folks who own if you will or created and

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,670
are the the namesakes of these licenses

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:39,500
what they meant and how they interpret

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:42,290
them and so I did that and and contacted

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:45,200
both the folks at Berkeley in their tech

00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,480
transfer office which is where the you

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:55,010
know the BSD is owned if you will and

00:24:47,480 --> 00:25:01,040
the folks at MIT and so they also said

00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:04,940
that probably not surprisingly that they

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,400
do not consider their licenses to convey

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,210
patent grants of any kind the Berkeley

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:14,030
office of tech transfer recommends the

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:17,300
BSD to their community members they said

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,960
specifically because there are minimal

00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,200
restrictions and maximum compatibility

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:28,340
with other software and licenses and in

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,460
the case of MIT the there guy in charge

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,280
of their license who's Dan dar Dini

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:37,760
noted interpreting OSD compliant

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,770
licenses and his view to include implied

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,530
patent grants would create a huge

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,200
potential conflict with mi t--'s

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,900
portfolio of patented technology so in

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,400
both cases the tech transfer office has

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:55,580
said no we didn't then don't intend that

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,970
our licenses convey any patent rights

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,640
you know going back to the comments that

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,550
people make about their intent with

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,960
these licenses I mean you folks could go

00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,790
at Dan giardiniera I'm sure would be

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,910
happy to answer emails or get on the

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:13,220
phone with anyone as would the folks at

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,520
Berkeley what they were conveying to me

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,530
was their wreck their recollection and

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,900
their intent from the very beginning not

00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,429
just how we reinterpret our agreement

00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,530
now but they were saying look we never

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:27,610
from the beginning we never met these

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:30,140
licenses and to the point about courts

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,690
having their own views yeah sure courts

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,890
have their own view but courts views are

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,590
based on evidence

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,750
and evidence is you know what people

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,730
wrote we've talked about that what

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,880
people said contemporaneously with

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,580
events that's the OS d1 and OS d7 files

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,140
and I went back and looked at and what

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,810
people who are knowledgeable the

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,210
purveyors of these agreements said and

00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,040
say and so I would say that while courts

00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,580
will make their decisions all of this

00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,650
information would be quite probative to

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,620
you know how these agreements were and

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:41,240
now should be interpreted so we got a

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:45,620
couple of other questions man oh sure

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,590
does and the these guys were very clear

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:51,140
to point out that the reason they

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:54,770
encourage their scientists to use these

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,420
licenses is because there's no patent

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,090
grants involved what they're concerned

00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,880
about at places like Berkeley and MIT is

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,650
an incoming patent grant nobody Sue's

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,840
universities for patent infringement

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,790
because universities don't make anything

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,760
they're concerned about licensing their

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,920
patents outbound right and so their

00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,840
whole concern is they don't want to be

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,590
granting patent rights because they want

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,730
their patents to be useful to recover

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:23,510
royalties to be able to fund more

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,140
research so this brings us back actually

00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:30,040
in concluding to the bigger picture

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,560
which is that OSD compliant licenses

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:37,040
can't really be viewed in isolation

00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,170
they're part of a larger ecosystem the

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,290
software they cover is now integrated

00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:44,060
into very sophisticated products like

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,360
the smartphones that we all have in our

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,309
pockets right now that encompass lots of

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,780
IP

00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,820
involving lots of functions and lots of

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,150
components and given the level of

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,180
integration of open-source software into

00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:02,540
such widely varying products containing

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,320
innovations well beyond the software an

00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:09,040
implied patent license to the software

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:13,580
inherently extends to those further

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:16,400
innovations this in turn creates an

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,040
unavoidable consequence of open source

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,760
software then undermining patent rights

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,370
well beyond the software itself if it

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,860
was interpreted as conveying these broad

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,870
implied licenses and that would be an

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,740
extreme result I don't think anybody

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,720
would have said they intended that the

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,760
distributing open source software would

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,160
grant a license to you know an entire

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,220
large product including lots and lots of

00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,800
hardware and other functions and you're

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,940
trying to imply a patent grant from an

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,460
OSD compliant license really is trying

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,910
to solve a problem that's already

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:59,090
addressed by existing safeguards and

00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:01,970
what I mean by that is that the measure

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:05,090
isn't necessary to protect technology

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:08,150
implementers from unfair royalties in

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:11,270
fact the France system of Licensing too

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:15,950
requires standard development

00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:18,980
organisations and their their adherence

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:22,490
to take licenses and grant them on

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,559
reasonable terms already constrains the

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,720
behavior of all parties involved it's

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,910
been enormous ly successful in doing

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,059
that and of course as I mentioned before

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,370
open-source authors who want to extend a

00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:36,980
patent license always have the ability

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:40,940
to do that and can simply do it by using

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:46,030
the GPL 3 which has an express patent

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:49,070
grant in it and so I'll end it there and

00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:52,700
just say that that you know by way of a

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:56,870
sort of a final summary so we looked at

00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,950
at these conflicting positions about OSD

00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:04,159
licenses we examine the facts and law

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:06,409
find them we didn't find significant

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,860
support for the notion that OSD

00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:12,470
compliant licences convey patent rights

00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:18,950
not in the case law it's not in any

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:22,220
community consensus so in short what we

00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:25,429
found was an OSD license or can choose

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:28,190
to grant a patent license or like MIT

00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:31,639
and Berkeley can choose not to do so and

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:35,620
preserve the ability for OS s open

00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:38,149
source and s EPS to work in tandem in

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,799
advancing integration advancing

00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:44,450
innovation and I would say that

00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,840
integrating thinking about open source

00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:53,120
licenses and Frant licensing in that

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:55,399
kind of integrated way is fits really

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,889
well into the European Commission's own

00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:00,769
conclusions in this regard which is that

00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:03,980
it creates a win-win situation I'll stop

00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:05,779
there we're out of time so we can have

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,000
outside discussion if people want to

00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:11,139
free up the room for the next meeting

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,139
okay thank you

00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,469
