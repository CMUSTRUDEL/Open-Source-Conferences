Presentation: Supporting Innovation and Stability in FSI Solutions Development with Open Source Platforms

Open source is driving innovation by allowing contributors to adapt, extend and change software quickly to respond to market needs. Financial services are striving to reduce cost of support and operations through a modern platform that services customers and associates.

As financial services use new technology to extend market reach, technology operations are challenged to support solutions which sometimes are difficult to manage at scale. Ops and Security know that open source is not free lunch as it has to engineered, integrated into the bank operations and processes to ensure regulatory compliance.

Balancing developersâ€™ freedom of choice vs day-two supportability cannot be ignored.

Attend this session to learn about unifying the needs for innovation and stability through an open source platform. The selection of fundamental capabilities such as cloud readiness, scale, auditability, transparency, ease of integration, product lifecycle standards can benefit both FinTech and FinServ. Open source means also tapping into a large talent pool of professionals that want to work with visibility and collaboratively.

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:24,330
goodnight session I saw the prytaneum

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:27,720
director of strategy and solutions at

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,810
banks having fun and then way much more

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,460
part of it I and Steve okay with you as

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:39,239
a partner so talk about platforming open

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,010
source platforming and specifically see

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,370
how we can use this open source

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:52,829
platforms for banking industry we do

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:55,190
have some specific requirements so this

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,609
is your general like to address with you

00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,079
journey miss pinning what we are to even

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,750
in financial services are kind of

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,549
freedom leave it strange to talk to you

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,470
the bankers they T you know way more

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:13,470
than me but I've been there with you

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:17,540
also is a journey and talking about the

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,540
path of pollution or the parallel path

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,360
how do we get there standardization is a

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,300
quickie and open source is placed and

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:45,100
accusation it's for both

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:48,550
to the next stage and instead

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,370
open-source a way to solve problems may

00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,080
be on that see let's go addictive what

00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,570
does it mean and also what is for me yes

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,970
technology is as a banker as a business

00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,800
guy answer and consumer it's really

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,650
something that we want to latch on we

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,440
want to rely on and the rely on is

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:10,479
important because we understand also how

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:19,210
safe is open source services also for

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:21,670
general mission and if we are opting to

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,370
you embrace open source do we have the

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:29,430
right elements but as it needs and the

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,430
Masters in order to safely rubbish

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,230
so if I look summarize what is our

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,980
reading of financial services I would

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,050
see them completely need to do a much

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,920
better job in to help in our and

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:57,160
consumers the customers probably they

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,510
prefer nowadays Facebook interface and

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,990
Instagram slack or whatsapp is the bank

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,600
up to par to really engage with young

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,890
customer with easy of use and mobility

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,890
as Facebook it's not there yet that is

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,900
actually our dream to be easily

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,930
consumable as becoming your financial

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,730
buddy other than the place what I need

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,130
to go to the ATM which is three miles

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,280
away and I can find a parking lot

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,840
painting I want cash now and picanha can

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,640
be a media digital cash doesn't the

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,500
problem of the present we are regulated

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,980
financial services of course it's

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,020
important stability source economy can

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,930
we move of innovation and still be

00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,150
compliant transparent as the big little

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,940
box and also as we do bonkers banking

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:54,520
because we need to operate in a certain

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:57,790
way and of course you know banking is

00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,390
money we want to stay home of monetize

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,700
more and more and continuously be

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,840
pressured with regulation and also the

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,450
need to improve in our way to operate we

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,800
have a struggle in - up to monetize

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:18,430
right away to case we know and of course

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,859
you know we now entering the new fear of

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,200
banking and teach the world I'll be able

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:27,420
to complete each study among yourself as

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:31,200
banks but more importantly we can we

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,200
offered what the customer

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:39,710
so response to these drivers from the

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,280
Itanium banking cycle definitely is to

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,520
work for developing much more elegant

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,140
user experience and interface to the end

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:54,230
user the other point of view is how to

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,710
get their tour processes we need be able

00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:00,950
to change the way we board with agility

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,400
and ending in to what we talked a little

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,590
more into what I feel is the goal is the

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,440
objective is the continuous evolution

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:14,030
continuous innovation three main then of

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,730
course you know why we're doing so we're

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,530
also want to grow a vibrational cars

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,150
there's still a lot of cars a lot of

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,180
complexity in the bank

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,570
there are kept xenomania processing that

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,930
way optimized can we why we introducing

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,390
new technology new processes also know

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:43,190
where they need to manually allow staff

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:45,320
to be things so transformation toward a

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,920
better way to operate it to serve

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,200
customers is a journey that has

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,720
dimensions it's not just technology is

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,140
not just the cloud they're elements and

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:00,320
I would summarize in 20 major you know

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,900
elements one is definitely that need to

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,420
be combined the capability in the

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,610
banking sector in terms of application

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,560
for the end user or the associate it

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,010
with new architecture we were flexible

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,320
highly scalable reusable reducing that

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,710
10,000 plus application types in the

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,440
bank to maybe less with a very thorough

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,480
enterprise architecture this is all

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,010
about you know next-gen architecture

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:31,190
banking and definitely is clear that

00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,290
maybe running the data center only it's

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,860
probably not the way to go especially if

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,860
you think your back should be

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,380
you know a service company and how to

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,630
serve the customers by still need to

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,420
offer it is very expensive data centers

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,760
with colocation and a lot of redundancy

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,670
what is their opportunity to use

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,350
infrastructure with cloud is technically

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,450
appealing to take a look at the

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,660
reduction of course that the cloud

00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,990
providers can can offer is that possible

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:10,140
to use public cloud this is the big

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:12,870
debate across every back then it's

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,540
people which is all about people all the

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,610
time how we try to change how we

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:22,620
collaborate among each other so

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:26,280
double-click in here in this evolution

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,680
in the three major streams I want to

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,930
highlight a little more with sequence

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:35,960
here and as we started initially having

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:41,340
application of our political you know

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:44,280
mainframe centric we screen we also had

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,200
been working on project looking at the

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,210
requirements and spending a lot of money

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,730
the ceremony to be now and are we going

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,910
to be deliver in today's testing and

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,400
putting a production 18-month two years

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,940
is actually an average project length

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,590
six months maybe if you're really smart

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,850
but it's not enough for the speed that

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,370
your customer wants to see the new

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:08,160
capability to do way to consume

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:13,260
financial service offering as any other

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:16,260
thing in life like autonomous car which

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:20,070
is much faster and then the technology

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:23,700
solidification infrastructure huge huge

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:26,970
cost are we're beefed up out we're very

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,670
power servers mainframes there is

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,390
hopefully the past but we still are

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,390
running this

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,790
the bag and now we're moving toward more

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,740
you know can we go somewhere else maybe

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,470
there is a service provided we can use

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,580
to lower my cost of ownership or for a

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,580
deed a sentence

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,220
we also think more a GPA in the

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,750
generator when we think to manage our

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,050
project for the delivery

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,640
so agility a big momentum is probably

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,370
all up and running and happening in

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,380
every organization and of course from

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,410
the point of view of evolution now we

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,200
are going into understanding the problem

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,110
within an element of business capability

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,380
that can be dealt more granular either

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,920
than the big cards of the big solution

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,410
that we buy some time from vendors we

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,810
want to be we architect everything so we

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,580
had one point where the responsibility

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,520
for one business budget is there only

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,110
and there is been orchestrated with any

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,510
other business function in terms of

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,810
micro services micro services for the

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,430
term is used over use of you you have

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,620
your own people match the release but

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,580
it's actually Eddy the place but one

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,260
business function banking is process the

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,020
authority the responsibility is there

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,640
and if you need to deal in a business

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,830
process whatever is the journey could be

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,290
a loan origination could be opening a

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,900
bank account that particular function is

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,830
there that micro service upon said there

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,640
can be also reused across the journey of

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,560
any business processes services and why

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
is interesting micro services because

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,960
with the evolution of the technology in

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,410
the protector micro services and element

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,590
of architecture which I would continue

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,450
rising them it's kind of what we see it

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,220
where that we are kind of sensitive with

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,110
this container work of course because we

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,410
see as the way to create a new

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,540
marketplace for capabilities

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,920
standardization of packaging

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,620
standardization of the

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,240
the supply chain between track is v's

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,070
provide the global system integrator

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,769
they know how to handle this new way to

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,920
contain a business function to manage to

00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,570
deploy to scale it all standardized if

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,550
you think that the decision in our world

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,550
the containers in the real world

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,800
shipping we have been able to lower the

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,779
cost of transportation by the means of

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,470
defining to standard continuous form of

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,500
2043 nothing else and it analysis Paulo

00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,500
which is more expensive and the way we

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,339
went to do so it took probably 40 50

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,380
years to build all the ports and all the

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:09,110
cranes and all the system the chasis

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,970
that you know is parallel to what is

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,110
happening now we decided a standard

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,100
issue was the control over

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:20,240
transportation costs and eventually in

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,850
the in the infrastructure now that we

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:32,269
examine there is an opportunity not to

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:34,519
use powers so I mention containers as a

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:37,730
key word but continuous it becomes

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,300
really this new way of wrapping the

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,390
goods in a standard way we're inside we

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,000
put of the logic all the elements of

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,490
reusability we can create a marketplace

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,610
where people send by containerized

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,209
business function so we are going toward

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,910
the next-gen of standardization of for

00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:01,370
softer enable capability and that's what

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:04,790
we really like here to emphasize America

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,769
this line is not comprehensive it's just

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,320
to kind of the Pequot that is a

00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:13,940
container or a business capability

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:18,050
well imagine this very portable pallet

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,420
where we tightly put capabilities in one

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,300
standard for and the capability

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,779
minimally is an identity what is the

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,870
component doing right how can be

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,640
discovered how can we

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,260
Jews that can be deployed a complete

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,430
package or can be shipped between the

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:38,130
supply chain and of course he also in

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,110
your the representation of something

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,090
which is the loan origination

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,310
micro-services knows everything about

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:48,750
donor origination so we want to ask that

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:51,210
micro services service how to go to you

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,280
know or the customer with certain

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,990
profile and the profile Greece is again

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,540
another micro service that understand

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,320
risk profile for third party or for a

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,450
customer

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,300
so we type together now this capability

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,000
any kind of workflow among the

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,460
containers among the micro services and

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,530
what is interesting if before we were

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,600
doing centralized architecture will be a

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,900
business processes that tried to touch

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,510
base on MPI capability tomorrow is going

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,990
to be this spontaneous workflow between

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,360
business capability they know they

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,480
discover each other they know who - us -

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:32,180
about what so think about this Putin is

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:36,120
warlock answer which is emerging as well

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,310
how we talk or how these containers talk

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,960
to each other micro services well api's

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:45,390
see I mean everywhere these days it's a

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,950
standard way to use capability without

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,510
owning a piece of something that

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,970
somebody a survivor you know is an

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:54,210
interface we know with the specification

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,010
through the manifest describe what can I

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,230
do for you as a micro service of what

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:02,130
can you ask me and more so how can

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,380
interact with you so that goes through a

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,030
communication so how this business

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,980
function will communicate among

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,170
themselves within the corporation and

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,460
beyond the preparation boundary because

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:16,980
water flows will and are already intra

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,960
or intercompany workflows

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,740
meaning banks talking to other banks in

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:27,180
the supply chain so the trading floor

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,760
talks to the trainees may be goes into

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,130
settlement or the other function that

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,920
might be actually also to another party

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,799
right so I

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,600
maybe very well trainee because I'm very

00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,129
good into pretty mama you know one of

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
the settlement I just

00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,629
standardized the processor to give to

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:50,160
somebody else because the one out

00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:53,649
shortly once we are able to finally

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,009
standardize the way we market discover

00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,839
communicate among the components deploy

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:01,389
that becomes actually the very

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,489
interesting opportunity so no matter

00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,129
what we are still wrong in our data

00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:08,019
center on the physical box or maybe you

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,829
wanna work in our further picturization

00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:15,609
day or whatever it is but also now since

00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:17,230
I am now standardizing we I describe

00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:19,480
myself as a business function the

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,269
platform and so to standardize the way I

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,549
can operate on the platform I can also

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,160
now start thinking about private cloud

00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:29,679
and also a public cloud that is the

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,949
beauty of this new world so traditional

00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,839
wardrobe like sugar or even internet

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,689
deals computing or cloud native

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,730
computing it becomes a common

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,919
denominator when we are starting

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:48,369
standardized in packaging runtimes

00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:50,829
scale monitoring this way company like

00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:53,709
my dad spent a lot of work so if we have

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:56,679
been happy running any software on any

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:59,860
other do practices function today we are

00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:04,679
enabling to run any type of software on

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,679
any infrastructure mini private public

00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:11,910
how are we going to go to change our

00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:15,850
banks a lot of work I don't worry

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,889
so for paradise of course why do we want

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,779
to optimize what we have already try to

00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,180
reduce the cost in the data center for

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,190
example why to civilization as

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,130
maybe contender is Asian for higher

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:31,810
scale stupid some numbers if you were

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:36,250
able to run 2050 the ends per host we

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:38,950
can run 500 containerized workload be

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,980
the same host so now we have a 20 or 10

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,370
20 fact or more and actually was reading

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,070
a document from a bank we working with

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,660
saying what we could around each other

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:52,330
2,000 or 5,000 application I'm gonna

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,730
bite that service tank servers 5,000

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,580
application why because they reduce the

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,529
footprint to make it so minimally needed

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,959
in the containerized world that yes they

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:10,809
need a time server more to run 5

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:14,439
application more which is phenomenal so

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:16,870
why are you going to use to optimize of

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,540
the data center on the other side Andy

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,990
we also want to modernize on our

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,179
processes and so what we want what were

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,370
we trying to achieve here the four

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:28,809
fundamental elements here we definitely

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,240
wanna gain efficiency in the way we

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,740
operate our platform we wanna improve

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,520
productivity process is all about

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,670
shipping processes and services and

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:44,470
offering our customers better so few

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:47,860
numbers again 18 months 12 the average

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,160
time to deliver for an okapi shall be

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,440
more a patch or an update to a service

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,900
so we have been seen bags from minimum

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,809
beaming I know banks to very large bank

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,090
moving from nine nine nine month to

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,730
delivery time to three times a week

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,800
this is being documented Palliser's you

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,440
can read a newspaper and if you if you

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,780
want to add references call us we have

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,900
tons of information publicly available

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,390
real nine months three times a week I

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,180
think it's phenomenal it's a lot of work

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,160
initially but that is the attitude and

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,100
the other two is thinking continuously

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,050
Michael changes get a micro services

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,800
right micro changes is going into the

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,290
Contino

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,810
I was reading this report again from his

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,590
bags you know this is this product has

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,840
no end

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,550
why because it's a continuum illusion I

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,600
love the statement think about that

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,520
right how cool is that

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,500
they say I don't have approach of the

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,380
guinea approach that is just a journey

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,710
and we diligently make sure that the

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,900
timing on the delivery is constant three

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,240
minutes that is phenomenal I think it's

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,580
beautiful this is the axis of continuous

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,580
innovation that's what we're going to

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:09,760
sew back to open source can we out what

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:13,150
is that for me IP banker what's that for

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,550
me and customer but other sources they

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,390
an mentioned many other speakers and

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,890
colleagues here

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,090
it's not about code only is much more

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,370
it's an attitude right is the

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,890
collaboration spirit is knowing there

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,260
are much bigger problem than any single

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,210
company African so nowadays then I give

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,480
you some example you heard about

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,800
blockchain you heard about cloud native

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,170
computing there's no more than one

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:43,120
company to the time right sorry that is

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,150
participating you have other brands of

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,430
the big names left India right is

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:51,430
working for the really good together in

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,980
a collaborative way sure about

00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:56,700
transparency some of the babies are

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,700
patients

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,049
so open-source as being an overseas

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,120
source of innovation and this diagram is

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:14,649
interesting issues that they mentioned

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,980
and are not even enough but it will

00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:20,110
never end to update this diagram think

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,690
about data analytics the way that

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:26,169
information is flowing in and out and it

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,679
traverses the organization the essence

00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:31,480
of everything everything is open source

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,070
or is turned to be all open source

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,480
mobility management and automation

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,070
infrastructure as a service kubernetes

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,830
we work when it is one of the biggest

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,929
profit projects ever across any company

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,580
and everybody's joining by the day and

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:53,830
then you even tell me there are the

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:56,110
leaders so open source definitely is a

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,730
place where we want to be we want to

00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,529
talk about the innovation we want to

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,390
participate that's what we're here so

00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,190
this diagram already from the end

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,080
whoever was here the previous session

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,460
but I want to highlight one thing that

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,770
could kind of a bubble there is the

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,690
contribution concept and I think this

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,429
example because that needs to be one of

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,159
the slide in my corporation you can

00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:17,740
change name and project and distribution

00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,600
but the concept of the same there are

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,909
tons of project up there would be all

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,950
contributed work together then in

00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:27,929
company life where there are many others

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,890
derive the bids from the community and

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,690
stabilize them to win the press

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,110
consumption there's a lot of work to be

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,480
done

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,220
they had mentioned before is not easy or

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,260
at all there's a farm integration

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,080
freedom but what is interesting is that

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,480
error back into the cloud into the

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,789
project how is the contribution

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,090
contribution is the essence the company

00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:51,340
like that I don't do any coach in each

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,130
without prior going into the community

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,390
to discuss again much that I can give

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,950
you a piece of code because you want

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,600
even if you pay me a lot of money I

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,590
can't

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,720
I cannot it's my choice it's my religion

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:07,020
I go to the community I'll discuss

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,390
between the community I am there a lot

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,100
of people so it's easy to convince right

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,200
that's the trick right you want to

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,140
contribute more it's a lot of work but

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,650
eventually if the community likes it we

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,900
retake the updating we probably grow and

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,910
we bring it back to the consumption of

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,390
the enterprise in terms of software

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:29,130
delivery package package delivery which

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,840
is stable which is secure which is

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,030
documented people mention about

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,740
documentation very important right open

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,230
source is generally not documented or is

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,659
a little bit about the picture in the

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,929
github whatever pretty much these we

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:44,970
spend a lot of time by documenting a lot

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:47,190
and not only documentation testing audit

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,020
engineering security patches and some

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,179
other stuff that's what companies like

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,520
for that to spend a lot of time in to

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:59,159
secure a bit and here is where we are

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,039
the same way that we will SAP storage

00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,350
Linux of agencies I can we be then open

00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,179
source piece of bank these things may be

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,120
a question for you to the common thing

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,179
right can I do

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,100
Nona origination in an open source way

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:17,039
can you manage to deposit so maybe the

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,340
interface to open banking standards to

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:24,419
way in a way that a community what drive

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,400
and probably will be able to deliver

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,500
this in any bank because it's something

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,630
that you just download somewhere

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,309
know your customer is that my problem

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,909
your problem is everybody's problem

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,289
no your customer and some risk

00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:39,299
third-party liability rays

00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:41,309
I'm time any longer it's nobody's

00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,680
problem is everybody's probably makes so

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,250
much sense to do you know

00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,530
no sway of course there are some IPS and

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,300
that's the right hand side comment the

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,510
balance between intellectual property

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,130
and open sourcing but that's the choice

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,440
it's really up to us to decide

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,560
especially banking how much is the

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,260
portion that is IP the tweeting out the

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,770
cost profit number II to you but that

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,600
class before trading yes so for every

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,760
time and don't get me know this is not a

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,100
list that is absolutely not inclusive of

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,710
everything we needs just an example it's

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,140
probably four thousand please long the

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,390
example architecture in financial

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,000
services why is an idea here if this is

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,010
the time right can be plainly to be big

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,430
open source maybe the claimant

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:31,010
instruction that are being sent over the

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,200
wire between your path part of sales and

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,600
then and then the aggregator on the

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,090
network and issued and the credit card

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,340
company maybe those can be tapped open

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,100
source Li but maybe the front of our

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,450
resource because we understand we need

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,790
to for example bring new information

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,580
element within the transaction from end

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,410
consumers to the banking issuer because

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,900
we can provide by the body back to the

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,420
consumer if we open the standard of

00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,760
which information goes from the point of

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:02,270
say transaction or the without to be

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,010
sure and back to use maybe as loyalty I

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,680
don't tend to see much because the

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:16,850
protocol is not open I will not able to

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:18,680
give you the better service yeah that's

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,330
right it's happening it's just no

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,800
battery everywhere it's a matter of

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:27,710
adoption right is it some way and so

00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,870
going down to the console utilization

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,950
that's the idea we don't need the common

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,250
cause for everybody

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:37,660
do we really need to be right compliance

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,130
framework auditing is frame or logging

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,250
describing financial object is actually

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,570
quite project near a penis is obviously

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,420
if I send an article from the

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,160
training for into the settlement or

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,290
linking to my counterpart from by

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,990
sighted in South Side if we are clear

00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:01,530
not a way to represent things point in

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:04,710
time in the life cycle of a trade and

00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:08,580
also distributed application generic

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,380
term meaning uber workflows I remember

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,920
working with that she parted the torture

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,290
but I used to work and brilliant man and

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,790
say my son Drew canceled the work the

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,140
business problem for the world for

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,570
problem because we need the workflow of

00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,520
the more clothes very cool the poor for

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,760
the workflows is the problem

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,950
a maybe distributed application

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:32,310
blockchain I know it could be a way to

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,990
be repeated everything so again what is

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:38,640
the best way to discuss open source

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:41,670
changes and of course the more we go

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,710
down into the technicalities so in the

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:47,640
business value to the cuffs we all given

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:50,850
up to the big open source place already

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,670
a prevalent role and companies like

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:58,410
vendors like us have been demonstrating

00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:02,060
there we can now what we need to do as a

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:04,560
as a community is to define the

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,480
capability of such platform features

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,510
which are not unique for them for the

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,140
industry to make that compliant to the

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:16,560
regulation that industry needs to oblige

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:23,400
so that supportive entity and here is

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:25,830
maybe the vision can we go to order

00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,430
effects for banking I do believe that we

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,870
can do part of it it's a huge journey

00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,970
it's probably billion dollar journey

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,340
here but it's obvious here that

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,940
financial services with a perf intact

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,980
the partners not anymore the contenders

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,179
because it's obvious there is a mutual

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,399
relationship between the Quinta Inn

00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:49,190
industry in terms of you know who has

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:52,429
the money to implement to invest into it

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,559
was that the skills not to be highly

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:57,559
regulated but still very first this is

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:02,029
the beautiful place but open source it

00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:04,070
in printer and since we're converging to

00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:06,669
product and be running for example in

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,919
this community this is an amazing place

00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:11,419
Pinta pincer vendor hopefully

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:18,169
collaborated we come with the car

00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:21,980
problem we can utilize now why we're

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:23,960
doing so that we need to tool we need to

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,730
have the right tool to do so

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,509
and you know so we need to ask ourself

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:33,940
is such platforms or capability are in

00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:37,820
place to ensure that we do it safely way

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,499
with you are support all the parties

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,960
developers because our bodies are about

00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:43,549
the benefits and end of story

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,009
amplifiers their own language of

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:47,749
preference can be automated everything

00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:50,299
so I don't want to go to all the

00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:53,330
elements is just ideas but if you think

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:56,149
a capability model and you decided to

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,600
what are the master that wishful things

00:28:56,149 --> 00:29:01,490
to have you need to you will figuring

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,529
out you have your imperatives definitely

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,200
secure is one we will never properly

00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:08,929
diagnose security ever it's way too much

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,639
to lose maybe something else is

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:15,470
happening more organically on journey

00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:16,879
automation security standardization

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,210
sub-servicer probably

00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:23,379
targets for everything and the journeys

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,379
are across dimension

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:31,670
and again going into this capability

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:35,210
there are some masters that we need to

00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:37,010
stand out firmly we need to have the

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,390
customer and saw in the blenders to

00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,600
really work very hard to solve the

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:43,820
problem and I can't I can't list them

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,540
all because everybody zero priority but

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:51,620
definitely open source is great is farm

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:55,310
- this must there's no way ever that we

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,200
can't allow to run the economy in an

00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:00,290
unsafe way that's why Bank has been

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,930
spending billions of donors and a lot of

00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,510
Mines reins to really secure the

00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,760
operation everything now counting how

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,340
many cyberthreat and if every bearing

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,320
every day is been after probably don't

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,980
even don't even sharing them by the

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:21,320
millions per day it's funny I used to

00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:24,290
work for this shipping company what is

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,210
beautiful here we the standardization

00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,580
that we meant before I mean you guys

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:31,310
know why this ship doesn't collapse

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,990
doesn't doesn't really sink the recent

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,060
lot of stuff going on here

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,970
containers are interlocked and election

00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,890
to each other because a standardization

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,650
2014 cannot observe the weight that the

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:44,270
heavy continuous are stowed below and

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,400
the lightweight containers of the acting

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:50,210
to be requisition are stored above is

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,300
science is not by chance the stevedore

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:55,880
planners are engineers certified they do

00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,130
everyday balance the ship for port to

00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,620
port for destination to destination when

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:04,900
they take our go in for export food or

00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:07,940
whether requisition containers position

00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:10,460
so this is where open source and

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:15,110
standard play a very important role for

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,960
the for normalizing and neutralizing the

00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,780
transportation

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,130
industry however in the operation work

00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,110
safety is guaranteed by employing dist

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:32,280
under and putting in to keep operating

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:37,590
procedure at scale and I will land up

00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:40,470
here my feel proud to say this is our

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:44,030
model right however that we believe that

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,030
open unlocks the world

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:59,369
[Applause]

00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:25,510
so the contrary to the public cloud

00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:31,090
project together myself well I love that

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:32,890
it is a black and white so I really if I

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:36,090
quickly understand the question you're

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:40,870
saying can go back to slide show maybe

00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,940
context here are you referring to the

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:54,159
line in the comics

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:56,139
no it takes a long time yeah okay I like

00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,100
this question first of all do I need to

00:32:56,139 --> 00:33:02,019
repeat so hour long does it take to take

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,529
advantage of the opportunity to use of

00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:06,820
hybrid multi calm environment and I like

00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:08,919
that you mentioned the matter because

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,779
there the persona involved in this

00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,240
journey at the technologies of the

00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:16,710
platform when they see innovation from

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,120
moving to pair a pair where are going to

00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:25,210
visualization that already running done

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:27,760
right and also going into how do we care

00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:30,880
to the place where environments can be

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,799
procured with a click and then we ticket

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,919
that goes back to people again that may

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,840
be five weeks later give you these

00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,399
servers which always go get some

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,279
typically from other piece of database

00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,929
now are the five weeks

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,639
it's a drama every day everybody has

00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,130
dealt with a project you forgot the

00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:48,970
requirements too bad another ticket five

00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,039
weeks later

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,650
that's the problem right so that's where

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,490
is evolution from the provisioning of

00:33:53,650 --> 00:34:01,650
the developer what I see the beauty is

00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:04,480
if the developer now is not longer

00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:08,520
needed to think about the architectural

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,860
requirements to the code escapes pure

00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,780
employable but we are able to now take

00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,179
all this responsibility we were coding

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,669
against by line code connecting this

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:21,940
data safe literally the other also if it

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,620
equals now I need to flip over connect

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,350
to this messaging system and that the

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,450
backup channel is called called 1 to 2

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,770
language what we are trying when we are

00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,020
doing now this is beautiful the

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:35,669
devolution of the architecture more and

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:42,159
more capability are now delegated to the

00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:43,810
infrastructure to the framework so I

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,620
need to run

00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:52,480
how many unit of deployment is many more

00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,300
like three databases the backup the data

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,670
center world the other one no I mean

00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,110
endpoint I need to read some right

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,960
quality to write some record you

00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:04,420
classroom figure it out if I need to

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,040
have 10 degrees underneath or hundred

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,500
but then it should be distributed a

00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,030
scale what is the transaction to cross

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,830
data center across the board in a

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,710
synchronous way or in a non synchronous

00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:18,340
way that's the beauty thing in terms of

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:20,860
evolution is I can spread out everything

00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:24,670
as a piece of configuration so

00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:27,040
configuration as configuration s code

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,770
meaning we can codify this capability

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:34,990
that before we we needed to code them

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:37,300
that's why thing is devolution and of

00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,100
course there requires to understand what

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
you can use in the lab can you discover

00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,340
the service can you

00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,140
can you obstructed up completed on the

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,360
protocols that will you communicate you

00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,670
represent things neither there's being a

00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,460
lot of evolution so you asked me how

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:54,490
fast I think the company that I have

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,250
embraced and they believe in needing to

00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,380
do this they've built some places some

00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,300
sandbox and they allow people to

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,840
experiment on the modes will make to

00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,850
Google

00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,910
now's your company give you a day a week

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:09,580
to do what really you would like to do

00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:11,290
that is the key right again a style even

00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,690
management here there's a lot of

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,310
responsibility to allow you to play with

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:23,410
this new architecture with it means

00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:26,980
toolkit so back to your box I need that

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,990
time to learn this new stuff I must no

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,380
way and you've this modified over here

00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:57,190
that's work set one more question we

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:59,140
need to get yep lunch so early alright

00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,950
so what is missing here definitely is a

00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:05,410
mega initiatives probably local banking

00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,210
so the factor will be making is also

00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,760
being driven by regulation especially in

00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,400
Europe has been a big driver but is

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,980
definitely understood by everybody there

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,960
is actually a friendship factor first in

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,300
a competitive advantage capability to

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,760
well so open banking is probably one of

00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,910
the things that I see more progress just

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:30,280
because we have two regulators because

00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:32,380
the government second because if you are

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,750
doing so you're opening your business

00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,930
model to use the power in a much bigger

00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,940
channels

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,829
services you're gonna complete you

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,569
cannot you cannot really actually win up

00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:47,970
to the body's region are now catching up

00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,980
even preventing even leapfrogging and

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,470
they come and even the regulate of

00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,970
themselves they're starting to you know

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,339
to see that this is becoming a

00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:02,400
competitive so open banking that is one

00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:05,430
I would say even risk even ourselves be

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,059
a documented risk risk pricing risk

00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,680
analogies in open source way we spend a

00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,630
lot of money their company spent three

00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,490
forty million dollars to run risk we

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,099
know that he mentioned the company and

00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,410
babies of abusing here in this room then

00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:22,109
you know we're talking about is hundred

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:25,349
thousand quarterback running risk and

00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:44,700
analytics and just crunching numbers can

00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:46,760
be doing totally there is a court dark

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,500
or open source core banking platforms

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,609
insurance is also opening up their

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:56,790
policy and claims name of the company

00:38:53,609 --> 00:39:02,339
away but it's still a bit early days but

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:04,170
I think are doing open by default when

00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:07,619
it comes to their new propositions and

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:10,020
that's changing the landscape as well so

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,799
it's it's early days it's new I think I

00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:17,069
was in for it right the first step is

00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:19,530
accessing through open banking banking

00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:22,260
services underneath it we do believe

00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,960
that over time that will transition into

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,089
open source banking effectively even the

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,530
banking infrastructure itself will be

00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:30,530
based on open source not the data

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,500
so there are their pockets of

00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:40,240
implementation do you distinguish

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:42,390
different sizes but it's a good question

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,390
actually

00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:51,580
so going back to Gates Foundation Bill

00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:54,580
Gates has switch the reason to push it

00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,160
right back down to those costs to enable

00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,540
financial inclusion that I got any

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,130
sensitive because we're going live in a

00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,760
few weeks or but we're about to go live

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:05,710
in Africa so it's there are projects are

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,280
now more and more Gates has gone even

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:11,140
further community and enterprise

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,080
know-it-all States community there is no

00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,910
Enterprise Edition mandate so there are

00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,740
different projects doing different

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:23,050
things and our other services that are

00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:25,000
building on top of that maturity and

00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,830
they're driven by individuals rather

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:34,210
necessarily community that's the

00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:35,080
changelings community drives it thank

00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,960
you

00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,910
I love hope open make banking 400 banked

00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,420
region you think is a mission that we

00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:45,870
should really put some alliances thank

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,890
you we're gonna thank you

00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:52,340
[Applause]
