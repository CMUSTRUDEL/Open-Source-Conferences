Title: Open Source Culture, Standards, Risks, and Remediation: A Deep Dive 2 - Jeff Luszcz Day 2 OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management, Flexera Software
Presentation: Open Source Culture, Standards, Risks, and Remediation: A Deep Dive - Part Two

The draw for financial services’ use of open source in today’s competitive environment is certainly built on the need to manage costs, but equally as important, to innovate and help solve business challenges. Implementing open source policies, processes and tools the right way could mean the difference between being a leader in the industry and costly mistakes that impact your reputation and bottom-line. In this session, Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management at Flexera, takes a deep dive into some of the common–and not so common–concerns and best practices surrounding using open source. Jeff will discuss the needs of the different open source culture types including compliance and security, how to manage commercial suppliers and compliance artifacts (third party notices, ‘About’ boxes, source bundles, etc.), and industry standards such as OpenChain and SPDX.
 
Jeff will address lessons learned from deploying software composition analysis (SCA) scanning tools across the enterprise, the importance of developing processes that enhance the value of engineers and developers versus making their jobs harder, and how legal, engineering, and security work together to develop remediation policies that make sense. Jeff will also discuss how to work best with Open Source projects in order to give back to the community. Join Jeff for this talk if you are involved in open source use, compliance and security and want an in-depth look at both the expected and unexpected issues you could face in your open source efforts.

00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,230
so what's compliance look like I always

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,700
like looking at some good examples

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,170
especially from the open source world

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,580
because this is the culture the open

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,039
source culture kind of telegraphing what

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,930
they expect so I like looking at Linux I

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,119
like looking at things like Firefox and

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,430
the open source browsers what's nice

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,660
about like Firefox is they're an open

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,340
source organization but they also have

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,380
paid lawyers they have the culture

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,090
around it and so you they do I think a

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,370
really good job they have the about box

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,350
they have the licensing information

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,420
that's very public there and they show

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,100
the information about the licensing so

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,360
if you have something like this you're

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
probably doing a pretty good job if you

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,989
don't have something like this I always

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,980
like pointing people to good examples in

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,649
the open-source world because you can

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,390
use that as a model okay source bundles

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,610
again going this is I think this is

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,960
Mozilla example as well how do they

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,149
really source bundles and I think if

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,800
you're in certain certain organizations

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,329
where you're delivering mobile apps

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,790
you're delivering containers you're

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,840
delivering virtual machines or devices

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,420
and the automotive and the kind of IOT

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,619
space delivering the source bundles is

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,090
very important I think this is a place

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,040
where people get the most heat and light

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,689
and and anger from the open-source

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,830
community is they say supposed to be

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,930
delivering this and you haven't done it

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,220
and people have to jump through hoops

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,509
and there's been a couple things around

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,770
the automotive world where people have

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,909
complained about I didn't get the right

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,369
thing and they've made a blog entry

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,409
that's then exploded in the 50 articles

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,810
you really don't want to be in that

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,060
place so if you have it if you have the

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,259
obligation to be passing on source it's

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,810
important to work with your engineering

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,700
team to say how do we get this source

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,950
put it into a bundle without mixing our

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,930
commercial code in with it you know

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,490
unless we have to and then getting it so

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,140
that it's very easy and very transparent

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,399
for our users to get it if it's too hard

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,930
you're gonna have people get confused

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,320
about whether you're actually complying

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:02,189
or not and and if it's too difficult for

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,479
you to kind of get this done ahead of

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,890
time you're gonna spend a lot of time

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,140
after the fact somebody three years five

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,970
years ten years later it says I expect

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,590
the source and these open source

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,420
projects may not even be around anymore

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,500
you might have to be using like the

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,940
Wayback Machine

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,440
the Internet Archive even try to get

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,360
close to it and it's best to try to

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,490
capture these things at component

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,590
selection time and use time save them

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,060
away so it becomes like breathing in

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,400
order to comply with this these

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,320
obligations and especially if you're

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,390
dealing with anything with GPL anything

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,220
with Linux this should be on top of your

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,510
mind because this is one of the biggest

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,160
things that people want to see

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,170
especially the authors okay some common

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,209
misunderstanding so if we're gonna be

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,010
using MIT code we can using Apache code

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,110
it's pretty straightforward we use what

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,120
we use we comply with this the things

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,489
that seem to cause the biggest legal and

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,560
engineering fights seem to be some of

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,600
the code that is not quite open source

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,670
so it's out there on the internet it's

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,350
visible code but it doesn't have an

00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,940
open-source license associated with it

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,320
or we're not quite sure if it has a

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,730
license so just because the code is

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,989
available it doesn't mean we have

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,280
permission to use this and this is some

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,750
of the biggest battles I'll see with

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,760
engineering I think we've already used

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,620
it I got it off a forum what do you want

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,989
me to do rewrite it and so this is what

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,400
I think education really can help so the

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,660
developers should understand that if

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,790
they don't see a license or they don't

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,290
get a license for that code don't even

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,730
put it in the codebase because we're

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,739
gonna you know we have 25 lines of

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,260
source code that's gonna cause 25 email

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,470
exchanges just to get this get a license

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,380
for this sort of rewrite it we see the

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,850
terms public domain used way too much in

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,650
places where it's not actually public

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,450
domain so if you hear people say public

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,160
domain I always want to explicitly

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,390
understand why are you saying that what

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,000
do you mean by this because it sometimes

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,260
uses a magic totem a magic word to say

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,480
oh it's public domain we can do anything

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,560
we want with it and then you'll look at

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,410
it's actually under the general public

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,320
license it's really important to get the

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,540
light you know the license terms correct

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,310
and there's certain hot-button terms

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,489
when I see public domain when I see

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,040
freely available when I see free code I

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,060
go yeah free I go I better go check on

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,680
this sass versus internal use I'll talk

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,000
about this in a little bit but it from

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,860
shipping code I have a lot more

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,870
obligations on the other the open-source

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,730
licenses then if I'm doing a sass site

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,350
but I'll talk about that but that

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,150
changes very quickly when we start doing

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,510
containers or private clouds and things

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,900
like that

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,900
and

00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,800
mm-hmm yeah that that is that's a that's

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,930
a thousand-dollar question I see I call

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,880
a lot of the rewrites I see people say

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,650
oh I did cleanroom development it's

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,240
really dirty room development you know

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,150
they're looking over here and they're

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,650
typing a fix over here when people have

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,210
GPL violations when they have other

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,710
license violations and developers come

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,980
back in a day and said oh I rewrote it

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,930
I'm very suspicious of that so it's very

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,930
important to give explicit instructions

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,520
on rewriting and it depends on what type

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,490
of industry you're in and how important

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,920
that code is but in general I like to

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,660
very explicitly explain to them I don't

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,210
want you just stripping copyrights and

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,040
changing variable names if it's if it's

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,600
important enough to rewrite go have

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,340
somebody who didn't have exposure to the

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,170
code tell them what the API should be

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,940
and then have them rewrite it but it's

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,270
also we have to be pragmatic if it's if

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,890
it's 15 lines of code how much cleanroom

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,840
development are we gonna do and that

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,090
starts to become a legal discussion you

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,100
know um but this also is about fixing

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,690
things after the fact we have all these

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,640
problems sometimes because people picked

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,960
things that didn't have good licenses or

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,360
they changed the license and now we have

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,140
to refactor it it's always better to do

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,430
it right the first time

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,380
but you will find that you have a

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,670
significant amount of technical debt and

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,500
things that have to be fixed because

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,870
they came in ten years ago and you find

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,970
them and you say now you know it's GPL

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,860
it's fifteen lines of code how do we how

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,890
do we rewrite it try to set up some

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,940
really clear expo expectations and then

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,800
the commercially licensed code people

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,270
say oh it's commercial it can't have any

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,250
open source in it or they would have

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,360
told us and this is this is where it

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,800
will talk about the supply chain a

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
little bit this is one of the biggest

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,730
concerns I have around vulnerabilities

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
and open source and disclosures is we

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,560
get code that comes in from from another

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,450
company it could be all open source

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,950
especially less in financial world but

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,540
even even here we saw a lot of the

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,220
presentations over the last couple days

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,380
here people saying I'm a big commercial

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,360
company here's my open source project so

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,680
it might have a commercial company's

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,060
name behind it but actually has an

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,640
open-source license maybe it's a patchy

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,160
2:04 for the Finnish world here but in

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,600
other places automotive GPL is the

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,850
culture there so I see a lot of people

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,140
saying oh it came from this company it's

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,330
automotive company and we go look at it

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,680
so GPL it's not commercial we actually

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,600
have some very strong obligations there

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,250
so another good thing to train your

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,930
developers to always ask for the license

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,340
and ask that follow-up question

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,720
is there open source are there

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,930
additional terms I have to pay attention

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,930
to

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,990
yes yes and do it right the first time

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,490
if you can but also understand that

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,560
we've been writing we've been using open

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,639
source for 20 years and it hasn't always

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,830
been on the right time so we have that

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,130
technical debt so get clean stay clean

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,570
is kind of the philosophy I like one

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,460
thing I like to always add at this point

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,320
too is around mint kind of how we modify

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,090
codes we bring in code from the outside

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,800
world and sometimes we do things that

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,509
are the right technical choice but they

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,250
cause legal and open-source compliance

00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:34,810
problems so especially in the financial

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,330
services world there's a lot of

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,770
JavaScript being used and it's gonna be

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,070
used in the web front end it's gonna be

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,020
used for our UI and developers and IT

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,090
people are gonna say let's minimize it

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,500
which basically means we take this it's

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,210
a little bit like compilation a little

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,190
different take this big JavaScript

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,110
library for a web browser and shrink it

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,330
down so it's faster so cost us less to

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,740
deliver the experience is faster maybe

00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,289
we get a little office keishon and kind

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,520
of hide some of our IP behind there but

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,979
we're doing this to the open source

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,409
libraries that may not allow it or we're

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,669
rafasa Africa emphasizing this and not

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:07,960
putting in the right copyrights and

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,159
things like this so just another thing

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,909
as you're building your policies around

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,949
the use of JavaScript be be mindful of

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,360
we have licensing obligations and then

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,729
we have kind of technical requirements

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,050
for fast and cheap downloads and they

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,729
sometimes are gonna be at odds with each

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,650
other and this might be a case where IT

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,780
and engineering and legal need to come

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,520
up with some really good policies around

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,870
what do we do with this open source and

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,720
how do we deliver and how do we modify

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,430
it to make it work the other thing I see

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,039
is people only have the minified

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,969
versions so five years later they don't

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,500
know what's really going on they don't

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,430
know what version of the code is being

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,750
used they don't know how they've

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,219
modified it they don't know if

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,390
somebody's hacked it behind the scenes

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,940
and we're starting to see more and more

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,620
supply chain attacks in JavaScript so

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,040
you don't have the original source that

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,889
you can do a

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,720
code review and a license review of

00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:54,519
you're in trouble so my best practice on

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,709
this is always preserve the original

00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,019
code even if you end up doing some sort

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,970
of transformation or modification on it

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:02,920
always try to work from the original

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,139
code do that minification as part of the

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,790
build so that you you're kind of dealing

00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:10,209
with the original IP and original files

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,560
not with some magic JavaScript that's

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,790
being passed on from generation to

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,050
generation okay so the other important

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,880
thing is understand how you're

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,779
delivering your code so the cultural

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,149
impact of are we a sass company are we a

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,730
classic distribution company are we have

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,649
mobile apps are we a company that builds

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,019
classic applications that we then give

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,269
to you know there's a terminal financial

00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,430
services terminal and all of our clients

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,490
that is running our code that's a

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,410
distribution are we now putting out

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,930
docker or we're putting out containers

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,279
this is a really big change five years

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,750
ago everybody says oh we're all software

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,980
as-a-service world we don't have to

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,690
think about licensing anymore and

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,639
license compliance and as I said before

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,709
I think we're shipping more Linux and

00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,420
more open source now in containers than

00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,190
we we shipped virtual machines or

00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,230
physical devices five ten years ago so

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,730
it's important to understand this and

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,019
it's also important for your developers

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,569
understand why you're doing this and

00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,190
that they don't overlook things it's

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,740
very common people to say oh whereas a

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,930
SAP oh except we have a mobile app for

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,269
Android and when you know Windows a one

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,750
phone in an iPhone well let's go look at

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,100
that code what's going on there or the

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,740
case I say oh we've never shipped our

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,029
code to anybody where were SAS and then

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,350
somebody on the engineering call will

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,910
raise their hands saying oh except for

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,220
so-and-so we made them a private cloud

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,240
version and they took all the code that

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,339
they thought was never going to be

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,569
distributed including all this GPL and

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,980
other things that they've been passed to

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,709
the biggest client and biggest customer

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,000
in a private cloud or a private

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,079
on-premises version so it's important to

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,819
understand that also understand that

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,290
your business model can change overnight

00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,000
especially when you have a large

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,980
customer a large client who's gonna say

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,569
our data never leaves our network

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,370
therefore you better you better put it

00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,740
here the other thing I think is still

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,170
being decided on is still being argued

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,180
about is what about things like cloud

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,939
provider providers like Amazon or a

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,740
juror I have my private cloud version

00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:01,030
here can you run it there so it's

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,650
running on Amazon and it's

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,810
paid for by a client is that a

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,460
distribution I my traditional view would

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,750
be yes that's that probably should be

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,610
seen as a distribution we should be

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,650
paying attention that way some people

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,850
will argue about about that I think it's

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,110
important to understand and surface

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:34,270
those issues and then have your legal

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:47,280
team kind of figure it out when you need

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:50,410
proximity to the technical the technical

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,720
solution sometimes is it odds with what

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,430
we think is the compliance side I also

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,900
like having drawing these slides when I

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,820
work with my engineering teams and I go

00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,560
work with my clients I like drawing them

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,090
very whiteboard or an active person say

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,210
let's draw out the architecture here

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,220
let's go from bare metal to the firmware

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,560
to the operating system to the client

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,270
things to where our app leaves and are

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
there probably multiple versions of this

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:16,450
box oh we got our license system over

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,240
here we have our car database over here

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,530
we have this we have that and understand

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,870
that your licensing world is gonna

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,120
change you know pry from this level down

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,560
it's all gonna be GPL and you should be

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,060
happy to be using GPL there you should

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,860
be expecting to provide all the

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,000
obligations there apply in the middle

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,830
level here you're gonna find different

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,560
licenses maybe maybe a mixture of

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,960
copyleft and attribution then up and up

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,360
in your application is gonna be all

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,710
commercial call your stuff plus the open

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,820
source that you bring in and probably if

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,860
you're a commercial organization you

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,930
might trend more toward the permissive

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,790
licenses versus the copyleft licenses

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,920
but understanding this thing especially

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,850
if you're in IOT or automotive you're

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,470
gonna have a much more complicated

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,240
system but as we see as they see

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,000
financial services talk more about

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,830
containers containers containers this is

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,810
that's basically as somebody said

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,490
containers or Linux basically the heart

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,110
of the containers is a lot of the GPL

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,610
license code and at what I see

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,900
developers doing more and more as the

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,390
saying oh it's I'm gonna treat it as a

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,630
black box in a mix my code your code etc

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,220
and I think the GPL compliance is

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,390
becoming you

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,550
important as we start to look at that

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,290
distribution model there in drawing out

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,790
this box and the architecture diagram is

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,560
very helpful and don't neglect

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,390
especially with the GDP our and the

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,160
other privacy issues to think about

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,680
where are you calling out through Web

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,060
Services REST API is etc whether it's

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
your own company or outside of the

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,360
company that's often overlooked as a

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,100
third party issue since it's not quite

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,470
source code but it's a place where your

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,470
data especially the PII comes and goes

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,410
from from a perspective of the ownership

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,290
I think sometimes you'll see the stacks

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,720
have different owners IT traditionally

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,730
manage your infrastructure not maybe not

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,380
development oriented not legal license

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,210
oriented etc it's really about nuts and

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,580
bolts of keeping the devices on or the

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,800
the cloud services up your development

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,210
team really understands the product if

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,100
the product that you built you know kind

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,630
of executable that then runs on this IT

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,980
infrastructure and they have different

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,680
management cycles they have different

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,320
understanding of the legalities IT might

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,240
just be thinking about you know

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,410
vulnerabilities and payments your team

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,570
is gonna be thinking maybe about lysa

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,040
open-source licenses and vulnerabilities

00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,040
but from a different perspective and if

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,770
we go back to here the IT team might

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,420
think maybe this layer down your

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,700
development team thinks maybe this layer

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,960
up but if you if you only listen to half

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,160
of that conversation you're gonna hear

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,990
oh yeah we're doing all the patching

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,430
well maybe they're doing the patching

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,690
down here at the Linux kernel and

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,580
whatnot but they're neglecting all the

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,810
patching up here and vice versa and I

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,190
think this is how companies are getting

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,170
you know finding themselves in trouble

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,880
because their their patch management

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,530
world and their IT vulnerability

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,510
management world doesn't cross the

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,380
development side and the IT

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,380
infrastructure side

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,549
[Music]

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,680
yeah and I think we're you know we're

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,360
starting to see concern about supply

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,520
chain attacks both hardware and software

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,840
there's a little out of scope of this as

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,660
well but I think part of this is this is

00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,280
an IT asset problem what open source

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,930
libraries are we're using what physical

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,370
resources are we using where did they

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,300
come from who touch them along the way

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,730
and I think especially the financial

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,320
services organizations the the

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,990
protection of the entire supply chain

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,120
from physical devices to software IT

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,600
infrastructure to to source code itself

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,860
is gonna be extremely important so let's

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,510
um I'm gonna pass across some of these

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,980
Linux areas here but think about this

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,900
around the container world there's

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,760
certain things if you're using it it was

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,150
mentioned in the back before about

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,800
there's certain organizations and people

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,870
who are doing a lot of enforcement they

00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,100
expect their code to be open they expect

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,780
you as a large billion-dollar Iraq

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,340
organization with many lawyers to

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,700
understand what the obligations are and

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,050
why aren't you doing it so things like

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,980
you know if you're using a Linux kernel

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,650
and you're shipping it you're you

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,820
shipping busybox which is a component

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,020
out there the IP tables IP chains others

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,310
the expectation is you should know what

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,810
you're doing and these are the kind of

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,820
proof points when people are looking at

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,380
Linux and containers and saying are

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
there's this organization doing the

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,320
right compliance they'll go check and

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,760
say are they even telling me that

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,650
they're using the Linux kernel they even

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,950
telling me that they're using you know

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,550
busybox and if not I don't have to do it

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,350
my job's done

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,060
they're not complying and therefore I'm

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,010
gonna send them a note or a nasty gram

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,020
and also these are good tests for you

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,370
internally where are we shipping Linux

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,200
where are we shipping containers are we

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,630
are we even thinking about compliance

00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,040
documents etc we haven't even talked

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,780
about the vulnerability management very

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,010
well so I mean to skip that so let's

00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,050
talk about the places where we get

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,060
started so there's a lot of technical

00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,440
debt there's we can't boil the ocean I

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,150
think a lot of people get to this place

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,980
where they get analysis paralysis or if

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,630
I can't do it all we can't even get

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,459
started so I'm gonna recommend some

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,900
places where to get started here so you

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,490
go back to your organization and you say

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,439
let's start thinking about especially

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,000
the financial services world what do we

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,439
have where can we get started where can

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,290
we get some quick wins in terms of

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,580
compliance and security so first off if

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,320
we're using Linux anyway

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,970
for shipping Linux if we're building

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,430
terminals and we're distributing it to

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,640
our our partners we should really have a

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,560
good plan around Linux compliance it at

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,720
least at least the baby steps around

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,460
that we're shipping physical devices if

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,350
we're shipping virtual machines we're

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,760
stripping containers let's start that

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,930
discussion about what does GPL

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,420
compliance look like for us in the

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,640
financial services world they're

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,910
back cryptographic components the the

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,080
classic here is open SSL recently about

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,280
a month ago there was the the Lib SSH

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,050
vulnerability that came out as well

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,550
this happens all the time it's there's

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,780
it's not that they're bad components

00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,760
it's just that everybody knows that

00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,110
they're the underpinnings of the

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,010
financial services world and the

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,660
internet so if I attack crypto I can get

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,130
in and I know that it's ubiquitous I

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,750
know it's everywhere there so start

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,780
there what are what ins of open SSL

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,940
we're using live SSH OpenSSH whatever

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,100
we're using let's figure it out and odds

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,900
are you're gonna have multiple copies in

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,780
a single application open SSL I

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,670
typically see four five six seven

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,350
different versions from different supply

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,450
chains that are coming into your single

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,670
application so don't stop at the first

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,410
one figure out where all your versions

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,020
are coming from and also use that as a

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,520
little bit of a a weapon for your your

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,780
vendors to have them get their act

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,450
together you're gonna find that you're

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,860
getting a lot of old crypto from both

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,910
your open source vendors and your

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,100
commercial vendors that they haven't

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,870
updated in five years since since the

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,150
heartbleed attack came out so use that

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,740
as a great test and also just helps you

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,350
put them on notice that you're paying

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,960
attention to these things

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,450
compression components so z lib and and

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,820
others are often have some security

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,650
issues they're also just very visible so

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,510
if I come in and I look and I say let's

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,160
go see where good old Z live is like the

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,470
classic proof point it's kind of like

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,980
vanilla it's everywhere we're gonna see

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,950
it everywhere

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,300
expect it's there what's the version we

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,030
have the license and if it's not there

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,620
again it's a great bellwether test to

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,180
say they're not following anything and

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,920
it also has some known vulnerabilities

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,570
so if I if I cyan't find the older

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,950
versions it's a great way to say if

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,720
they're not even fixing the zeal of

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,180
owner ability they haven't been keeping

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,020
track of anything else

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,570
Multimedia components so if you're

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,010
slinging audio or video we start to see

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,730
this now more where people saying you

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,010
know push

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,600
button to talk to somebody on demand or

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,870
I'm gonna play some video things like

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,550
that again very very targeted have some

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,520
known vulnerabilities also might have

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,980
some patent and IP issues out there and

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,710
then the application platforms so if

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,730
you're on Java you're probably targeting

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,160
Tomcat you're probably targeting

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,340
something like JBoss if I'm on NPM I

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
have the NPM system again great test if

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,320
we haven't even applied with the heart

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,910
of our system

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,000
we're not complying anywhere else and

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,580
this is a great way to get some quick

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,290
hits in terms of security from both your

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,620
internal teams and your vendors if our

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,790
version of Tomcat is two years old we

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,890
probably have some security issues and

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,210
and and there's reasons why these some

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,670
of these things don't get updated is

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,050
because there's there's sometimes

00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,790
compatibility issues ah they fixed the

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,800
bug but by fixing the bug I have to

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,960
update to virt you know two versions

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,430
newer and it breaks all my old legacy

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,370
code and so I can't do that and so

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,560
there's this trade-off of rework for

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,540
fixing compatibility issues versus

00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,010
closing up security holes and I think

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,930
very often this becomes the engineering

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,790
debate and so sometimes we need to come

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,020
in and put some more pressure on there

00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,340
to say yes we need more time in the

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,870
roadmap to deal with these things it

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,940
can't be all new features all the time

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,530
sometimes we have to do you know

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,570
strengthen and you know make our

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,700
infrastructure more resilient the last

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,410
one here is databases this is a great

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,410
test when I talk to somebody says do use

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,570
open source no well what's your database

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,490
oh we're using my sequel it's a great a

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,870
great test that kind of helps it helps

00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,490
you understand what's their knowledge of

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,840
open source and licensing and it's one

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,760
of the first questions I'll ask when I'm

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,310
kind of testing a team to see where it

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,590
where they are at databases have a lot

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:11,120
of strong licensing we've seen the a GPL

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,260
with the MongoDB we've seen that with

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,470
some of the new license changes with

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,480
with like Redis and and some of the no

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,020
sequel databases I wouldn't expect over

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,880
the next year or so to see that expect a

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,860
lot more changes out there so people are

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,080
looking for business models and they see

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,700
especially financial services saying you

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,920
know hey we use a lot of this therefore

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,250
it's a good it's a good proof point it's

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,900
also another way to know how what are

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,400
kind of the extents of your system

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,930
so where's your system running oh we

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,650
have a database over here we have a

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,510
queue

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,160
over here we have an identity system

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,930
over here you're gonna find that your

00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,430
system is a lot more complicated than

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,660
just you know a classic application

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:53,310
running on a single device okay so I

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,370
have a great list of questions here that

00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:58,230
I find very eye-opening I have I have

00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,730
these printed out also later if people

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,560
are interested I have a version of this

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,350
but it's some great questions that kind

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,000
of start the conversation so you know do

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,520
we have a list of open source we have a

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,770
bill of materials go look at it if it's

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,200
a couple dozen items you know add two

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,060
zeros to your total content there if

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,190
they can't produce that list within an

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:20,070
hour there isn't a list is my general

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,510
rule and and how deep have we looked and

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,370
how complete is it sometimes people are

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,860
run a tool say oh here's our here's our

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,970
list but they just ran it an hour ago

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,860
they've never run it before they've

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,300
never they've never been self-reflective

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,250
on this list and the licenses and the

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,600
vulnerabilities so how complete is it

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,100
did you just build it because I asked

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,470
for it or do we keep this as part of our

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,450
engineering practices as I talked about

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,100
before crypto compression multimedia

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,930
look for those those are the hot-button

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,870
issues go look at the version of open

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,640
SSL you're using how many years old is

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,140
it that's a great sign if it hasn't been

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,530
updated in years nothing else has been

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,960
updated ask pointed questions about

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,670
repository managers everybody should

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,770
know what repository managers they're

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:03,300
using and where maven NPM new get these

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,720
are the classic ones we can talk more

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,180
about that later but these pull in code

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,440
and you will not see that code that

00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,580
you'll not see that open source code in

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,350
your source code management system

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,120
you'll see references to it and you'll

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,490
see the configuration files but that

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,200
code does not get pulled down until

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,060
build time and that's a very common

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,740
compliance problem somebody will take

00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,990
the source code system they'll run a

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,790
grep they'll run a license scanner tool

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,860
and they'll miss all the stuff that's

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,150
actually there at Build time so strong

00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,190
recommendation to look both at your

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,720
input and your output to kind of pay

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,020
attention to what's being brought in by

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,760
the the repository managers web services

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,330
including things like credit card

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,380
processors GIS and geographic lookups

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,680
these are things that often get

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,360
overlooked and they sometimes they work

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,340
in development because you're making 20

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,080
calls a day 250 calls a day but then you

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,360
push something to production a million

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,380
calls a day to some service that

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,210
no clue that you were gonna be calling

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,780
onto it it can lead to a problem it's

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,060
also a place where your dad is leaving

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:05,970
databases virtual machines component

00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,140
containers that full stack is very

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,540
important we showed it before

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,580
and then lastly do we have a disclosure

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,140
list from our commercial vendors and you

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,900
have a excellent opportunity whenever

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,880
you buy saw for somebody whenever it's

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,800
time for contract renewal time or even

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,590
just in general perfect time to go to

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,570
your vendor and say I'm doing all this

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,550
where's where's your equivalent what's

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,180
what's this culture if you're not

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,620
familiar with the opens OpenStack

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:36,120
organization is very important to kind

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:38,760
of get that kind of that culture of our

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,940
open chain the the culture of software

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,230
supply chain working for you so ask them

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,400
for their disclosure list what open

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,320
source are you giving to me what

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,330
commercial code are you giving to me I'm

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,670
seeing an interesting kind of Filth

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,070
philosophical debate here and I fall on

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,150
one side which is tell me all the open

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,320
source and all the commercial codes

00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,640
you're using I want to know that you're

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,870
tracking your inventory I want to know

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,860
that you're tracking the vulnerabilities

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,090
and licenses even if you're not legally

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,190
complied to give me that disclosure list

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,360
I want to know I want to know what

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,340
you're using I want to know what your

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,960
dependencies are and I also give you the

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,850
internal pressure that you can build

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,100
your systems you know with with the with

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,170
the pressure from your clients people

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,520
get better and it also allows you when

00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,280
you're trying to defend why you're

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,810
building security lists and Bill of

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,370
Materials be able to point and say well

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,680
our vendors are expecting this now and

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,150
and it's good for you as well as a

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,950
vendor get that into your contract if

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,420
you can and you might have that already

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,620
might say you're going to give us a list

00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,550
of all the open source you know your

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,550
most list so the commercial

00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:45,080
yeah I think that's an internal internal

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,239
policy question i i'm a general believer

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,249
of if i have if i have open source

00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:51,200
licenses and i then end up shipping it I

00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:53,779
should probably be registering you know

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,859
it's as if I picked it that's that's my

00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,720
philosophy if you're not doing a

00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:58,039
distribution I think that's gonna be

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,619
about a classic question for your

00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,480
internal policy tracking I like keeping

00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:12,379
track of everything so when the struts

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:15,109
comes out I know where I'm using it so

00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:16,460
let me I'll get right to that because

00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:19,460
that's the perfect perfect segue for

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,600
this so I got maybe in the interest of

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,789
time I'm gonna skip some of these

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,200
commercial commercial compliance issues

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,749
and we'll get right to that SAS the SAS

00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,710
question here but in general this we

00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:32,269
talked about here put the buck stops

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,889
with you if you get code and you ship it

00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:35,690
you're responsible for everything you

00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:38,450
ship if you're able to kind of almost

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,249
outsource correctly the compliance and

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,139
security tasks your vendor put the

00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:43,609
pressure on them what happens too many

00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:45,649
times is you get a phone call that says

00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:47,840
I need to know all the open sources

00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:49,609
you're using right now and if your

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,769
supply chain hasn't passed this on to

00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:54,169
you you end up having to do an audit for

00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,789
them so have have your commercial

00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,470
companies provide you this list of

00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:59,989
disclosures and whatnot so then you can

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,600
just pass it on as your earlier question

00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:03,830
on to your on to your end-users and also

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,710
do your security team and things like

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:11,359
that one recommendation I'd have here is

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:13,340
use those kind of kind of the dirty

00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,989
dozen of components you know how many

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,850
open SSL's can you find how many easy

00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:17,960
lab so many Tomcats and use that as

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,119
pressure back on your supply chain

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,609
saying hey i ran a scan or I did a quick

00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,679
visual inspection and your Tomcats two

00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,960
years old your open SSL is nine months

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,399
old and someone's on unacceptable you

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,739
know I want you to do better

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,059
so the naval the next cycle through

00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:37,730
hopefully do a better job for you let me

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,529
let me skip this here and let's just get

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,769
to the kind of commercial components and

00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:43,700
then the kind of sass issues here so

00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:46,039
your commercial code that you're getting

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,599
might be in binary form so it may be

00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,940
very difficult for you to deal with it

00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,620
and my general advice is you probably

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,059
should not be trying to reverse an

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,970
and do a deep dive on your

00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,309
your-your-your kind of supplier code

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,170
outside of the trying to find those

00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,210
bellwether things to kind of point and

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,680
say you need to do a better job you may

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,970
be forced to you know you might be

00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,590
getting a compliance letter or a

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,020
customer obligation that says in a week

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,870
we need this for to close the sale but

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,460
in general try to push that out set that

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:18,020
contractual standard for the disclosure

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:20,000
levels and if you're getting Linux both

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,370
for internal use and external use I see

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,350
a lot of time that there's this we'll

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,630
see the words all you know in a lot of

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,340
contract terms disclose all open source

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:31,280
disclose all licenses and you're

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,440
shipping a copy of Linux that that can

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,420
be very very very difficult to comply

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,850
with and this also leads to sometimes

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,500
this like arguments about well if we

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,690
can't do it should we be doing it at all

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,890
or well if we can't do it for Linux then

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,570
for we don't have to do it for own

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,860
products so I think it's important to

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,750
kind of understand what this link

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,250
whatever language that you were under

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,130
effect and also let your putting your

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,290
vendors in so if if something says all

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:57,320
try to do you know obviously as best as

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,970
you can but all this you can try to pick

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,860
a select a vendor for Linux or whatnot

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,080
that can pass that on to you you you

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,730
know if the Linux vendors having

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,140
difficult doing compliance for the

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,580
operating system you're probably not

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,720
going to do any better than the people

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,410
who are the experts in their operating

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,220
system so let's talk about SAS now so

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,730
what's different about SAS so

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,130
traditionally if we distributed code the

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,750
license obligations came into effect if

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,420
we're on SAS we're not actually doing a

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:25,280
distribution well do we need to track it

00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,510
from a license perspective a lot of

00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,429
people five years ago we're saying

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,170
hallelujah we don't have to worry about

00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:33,290
compliance anymore outside of certain

00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:35,750
things it just put it in you know ship

00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,340
it or don't ship it put it out on the

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,850
web and we're good

00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,830
that was very license oriented I think

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,660
what heartbleed and then the struts to

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,520
vulnerability showed us is if we don't

00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,929
have a bill of materials we don't know

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,850
what vulnerabilities are gonna affect us

00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:51,140
and the time scales involved in us

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,450
trying to figure out do we have struts

00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,250
do we have open SSL those timescales are

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,290
too short for us to be able to discover

00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,940
it and put a remediation in place before

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:02,030
kind of the outside scripts are able to

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,620
discover it before us so my general

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,730
philosophy is we should be having a bill

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,510
of materials for anything we're using

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,760
primarily

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,460
for security purposes but also because

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,700
business models change so what's what

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,140
SAS today is an on-premises distribution

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,790
for your biggest customer tomorrow or

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,800
somebody wrapped it in container for a

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,090
private cloud and passes it on and all

00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,200
the choices that people made because

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,190
they said oh we don't have to worry

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,710
about it cuz we're never shipping it

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,990
come and bite you later on so keep that

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,460
in mind maybe sometimes think about that

00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,950
you may always be doing a distribution

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,500
in the future and make a choice based on

00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:36,350
but perhaps future compliance versus

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:39,440
current compliance be aware of the

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:42,410
affero GPL that is the the main license

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,690
that is probably people are gonna ask

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,760
you about in terms of your SAS

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,080
compliance and that a pharoah GPL is

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,760
basically a license that says if you're

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
providing a network service and you're

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,300
doing a certain things behind the scenes

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:58,340
you might be required to provide source

00:30:53,300 --> 00:31:00,170
code to your to your users in the second

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:07,360
a little bit I'll talk about where that

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:10,280
where that comes into a play just here

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,710
so talk about the a GPL term you might

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,960
hear is the ASP loophole which is when

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,730
people talk about talk about the a GPL

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,520
and what that meant is hey if we're not

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,930
distributing code we don't need to prove

00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,190
do any open source compliance the open

00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,080
source world said wait a second that's

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,300
not the philosophy open source and so

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,640
they created the a GPL as one of the

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,870
first kind of licenses to say you know

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,460
what we think you should be providing

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,350
source code in attribution to your to

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,210
your products so the idea was to close

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,020
that loophole for you know people who

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,920
are doing SAS vendors there's some

00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,350
libraries that you're probably gonna

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,970
come across that are a GPL licensed I

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,480
text is probably the one that's most

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,860
common for people MongoDB is also

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,770
extremely common in financial services

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,530
so I Texas for generating PDFs MongoDB

00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,870
is basically a database a couple of the

00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,960
others Berkeley DB funnel ball go script

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,200
neo4j and Magento these are fairly

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,060
common libraries in certain areas but

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,250
you'll notice that there many of them

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,550
are dual licensed so people are using

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:12,500
this strong copyleft license kind of as

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,060
a carrot and stick for a business model

00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,160
so if you're in the pure open-source we

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,930
could just use it under the a GPL most

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,450
people in the room are probably using it

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,610
for commercial

00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,050
purposes they don't want to perhaps be

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,180
under the effect of this a GPL or

00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,470
potentially a GPL so purchase a

00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,400
commercial license I'm just treat it

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,740
like a commercial a license library that

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,140
is I think that's been the culture of a

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,560
GPL recently has been it's been as dual

00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,290
license culture as opposed to a sure

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:42,360
philosophical a GPL culture of giving

00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,380
you know other options I don't know if

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,870
that's gonna change or not but we're

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,740
starting to see especially like I said

00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,550
before the kind of the well-funded

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,810
database companies and things like that

00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,610
who are looking for a business model

00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,590
change or they're trying to you know get

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,390
more revenue are definitely starting to

00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,100
look at license changes especially

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,430
around making this more of a strong

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,820
carrot and stick to get people to pay

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,500
okay

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,260
so what are some of the top concerns for

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,430
SAS compliance so number one is the

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,320
library vulnerability problem kind of

00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,050
the struts to issue right now that is

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,280
where I think you're gonna get the most

00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,720
support internally when you're starting

00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,460
to say I need to start paying attention

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,660
to open source licensing I need to start

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,730
paying attention to open source

00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,130
vulnerabilities that idea of we're gonna

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,290
build a bill of materials and the

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,910
purpose there is so we can track

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,560
vulnerabilities what's a great side

00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,180
effect is we know everything we're using

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,410
we know the licenses and we can start

00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,420
paying attention to things that may or

00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:36,540
may not be acceptable for the for our

00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:40,620
compliance purposes pay attention to a

00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,850
GPL is there the reason why I think a

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,260
lot of people get concerned about this

00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,940
is first off it's because there's dual

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,710
licensing yes commercial companies

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,720
behind it who want I want their license

00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,280
revenue but also your clients are gonna

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,830
be asking so if they're gonna ask you

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,870
about any open source issue in the SAS

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,860
world it's gonna be around a GPL you

00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,480
know they're gonna ask that explicit

00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,120
question and you want an instant answer

00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,830
we don't use a GPL or we use this

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,060
library where we've paid the commercial

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,520
option for it and it should be an

00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,600
instant response there's a couple other

00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,610
licenses that are out there that are

00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,200
like the a GPL so the common public

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,420
attribution license and the open

00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,610
software license you don't see them very

00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:17,010
often they're out there so you should be

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,930
aware of them and if your building

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,700
policy you should make sure you

00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:23,250
explicitly have that because just one of

00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,450
those becomes a remediation problem if

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,760
you're not going to be able to use it

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,040
later on and again you might you might

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,440
find a single library that's brought out

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,109
there but it's a it's a reason to really

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,220
have your engineers

00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:35,619
understand what your whitelist and your

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,029
blacklist is for certain things so what

00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:38,259
are some other things as people often

00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:39,639
say if we don't ship it we don't have to

00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:41,589
worry about compliance and I think

00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,809
that's kind of a very narrow view of it

00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:45,909
if you're using a commercial database

00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:47,769
from well-known commercial companies and

00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,269
you're not shipping it I think they

00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:51,399
still want their their license revenue

00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,509
so we should be commercial components

00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,799
and commercial dependencies are

00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:55,899
obviously very important for us to

00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:57,539
understand what we're using the

00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:59,470
components marked not for commercial use

00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:00,730
though they're not talking about

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,259
distribution they're talking about

00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,339
commercial use or not use so you should

00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:06,489
really understand where that's being

00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:08,650
used restrictions on type of use so no

00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:10,059
military use none you know in the US

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,619
there's been certain things around

00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:13,269
imitate people are working with the

00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,980
Immigration Department and there was a

00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:16,720
earlier in the year there was a license

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,829
that was changed it says if you're one

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,420
of these companies you're not allowed to

00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:20,410
use this library anymore because you're

00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,660
working with the government on

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,859
immigration issues so be aware of that

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,150
especially if you're not particularly

00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:32,859
sensitive area military use certain

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:34,269
certain legal users and so on and so on

00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:37,900
just understand that people might be

00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:39,700
like writing licenses around you the web

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,230
attribution licenses this is one of the

00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,299
more annoying ones kind of like the

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,920
vanity licenses we often will see this

00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:46,809
it says if you use this JavaScript

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,299
component put a link on your home page

00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:50,920
and if you're a major financial

00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:52,450
organization you're probably not going

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,819
to put a link on your home page this

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,799
one-off thing but you're using it and so

00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,390
it's important to understand those and

00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:09,839
and kind of clean out kind of the

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:12,160
compliance issues there and yeah I I a

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,849
couple years so a couple years ago there

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,380
was a license that was around the NATO

00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:20,499
who was perceived as the NATO invert

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,749
invasion of Serbia and Kosovo so there

00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:25,239
was a license I said if you were if you

00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:28,690
were a NATO country and you were in your

00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:30,339
country it was involved with the Serbia

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,940
and what not you're not allowed to use

00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,940
this component

00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:49,630
oh yes yeah so I've seen this with

00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,339
export control issues so predict

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,380
traditionally around crypto and export

00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:56,019
control is where that traditionally will

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,970
come up I have seen this some kid some

00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:00,099
issues it's usually one-off where a

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,450
library comes in and just for whatever

00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:03,309
reason somebody looks at the email

00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,559
address and it's coming from a certain

00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,970
country and they go wait a second you

00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,259
know if it was a gmail account

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,339
they wouldn't have probably been aware

00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,690
of it but they saw that it was coming

00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:12,249
from a certain country that they're not

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,019
allowed to work with that was how they

00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:15,240
found it but it was very ad hoc and it

00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,869
was very dependent on people

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,579
understanding what those restrictions

00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:20,789
are but that's a great thing to tell

00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:23,950
your team we don't want code from X Y Z

00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:25,690
maybe do a search on email addresses and

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,609
URLs and things like that which is often

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,029
a common common way that people identify

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,039
where code is not that I've seen outside

00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,940
of export control automotive definitely

00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,400
has to pay attention this because

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,200
they're actually building devices that

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,880
get shipped to countries so you see that

00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:44,739
and then perhaps in the US we have like

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,420
some of these ITAR regulations in terms

00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:48,549
of like if you're doing aerospace and

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,779
and rocketry you're gonna have to pay

00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:51,519
attention to where your code comes from

00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:54,489
and goes as well but those are very very

00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,249
big very specific okay and then

00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:58,690
components with unknown license terms

00:37:56,249 --> 00:38:00,339
pretty common I'm gonna say about 10% of

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,859
your code base you don't currently have

00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:04,359
a license go look at it the author never

00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:06,970
put out a license so you don't quite

00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,349
know what those terms are and probably

00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,579
half the time if you go talk to the

00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:11,349
author and you say can we have this

00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,029
under an MIT license or Apache 200

00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:17,230
license they'll apply and say of course

00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:19,029
you can but a it's not guaranteed B they

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,650
might look and say well great you know

00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:22,180
look at look whose e-mail address is

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,829
emailing me this maybe this is a perfect

00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,089
opportunity for commercial or maybe

00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:26,739
they're dead maybe they're long gone

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:27,999
maybe they're not allowed to reply

00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,230
because you're now working for a

00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:31,539
competitor and vice versa

00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,650
so again do it right the first time but

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,170
also understand if you don't have a

00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,640
license even in the SAS world that might

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,630
be something that's a compliance concern

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,349
for you other things

00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,819
images icons ions thoughts these are

00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:46,900
things that people are very good at

00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:48,460
recognizing on the web

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,140
you know Seiko hey those are the icons

00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,119
from Apple hey those are the sounds from

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,410
this game your developers may have done

00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,609
it as an easter egg or they didn't quite

00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,799
understand that these things have

00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:00,010
licenses just like your source code does

00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:01,660
and people are really good at you don't

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,150
need a scanner to go hey that's the same

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,619
sound as the XYZ game or that's that

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:10,329
that's the you know the gmail logo etc

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,500
JavaScript and CSS this is something

00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:13,359
where people can literally do a view

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,950
source and different companies have

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,690
different policies about JavaScript is

00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:20,339
that seen as a distribution is it not

00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:23,650
seen as a distribution is it seen as a

00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,400
embarassment issue things like that so

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,700
that's something we need to pay

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,569
attention to do a view source see what's

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:33,640
going on patent licenses probably less

00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,799
gonna affect us here in the in the

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,910
financial services term but something we

00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:38,619
need to pay attention and I've talked

00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,529
about the private installations etc a

00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:45,099
bunch of times how we doing on how we

00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:56,520
doing on time okay great

00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:56,520
up so one more minute somebody yes yes

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,940
definitely definitely so I'll finish up

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,369
here with kind of the remediation world

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,569
so you're gonna do some scanning you're

00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,799
gonna do some discussions with your

00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:13,119
developers you're gonna find a whole

00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:14,650
bunch of stuff that you shouldn't be

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,299
using and this is where I see that

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,529
paralysis comes in people said oh they

00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:19,420
told us we should just build a bill of

00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:20,829
materials now we found stuff because of

00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,710
our technical debt now what do we do

00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:25,210
with that some of its relatively

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,249
straightforward you know you remove it

00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:30,660
and you rewrite it that's that's the

00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:33,190
most common license fix that's out there

00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,710
you know so remove it remove the feature

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,819
you know you don't fix it fix it over

00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,259
the next couple months things like that

00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:39,999
this is actually some risks and

00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:43,529
drawbacks first off is you lose lose

00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:45,430
functionality and you lose time but the

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:47,170
contras story to that is you're using

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,569
somebody else's code in breaking their

00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,839
license that dirty room reimplementation

00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:53,980
x' we talked about before it can be very

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,989
developers can be very enthusiastic

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,789
about rewriting it but is it really

00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:59,440
really a rewrite and the new codes

00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,670
license may be no better I see so many

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,739
people say oh we got rid of this because

00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,239
it's GPL and they come back and they

00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:06,460
come back with a story for something

00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,480
that says not for commercial use so when

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,009
we remove something it's really

00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,900
important that we pay attention to what

00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:13,569
the new licenses and are we are we

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,009
actually fixing the problem this is very

00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:16,569
common during merger and acquisitions

00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:18,489
that people say we got to fix this ASAP

00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:20,289
smaller company is being bought by a

00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:22,480
larger company has like a real license

00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:23,920
policy and they want the they want the

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:31,059
business to continue so they got to fix

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:32,440
this real quick I don't know if I think

00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,789
a change in control I'm not a lawyer I

00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,009
think change of control is not seen as a

00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:38,349
distribution but I think M&A is an

00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:42,119
excellent time to use the power of the

00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:44,230
M&A process to fix things internally and

00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,630
you also are going to be have seen as a

00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,220
bigger target when you buy something

00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,470
last two things here so how are what

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,819
else ask the author for a real license

00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,890
this is extremely common that people

00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:55,029
know if it's big enough you say man

00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,140
there's this new one there's no other

00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:59,289
option out there

00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,640
oh yeah ask for a real license so would

00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:02,859
you be willing to give this under an

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,329
Apache 200 license could we pay you

00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:08,170
something for this maybe offer something

00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:10,119
this is often done through an

00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,270
intermediary maybe your outside legal so

00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,860
it doesn't have your big

00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,300
trillion-dollar company's name

00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,710
associated with it you know I have I'm a

00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,090
lawyer I'm not a lawyer but I'm a lawyer

00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,440
and I have a client who'd like to use

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,850
this but they would like to use it under

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,280
Apache - oh can they do that

00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:24,290
sure you know half the time they'll say

00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,700
sure certain organization things like

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,080
Linux you can't do that you can't rely

00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,960
since Linux you have to understand the

00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,680
culture the author may now want a strong

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,940
relations

00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,860
ya know GPL a Ferro or a million dollars

00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,600
and sometimes the license is longer than

00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,040
the code you're using 15 lines of

00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,480
JavaScript and you go reach out to the

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,130
original author and they say great

00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,540
here's this big license now you got to

00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,030
deal with that I think it's required

00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:49,520
it's part of the bookkeeping of doing

00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,800
this but you need to pay attention and

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,880
then I think I don't like this but this

00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,470
is what I think a lot of companies end

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,900
up doing which is they wait and see they

00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,920
find that something's bad and they let

00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,210
it sit there and they see if a problem

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,600
occurs and then they deal with it after

00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:04,370
the fact this is common for Verte for

00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,630
very old code you know code that's 20

00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,240
years old and we haven't had a problem

00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:11,180
in 20 years and for very risk tolerant

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,710
organizations I think in some ways this

00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,140
is also probably very realistic it's

00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:17,090
probably what's happening anyway I don't

00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,890
like the wait-and-see attitude I don't

00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,420
think it's legal I don't think it's I

00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,910
don't think it's always appropriate but

00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,110
it's also maybe reality it's what's

00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,640
happening behind the scenes of you if we

00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,190
didn't discover it so what are the risks

00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,920
copyright infringement license problem

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,300
if forced to comply and then lastly you

00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,480
can't properly disclose your open source

00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,950
licenses it's there your customers can

00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,750
see it's there you look in the about box

00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,950
and something's missing and this is this

00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,440
is something where I think internally

00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,240
people find themselves sometimes under a

00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,860
lot of political pressure part of the

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,030
organization is saying yeah we well we

00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,590
can't fix it the other part of the
