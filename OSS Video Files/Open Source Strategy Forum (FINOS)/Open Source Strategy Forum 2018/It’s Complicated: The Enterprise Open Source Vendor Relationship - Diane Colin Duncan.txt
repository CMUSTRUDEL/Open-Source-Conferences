Title: It’s Complicated: The Enterprise Open Source Vendor Relationship

The Buyer (Credit Suisse – Duncan Lawie)
Companies have complex compliance and regulatory processes that have to be observed and many commercial vendors have built their enterprise engagement model around meeting these needs. Today, the cutting edge technologies are almost all being developed as Open Source projects. While you want to take advantage of new technologies, you need to balance your risks, ensure that there’s ongoing support and maintenance delivered – where does that leave agility and Open Source?
 
The Developer (GrokOpen – Colin Charles)
Your popular OSS project gets corporate-backing & widespread community adoption. You create an enterprise supported version as it’s easier to sell an “enterprise spin-off with support” that is better than the currently “stable” community edition. It flourishes as the money starts rolling in. Is one version better than the other? The community gets annoyed but you need resources to keep the releases coming and the code maintained. Just because it’s open source doesn’t mean it’s free. Forking happens. Rewind.
What works? What doesn’t work? How do you manage the split personality nature well to keep management as well as the community happy. Learn from other successful models as well as the many failed experiments.
 
The Vendor (Red Hat – Diane Mueller)
You’ve packaged up an enterprise version of a popular open source project perhaps it’s one that your organization initially created or did major contributions too. You offer support, you continue to sponsor and put resources into the community version. Are you competing against yourself? How do you show the value of your enterprise version to the buyers without disenfranchising the community? How do you learn to work with competitors who are collaborators? How do you create a collaborative communities with developers both upstream and downstream?

00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,470
now in my opinion the fact of something

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,900
being open source it's not itself a

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,210
differentiator and I'd like to explain

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,640
why and perhaps offer some reasons for

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,410
hope I'm also looking forward to getting

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,939
a better understanding of what effect

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,179
this corporates who has in the open

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,620
source developers craft and by Colin and

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,610
by the vendors themselves like I am and

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,410
we should have time for Q&A at the end

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,059
so open source products spread

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,010
throughout the enterprise in current

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,590
Swiss as I expect as the casing most

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,899
enterprises we've already had some stats

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,780
that show how very likely this is going

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,370
to be and then then of course I was

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,789
commercial software so it's in-house

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,230
code and in fact it doesn't actually

00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,850
really matter what the source is

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,120
it's what we're actually trying to do

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,510
what best situations to the problem at

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,060
hand and that definition of suitability

00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:14,369
is primarily found on familiarity risk

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,869
and cost so if we start with cost open

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,580
source products are often brought into

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,340
an organization because they lob cost

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,920
less the similar functionality let's

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,900
travel back in time a little bit the

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,759
move from the mainframe towards unique

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,130
systems Watson primarily around

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,350
licensing it was because it's possible

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,500
to buy small units to scale based on

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,689
need it was possible with open systems

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,900
to have an interface was less dependent

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,460
on the hardware vendor I suspect he may

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,229
have heard similar comments in more

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,409
recent years around open source itself

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,210
and Graham cloud and then from there the

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,460
move from things like Solaris towards

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,229
Linux and a similar motivation at the

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,350
enterprise space

00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,729
running computer systems at a lower cost

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,829
now that moved to violence within the

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,680
enterprise really only started to scale

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,619
when they became vendors out there who

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,210
banked the trust and who could deal with

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,100
companies like Red Hat might be founded

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,780
Markin source and open source philosophy

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,580
but the reason they do a lot of business

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,710
the reason they came into banks was

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,560
because they could speak the corporate

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:20,530
language maybe they had to learn it

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,450
indeed within likely to Intel at credit

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,100
Swiss and other organizations spent

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,050
significant time and effort working on

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,110
systems with an odd collection of

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,820
commercial and the open-source

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,800
proprietary hardware and software before

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,480
actually working out what was the best

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,540
thing to do and to reduce the amount of

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,250
complication in our environment one of

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,230
the things we've done about making that

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,080
easy for ourselves is to make it more of

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,150
a defender problem for example when we

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,280
started playing Purdue we looked at the

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,130
open source product we fairly quickly

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,620
moved on to looking at distributions and

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,170
then we look at the vendors providing

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,030
the distributions and indeed one of the

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,040
vendors we were shortlisted essentially

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,470
was dismissed from the process because

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,360
they just could not talk the corporate

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,400
or we could not actually have

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,230
conversation that made sense to both of

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,830
us but had nothing to do with the

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,540
distribution itself so moving on to risk

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,620
there are two aspects I'd like to talk

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,120
about the first one is licensing open

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,190
source licensing is something that we

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,780
used to worry about a lot we don't so

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,510
much we've already talked a little about

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,370
legal and lawyers and so forth but and

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,320
in the early days you know there was

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,240
there was a great deal of father fear

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,300
uncertainty and doubt and it was about

00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,490
the viral nature of open source and the

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,470
fear the corporation's felt that if they

00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,480
started using these products then

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,670
private prisons business functionality

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,310
would be exposed to the eyes of the

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,620
world now there are some licenses that

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,230
still do worries a bit things like the

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,220
Avro license for example but in most

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,210
cases that the see threat has retreated

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,340
partly this is because there are better

00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,400
more commonly shared definitions of what

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,740
open source means we understand the most

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,570
common licenses throughout there partly

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,130
it's because as an organization we built

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,890
up that legal expertise to actually

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,040
understand those licenses to know how to

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,500
deal with them to have a cookbook

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,480
says if it's a GPL we can do this with

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,729
it it's an apache license we can do that

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,130
with it and partly it's because our

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,079
third-party relationships actually give

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,020
our corporate warriors a bit more

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,850
confident now the other element of risk

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,030
is the impact of issues in the software

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,830
itself they come a point in the process

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,280
where some of this stuff becomes

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,169
critical to the business do we really

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,350
want to bet the bank on software which

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:42,419
has no support contract can we as a

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,949
large-scale commercial corporation put

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,479
ourselves in a position where we don't

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,940
have a vendor on the other end of the

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,759
line both the phone line support life

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,090
are not phones anymore and the contract

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,099
line now perhaps it's a futile view if

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,139
you compare for example the timelines of

00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,449
matching koala crying and hardly as

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,940
profile examples the fact that one thing

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,410
from a corporate organization the other

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,300
one came from an open-source product

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,490
didn't make much difference but in the

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,539
end in fact that was definitely taken

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,370
you know that you could consider much

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,740
better outcomes for the open source

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,780
product in that case and perhaps

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,150
sometimes a contract is something of a

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,760
comfort blanket I see how much pressure

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,060
we need to bear for a big organization

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,159
to fix the patch that matters to us but

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,380
not to them or to actually get an

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,570
enhancement request to actually to go

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,630
from an idea that we have to something

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,090
which isn't their product now with the

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,190
products open-source yes potentially we

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,560
can just fix it ourselves we can't just

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,060
add that patch there are people in our

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,010
environment you could use a managed and

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,810
open source product you can deal with

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,139
the documentation whether it's good bad

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,229
or indifferent who can apply and perhaps

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,870
even supply patches so it may seem

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,520
strange we choose not to do this when

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,860
there is the bread and butter of the

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,630
development organization inside the bank

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:06,389
for our own in-house applications now

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,390
the difference here is that we see some

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,610
code as part of our business

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,760
Electrical property and increasingly

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,260
other software isn't considered business

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,910
differentiating and reticular and it's

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,770
interesting with the presentation we've

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,990
already had we've said that non-business

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,780
differentiating software is a good

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,700
reason to make an open-source now for us

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,980
it's a good reason to make it somebody

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,390
else's problem that doesn't necessarily

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,370
matter whether it's closed or open

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,160
source whether way using veritas cluster

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,790
server or pacemaker to do our clustering

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,560
and we as an organization don't think we

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,980
need to employ people for the expertise

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,640
that they will really mean so in the end

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,370
but when the answer to the support

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,220
question is slack Stack Overflow and a

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,970
mailing list then nervousness is going

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,800
to result from our corporate worries I

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,540
suspect that you will agree that it's

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,160
not a valid strategy to hope above what

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:08,120
the organization wants to know what the

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,190
medication risk is and that tends to

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,580
mean providing commercial intermediary

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,750
working with the commercial intermediate

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,690
doesn't really matter that likes in

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,720
itself is open source that Purdue is

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:23,180
Apache Hadoop when someone from the

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,790
Morea DB sales team comes to me and says

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,730
their product a spoken-- sauce what are

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,440
they actually trying to tell me name

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,020
perhaps it's the code that the code copy

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,090
made proprietary but even my sequels

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,380
ownership by Oracle hasn't removing the

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,100
GPL in that product

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,840
now to be fair but Maria DB and Postgres

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,850
have structures defined to make sure

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,680
that no single company can have you over

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,140
auto-ship the software as its

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,440
but again what difference does that make

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,640
to me I've seen the argument that I can

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,770
go to somewhere else to get my

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,380
commercial support for an open-source

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,450
product the when one support

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,000
organization already has a majority of

00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,360
the capability why would I go to a

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,640
junior plan there is a further concern

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,430
that a small banner couldn't bear the

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,800
weight of a large corporate and compare

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,490
that with an open-source product when

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,289
- no commercially to meet here at all

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,509
indeed taking significant amounts of

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,190
software from such sources might even be

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,710
seen as poor risk management by

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:30,199
regulated now thirdly familiarity across

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,099
the enterprise people are playing the

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,979
new toys whether its communities

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:38,510
Kassandra saltstack Pro we do see things

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,849
going into the enterprise from diverse

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,229
sources and we are building mechanisms

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,300
to allow developers to experiment

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,130
without immediately opening up the

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,950
organization to the risk of direct

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,019
downloads from the internet as a result

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,880
credits with staff and now playing the

00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,940
software before we take a strategic

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,350
decision of course most major vendors I

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,329
can think of will give you a trial

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,860
license for a product so there's always

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:04,250
a certain amount of friction with that

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,930
and before that stage it's a lot easier

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,880
to put a free and open source software

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,630
into the hands of those outside the

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,370
corporates

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,950
those who don't engage with the major

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,990
enterprise but solid food will move into

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,730
a business like out so to conclude I

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,220
mentioned familiarity risk and cost at

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,190
the start I focused more on risk of cost

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,770
as these are the more obvious priorities

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,959
for business cost generally benefits

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,089
open source while risk generally

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,089
generally means we want a commercial

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:36,620
vendor and building familiarity is

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,709
actually one of the best ways to reduce

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,570
the secret so perhaps in the enterprise

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:44,180
the advantages that open-source has

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,250
other kinds of software is in building

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,300
is in building that familiarity at low

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,610
cost use immense scale until external

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,980
support is considered necessary and by

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,720
that time hopefully developers and users

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,540
will have fallen in love with the

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,540
product I look forward to discuss

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:16,440
so I'm Cullen and I I alert the parts of

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:21,209
doing something fast from dick heart out

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,399
really and the god many years ago he

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,639
works in a single identity 2.0 and he

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:31,079
gave the keynote 1530 keynote with about

00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:35,910
120 slides so I think - I'm going to try

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:37,620
to do vaguely that so the premise is

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,440
that I come from a developer standpoint

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,779
you talk about really ble and I actually

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,180
was not the colony people reading visa

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:48,660
before that I also looked at MySQL so if

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,910
you clean your databases in the by SQL

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,940
ecosystem there is someone you can throw

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,740
excellent at least

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,820
so there's generally a premise that you

00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,680
start with the popular open source

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,029
project and then you decide that'd be me

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,160
at some stage it's time to make money

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,930
and then you form a corporation or

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,880
that's actually good business right as

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,620
doctor was saying it actually probably

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,720
wants to make sure that you have a

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,279
corporation backing you but typically

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,610
that you end up raising venture capital

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,260
if you want to grow fast and then when

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,570
you hire a sales team and they always

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,760
typically state that you end up using an

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:25,560
enterprise spin-off of some sort to

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:28,279
debone the community edition but this is

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:33,390
not necessarily how things work because

00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:35,699
potentially any Forks and the greater is

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,019
an excellent example more than 16 years

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,600
ago

00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,250
they decided to split Vera Linux into

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,130
Fedora core and relay

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,899
Enterprise Linux I presume a lot of you

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,720
here are familiar with will Enterprise

00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,850
Linux and probably use it in production

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,060
and maybe your developers are quite

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,839
happy playing around with fedora and

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,670
building what's next

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,529
but generally speaking most people

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,399
in enterprises would end up using the

00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:05,410
paid reddit and apprise Linux

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,339
subscription high startup using Braille

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,910
administration 1996

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:15,250
Colgate release by a cheap bikes do not

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,110
give you remember this but that you will

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,670
be paid for the distribution of the CD

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,079
and it it cost maybe one dollar

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,519
obviously you can't develop Linux and

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,250
support it for Donna riddle actually

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,700
goes down fairly well to tell you that

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,709
Fedora benefits the community rallies

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,660
built by Britta itself

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:40,000
alongside the community provider price

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,649
ID the community collaborates that we

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,930
are engineering and it's a mutually

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,540
beneficial relationship with rapid

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,430
innovation fedora obviously ask you any

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,089
and they've released twenty nine

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,200
releases since the start of the project

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:54,850
I'm happy to say that I was actually

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
understand the project as well I was on

00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,240
the first vesko Brenna got many things

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,459
right for one they did not leave it

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,730
reddit Linux community and written Linux

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:10,630
Enterprise branding was distinct fedora

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,699
and realm this policy gave you less

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,470
confusion it also meant that the

00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:16,089
community was not seen as second-class

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,630
citizen because it has gone branding

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:21,490
logos events like fat corn not not feel

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,220
to the endowment Fedora users and

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,890
developers conference it also helps the

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,560
sales team as well it's not an exciting

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:35,290
this was a very smart strategy medicated

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:38,470
splitting example MySQL now very

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,860
successful company I'd say it's so it's

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,079
a lot of success with the OEM licensing

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,880
and do a licensing basically eventually

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,350
so that sucked so that you they're not

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,079
going to pay for license if you want to

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,360
compact MySQL connector of course this

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,430
business doesn't exist anymore largely

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,019
because I think sequel might actually

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,170
kill DeLorean business I think all of

00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:01,570
you here in this room have access to a

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:05,770
sequel by database in in your pocket or

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,779
handbag or purse luckily because sequel

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:11,079
might runs on pretty much every move of

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:14,170
cloud out there I remind back to maybe

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:19,060
even 2005 and MySQL used to run on grow

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:21,550
up so that there were reasons to do a

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,940
license and this was a basically a way

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,920
to figure out the way to make money and

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,089
then eventually it was decided that we

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,850
should probably make that enterprise

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,040
release but you actually got nothing in

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,620
the enterprise release except the string

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,670
that said MySQL Enterprise this is not a

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,529
good way to split a community or offer

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,870
subscription or get people to buy your

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:49,089
product because people look beyond just

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:51,579
the enterprise tag the community reacted

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,500
very negatively to this largely because

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,750
non method code was actually going into

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,029
the enterprise when he so if you were

00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,829
paying MySQL you're getting access to

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,199
non meta code and you're actually

00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:04,390
encountering bugs and regressions before

00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,620
the community got access to it this is

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:13,029
the reverse Fedora red-eyed model which

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:15,040
generally seemed kind of useless and

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,130
even better naturally what would happen

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,620
is a community that is so actively using

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,690
to product would end up just working or

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,740
releasing the binaries that they could

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,480
get as far as the enterprise

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,920
subscription because the GPL allowed

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:32,529
them to do that MySQL was in my opinion

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,209
say for an acquisition is back then we

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:38,569
had nothing besides an enterprise

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,309
developing an article purchase son they

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,689
could also integrate the backup product

00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:44,540
which they have already purchased before

00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:46,579
2005 because they've got the major sorry

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,249
engine and nowadays you obviously get

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:53,600
access to plugins authentication plugins

00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:56,240
on it's triples and so forth we went

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,860
wrong with MySQL in many ways but for

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,600
one verse we underestimated our

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,069
community of users and developers my

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,499
style became the most popular

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:06,079
open-source database because of our

00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:07,579
users and developments and we obviously

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,209
underestimated the fact that the

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:14,269
community QA was very very good

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,730
many many eyes big bugs shallow right

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:20,149
then it turns out that many people use

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,339
it and all the problems they report it

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,759
or they fix it in fact this is probably

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:28,369
the reason why mysql today runs on my

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,410
feet of the top 20 websites and the

00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:32,389
Alexa ranking because throughout the

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,790
valley there is a shared understanding

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:37,749
and knowledge of how to hack my SQL will

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,920
having to pay a vendor why $90 to 80

00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:44,629
being is one of them and I don't think

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,819
they use my skill don't necessarily

00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,139
listen to your sales teams because you

00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,610
know you want to make sure that the

00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,720
community version is not actually the

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,029
untrusted version

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,679
we didn't make individual branding this

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,069
was clearly of this thing and you

00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,569
obviously if you're gonna sell something

00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:02,299
provide value otherwise the buyer is not

00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:05,959
going to find the value in pain except

00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:09,980
for insurance purposes don't know if you

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,380
remember eucalyptus yep so eucalyptus

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,149
was an open source compatible API to

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,750
Amazon Web Services

00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:20,000
and they decided to go open car and you

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,100
get fully functional services or from

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,129
the eucalyptus cloud but you likely have

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,470
to pay additional enterprise

00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:28,480
turns out moment they announce the open

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,799
court model NASA with just a major

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,059
yourself you could have just said

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,679
they're going too far

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:38,789
well they're going to create a new

00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:40,840
project on OpenStack a few years later

00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:43,149
you could have just went back to the

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,519
full open source movement and at the

00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:48,399
assaultive HP Network when the financial

00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,539
terms were not disclosed guess you can

00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,580
all know what that means

00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:54,220
Rubenstein is still very much alive and

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,220
kicking they are not there and some is

00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:08,409
just this week and nobody talks about

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:10,149
you can look listening not even HP sure

00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:13,059
we are we are Mara in the audience they

00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:15,399
Jessi depend upon easy to understand and

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,690
an offset like this week over the last

00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,850
week but they'll be a lot of people in

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:22,389
Parliament today on has a huge gathering

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,009
of OpenStack gathering in Berlin true

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:46,869
the kubernetes speed up cell probably

00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:51,940
even larger now but yes so max 20

00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:53,649
minutes we are not so Mac scale there

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,809
plenty of pockets for proxies in

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:58,149
everyone says we need to load balance or

00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:01,269
MySQL servers so there are three proxies

00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:03,039
and our will provide the one the

00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:05,529
community provides another and really

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,279
provide one as well and supervised in

00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:10,929
fact just change licenses the Chinese

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,100
licenses to pick up time delayed open

00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:13,629
source and it was all the first time

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,639
this happened go script the landing

00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:17,230
license back in the mid-90s had this as

00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:19,480
well and became cheap here after year

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,399
and install with himself said I consider

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,379
Li the problematical compromised at

00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:28,299
least gave us free software after a year

00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:30,429
this was 20 years ago basically the BSL

00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,120
actually tells you that you are here an

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,490
additional news grant which basically

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,340
that if you need to use it for any use

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:42,580
case we have three servers you'd end up

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:45,920
paying a license fee quick aside is that

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,010
this is a get up checking of what it

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,480
looks like to have an open source

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,450
product where people check in code

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,580
things around 8:00 to 5:00 or 6:00 p.m.

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,010
and this is what looks like an open

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,800
source project where people check in

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,700
pretty much all the time except maybe on

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,800
a weekend there were no Forks of mac

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,140
scale largely because there were

00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,420
alternatives for you to use so if you

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,270
today wants to use a proxy that's open

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,380
source because foxy SQL but that doesn't

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,360
mean that people actually in the

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,970
enterprise care about the use of HIV

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,490
forever will I be getting support and

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,650
what additional functionality can I get

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,050
and it turns out Mexico is doing quite

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,120
well I don't know what could have been

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,890
done better is early morning versus

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,530
shock-and-awe Shaka noise something

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,990
you'd ever want to have cloud needs

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,240
open-source pretty much every project

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,420
you get today is available in the plot

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,490
being Amazon's Cloud Microsoft's cloud

00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,740
alibaba's plan and so forth in fact RDSP

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:49,370
SQL makes more money than all of my SQL

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,710
providers for mine British laughs

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,810
basically employs the creator of British

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,210
they've raised a lot of money and

00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,580
they're BSD license but they have access

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,970
to the trademark and they decided to

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,550
actually basically add a comment clause

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,340
to the Apache 2 license which is pretty

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:10,580
clearly not Apache 2 license and lots

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,740
people complained about this and they

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,050
said a GPL did not work at the affero

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,200
GPL development because cloud providers

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,160
from offering managed services for them

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,320
Google actually has a policy that

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,450
clearly states you can never use a GPL

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,270
software even on your employee provided

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,740
laptop for example so I'm not so sure

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,120
DGP LS is being accepted as much

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,550
registers of doing poorly I'll keep that

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,909
in mind if as soon as they renamed the

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,519
account

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:42,349
they actually had love having that huge

00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,999
amount of yo-yos a quantum particle that

00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:47,059
would double digits for the tenth

00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:49,700
consecutive quarter it was driven by the

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:52,759
PCs they've already raised series D

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,220
they'd capital venture cents Amazon and

00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:58,789
others cannot continue confusing open

00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:02,720
source the community reacted 1/4 all the

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:07,099
modules so you can still access it by a

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,169
community supported version long baby is

00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,029
that an extremely successful business

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,619
one well as well they took the company

00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,879
public value recently and I think

00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:15,830
they're very successful open source

00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:17,720
company because they built all these SAS

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,460
solutions around it did not when we

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,349
focus on the thought database product

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,729
but they've also decided and not

00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,529
something on the server side public

00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:26,840
license because they decided the a GPL

00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,599
was not sufficient to provide to protect

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,279
our providers this is probably perfect

00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,139
for all of you as well because you

00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,529
probably are going to run mamanucas

00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:38,779
service and provided internally to your

00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:42,019
customers and something entirely clear

00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:44,690
what happens that my suits are tiny fear

00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,129
is because this is happening as we speak

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,989
it only happened about a month ago and

00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:49,820
they still waiting for to see this

00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:51,289
course I approval so they actually just

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,379
said there's a license discussed

00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:56,659
meaningless there's a long thread of

00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:58,759
discussions about why the SSP

00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:02,749
PL should not be accepted as a choice a

00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:04,549
license many corporations tell you to

00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:06,499
sign a particular license agreement and

00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,299
many corporations that want a flat

00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:09,979
computer themselves like yours may not

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,039
want to because the minors are not very

00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:14,929
interested in a CLA and this actually

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,729
allows commercial running the product to

00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,559
market versions the product under noble

00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,320
salt and non free license at this may

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,519
not necessarily work and many but

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,259
generally speaking there are many do

00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:30,710
realized products out there from

00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:32,509
eucalyptus MySQL and so forth so maybe

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,299
there is no canonical open source

00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:37,190
business model mobile sources at it now

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:40,700
I think that's really very fun to take

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,190
away you still make money with open

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,989
source obviously you can sell advice

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,759
trip ships I mean that's exactly what

00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:48,980
most people are not doing we're very

00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,379
successful subscription service business

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,929
you can do a licensed professional

00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:56,389
services SAS the greatness as long as

00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:58,730
willing to sell proprietary plugins time

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:00,950
today open sauce may work it worked

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,350
previously may still work today or

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,879
advertising partnerships but you don't

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,409
want to miss your community of people

00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:08,210
that are actually using yourself where

00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:10,220
the developers because everyone here

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,929
today is going to probably play around

00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,429
with self gonna give an input mint

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,639
software with what your developers have

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:19,460
chosen is don't give up shopping or

00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:22,249
respect the community provider obviously

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,739
real depreciation and obviously provide

00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:26,450
the community to give you feedback

00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:28,009
before you actually make changes so you

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:32,389
know with that like to pass it on to

00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:35,259
Diane to give you the view from the the

00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,259
actual price

00:24:43,350 --> 00:25:04,930
keep my supply of water handy so I

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,090
really like the title of the program

00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:12,970
today for this slop because it is

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:16,000
complicated and great job enjoying it

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:18,880
I'm Diane Mueller I'm the director of

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,510
community development for the vu but

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,160
really what I focus on is open shift

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,720
open source community development and

00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,780
all of the stuff and all of the

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,430
relationships around that so I'm here to

00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,740
tell you that it is really complicated

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,510
I'm not going to focus so much on the

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,460
licensing side of things though one of

00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,530
my very first jobs is looking for

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,230
different active State

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,840
going through all the Python libraries

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,630
for our distribution was sold as an

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,130
enterprise offering so I've got some

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,600
understanding of licensing issues and

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,600
the great love of the legal department

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:08,350
so I'm not gonna belabor the point about

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:11,869
open shift and open source in Red Hat

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:14,629
but we have then made a very successful

00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:19,669
company based on an open source piece

00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:21,850
ethos and one of the many projects and

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:24,080
products that we work with is really

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,669
getting that most of you in the finance

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,580
sector have under the hood

00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,860
somewhere at your enterprises and so

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,320
we've been really trying to help you

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,139
bring that open source of innovation to

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,999
the enterprise and that's not an easy

00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:39,879
thing to do we work with all of your

00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:42,109
legal departments all of your different

00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:44,149
different officers in identical

00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:47,989
compliance and helping you bring those

00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:50,779
fingers to the enterprise our ethos is

00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:52,730
really around all not just open source

00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:54,549
and open sourcing the code but also

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,809
having so many communities and

00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:00,499
collaborating with multiple communities

00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:04,460
so we will have that yes the code is out

00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:06,769
in public but github repo or in some

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:10,039
source code repository need to be all

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:12,259
the share things but it is also about

00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,470
having that openness in the governance

00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:16,179
and openness to collaborate with other

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,580
communities

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:20,649
sometimes competing communities that's

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,659
really doing it and we always ever have

00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:25,929
I love this diagram because it really

00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:30,039
talks about how much you know in the DNA

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:33,249
of RedHat open source is it also points

00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:37,480
out the number of projects that Red Hat

00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:41,289
has its finger in and we talk mostly we

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,110
focus on cloud offerings and rel and

00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,929
Linux and but there are millions of

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:49,809
projects and I kid you not that Red Hat

00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:51,669
has someone contributing to somewhere in

00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:55,350
Red Hat over the history of red path so

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:58,960
it's really not just about Linux here

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:04,090
and consuming open-source is is not

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,240
trivial and what you're really really to

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:10,059
try and bring it to the enterprise to

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,159
make it so that you have the services

00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:15,269
and the support I need in order to

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,799
deliver that to your customers but also

00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:20,519
that we are representing ourselves in

00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:24,159
lots of different places you know us

00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,840
I've always been a intermedia operating

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,560
system here soon

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,180
and also but really it's about working

00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,090
with all the different parties whether

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,710
it's the Linux Foundation or open

00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,930
banking or one of the many other

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,980
projects that it's a foundational level

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:44,400
or at the underpinnings in the

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,400
individual project

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:54,989
but there's a lot of things that go on

00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:56,850
and a lot of complications there's a lot

00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:59,730
of upstream dynamics that we have to

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,980
come out work with and one of the

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,899
reasons is is that code is a living

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,789
breathing thing though I might not be

00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:09,480
able to breathe I have this cold air and

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:12,299
I made up a lot today but there are lots

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,429
of changes being made and lots of code

00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:16,350
updates and pushed and overdressed and

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,389
lots of contribution being made and

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,279
keeping track of them and somebody

00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,809
mentioned earlier kubernetes is one of

00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,720
the most active projects that i've ever

00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:28,049
worked on and it's under the hood of the

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,730
open ship project as well but there are

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:32,279
at a moment I think this is probably a

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,350
little out of date 877 I think this is

00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,980
about two or three months old and it's

00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:41,429
probably almost calm have together with

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:45,090
a number of the tributes to it so but

00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:47,519
the real key here is for red hat is we

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:50,519
put a lot of resources on these projects

00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,529
that are working on them almost 50% of

00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,629
leave open shipped programmers and

00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:57,480
coders that are working on open shipped

00:29:54,629 --> 00:30:00,989
inside of Red Hat are making direct

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,779
contributions to kubernetes so we have a

00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:05,779
real tight relationship with that but we

00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:08,340
also are doing a lot of bug fixes and

00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:11,369
making sure that things work really

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,220
nicely not just for people who are using

00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:16,169
an open ship which is red hats

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,720
kubernetes distribution but also for

00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:23,730
everybody else so it's an interesting

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:27,659
balance that we have and in maintaining

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,039
that and also driving a business that we

00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,779
mention

00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:35,419
that was the first time largest

00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:38,539
contributor but Red Hat has a ton of

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:43,100
people working on UNIX itself we have

00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:45,080
done now eleven releases of open ship

00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,090
which is a kinetics of distribution so

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,789
if every time kubernetes puts out

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:53,600
another release which is a three on

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:55,879
cycle now we have to vet it run it

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,580
through our test processes and make sure

00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:02,869
that it hits recertified as a pure be a

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:05,629
certified offering and and all that

00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:09,289
takes a lot of coordination so there's

00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:12,409
tons of people that are working at the

00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,729
city level so a special interest area

00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:16,700
for a working group within the

00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:17,690
kubernetes community a lot of them are

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,599
working from grete

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,700
but there's not just the leads and

00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,649
there's over 40 groups inside of

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,619
communities that are working on

00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:30,109
different aspects of kubernetes the red

00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,609
ones are ones in which we have one of

00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:33,559
the co-chairs is there but we have

00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:35,840
resources on every single one of these

00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:39,080
projects at the moment so it's it's

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,299
pretty extensive the amount of effort

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,169
and resources that RIT have what's in

00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:49,279
tune on this project so we though people

00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:51,889
who know us mostly for realm and Linux

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,809
we didn't really stop at Linux and Linux

00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:58,220
is really the underpinning of almost

00:31:53,809 --> 00:32:00,049
every cloud but it's also then a number

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,359
of other projects that have come out of

00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:05,239
it that we've spun into making products

00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:08,869
so we didn't really stop there and we

00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:10,369
just kept going because in art from our

00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:13,129
perspective clinics is what makes all of

00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:15,769
this possible from that we created an

00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:17,239
offering that was Enterprise Linux we

00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,519
went into kvms

00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:22,519
from that we started moving into the

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,289
cloud and now we're into projecting into

00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,220
the open hybrid clouds which will enable

00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:31,159
you to run multiple workloads on

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:35,389
in-house on prime clouds or on anybody

00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:38,779
else's AWS and or any other cloud as

00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:40,399
well now we come back to containers and

00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:43,599
there's a whole lot of work being done

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,099
there around another foundation project

00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:49,970
offering cocoa CIA open container

00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:52,279
initiative and then we get to kubernetes

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:55,090
which i think is the poster child right

00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:57,950
now for for every software development

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:00,549
offering right now and it is also the

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:04,309
underpinning of Katie and that's really

00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:07,489
ok and I always say reading just

00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,529
recently renamed our open source project

00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:12,529
to Coke ad and I think everybody did it

00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,659
was ok Diane if I aren't being so much

00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:17,539
but she was also I mind

00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:20,179
katie-ann but really what happened was

00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:23,349
about five years ago we had platform as

00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:28,070
a service offering which was worshipped

00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:30,529
it's called the rich in origin and when

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:33,799
kubernetes came out we really limited

00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:35,690
very quickly and built out our whole

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,119
infrastructure on top of your name so

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:42,169
from community managers point of view

00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:45,879
which is what the nature of my job is is

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:49,609
we really had to get involved with that

00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:52,279
project and so everything that mattered

00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:55,190
we are now on communities distribution

00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,080
and we're certified that changed the

00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,109
nature of our project so instead of

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,269
being a single offering that was pretty

00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:03,470
much very red hat focus most of the

00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:08,329
resources working on the original

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:10,549
project were open chef developers that

00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,799
changed the whole nature of how we

00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:15,049
related to other communities and how we

00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:17,599
collaborated with other communities so

00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:19,490
it got complicated but in some ways it

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,789
got easier because we had more people

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:25,309
collaborating with us more voices

00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:29,809
looking at the codebase and expanded our

00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:31,970
community much bigger so if you think

00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:34,010
about what they're doing besides having

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,599
the kubernetes folks involved in this so

00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,679
coop entities is a big chunk of what it

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,029
is but there's a whole lot of other

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:43,309
things that run on in an under open ship

00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:45,619
so we also touch on all of these other

00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:48,169
communities and we do that we have over

00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,639
100 integrations that we have to deal

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:53,119
with and as the community manager

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,129
relationships manage the release cycles

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,680
and know when those are all aligned in

00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:00,329
time so that we know when things are

00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,000
getting pushed up and then these get

00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:05,670
pushed out into our actual product

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,220
offerings the interesting thing is we do

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,930
we do what we call open source first so

00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,930
everything gets pushed into open said

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,450
into the open source of repo but it gets

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:18,690
tested almost immediately on o be

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:21,630
shipped online so we have posted

00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,180
offering check online and one which

00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,430
should dedicate which is a management

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,720
and insert right but we have tens of

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,210
thousands of developers who are

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,339
instantly any pinging our new code

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,289
releases each time so we have all of

00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:40,049
those relationships that we have to

00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:41,760
manage besides that I have a full

00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:43,920
universe of people who are now

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,019
developing them and deploying

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,380
applications with inside of enterprises

00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:52,500
so the complications of managing all of

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,990
these relationships has been pretty

00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:58,829
significant so it's not just red hat

00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:02,369
building code in a vacuum everything has

00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:05,519
changed and this is out of date even now

00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:10,529
we have over 450 members in an

00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:12,420
organization what we've had to do in

00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:14,579
order to make this work is create sort

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,779
of a new cross community collaboration

00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,630
model so if you think of what a

00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:18,730
traditional

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,930
any manager is moving from isequal or

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,580
one of the other projects we've

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,140
mentioned they're all about trying to

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,290
get good contribution to their

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,880
individual project in our case we're

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:30,310
trying to make sure that the

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,440
communication lines between all of these

00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:35,320
different communities and all of the

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,540
different projects that feed into OKC

00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,570
and OpenShift and the product offerings

00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:44,230
are all aligned and communicating well

00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:46,240
so we really try to do cream you've got

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,360
to think about what the fire hose is now

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,930
of information that's coming through

00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:56,320
this project and the projects that are

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:58,080
next to it and so we've got tons of I

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,240
think I've done over a hundred and fifty

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,780
briefings this past year they're all on

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,750
YouTube we have weekly community

00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,670
meetings or not just for openers but

00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:13,690
we're also involved in the communities

00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:17,410
one was a lot of the other home ciencia

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:19,240
projects as well and a very very active

00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,830
slack channel and I know what you

00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,690
financed not a lot of you get to use

00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,460
slack because it's behind a firewall and

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,170
all of that but we'll talk about that in

00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,100
another session a little bit later this

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:31,120
afternoon called overcoming barriers to

00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,530
collaboration

00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,500
so that's we'll talk a little bit about

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,540
how to get access to all of that but the

00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,970
very interesting thing about this is

00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,310
when we we did this whole pivot to a new

00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:45,910
open community model and doing all this

00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,080
clustering that the contribution the

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,350
thing that

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:54,690
Python the most or get bonus don't most

00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:57,940
was exponential so by changing the model

00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:01,870
from very much focused on contribute to

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:04,150
my thing we actually changed the whole

00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,730
ethos of that because we had so many

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:09,970
more eyeballs on our project we have

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:12,880
over 70 companies external to read back

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:15,940
now contributing to the OpenShift court

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,060
cookies so actually getting that set

00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,370
method by people who we probably weren't

00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:24,240
collaborating this closely with when we

00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,800
were single project that was just posted

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,370
originally it with Ruby on Rails on a

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,890
MongoDB project and so we really shifted

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,710
when we've joined and brought two

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,900
grantees into into the conversation

00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:42,070
around what OpenShift is everything

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:44,320
changed so we have tried to really help

00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:47,110
the conversations though by being very

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,110
virtual but I'm I am here in person so I

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,490
do fly we have one of the most active

00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:55,330
slack channels that I've ever

00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:56,650
participated in and that's really sort

00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,289
of an amazing thing

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,940
to go in there and have people from all

00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:03,069
walks of life all of the different

00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,200
companies that are computing and using

00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:08,319
for this are really moving very very

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,140
fast to help and support other people

00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:13,990
and answer questions so what their real

00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,720
future for open-source really looks like

00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:18,819
is about collaboration and collaboration

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,510
in the upstream the things that feed our

00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:24,069
products and create this it's it's also

00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:28,059
I wanted to really point out Fitness

00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:30,010
across multiple streams so any of you

00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,390
have participated in the cloud native

00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,160
foundation we know that they're

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,500
continuing at this chart there's no way

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,020
to keep this slide up to date because

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,920
they're always adding new projects that

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:44,529
are part of this ecosystem we're doing a

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,510
lot with a lot of other projects because

00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:48,520
all of these things were originator and

00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,940
open tracing they're helping us do the

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,029
monitoring or open ship deployments

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:58,029
these are the real things that this

00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:59,500
really it's not just about the code and

00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:02,109
I think I can't emphasize that enough

00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,079
that it's really about the people who

00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:06,609
are using the project and then getting

00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,980
involved so the companies like

00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:12,010
yourselves that are using openshift I

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:15,010
can't tell you how much of the value

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:17,310
gets added to our product offerings by

00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,890
people external to Red Hat where you

00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:23,610
and bringing that wealth of information

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:26,010
and feedback into the operating so which

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,210
if comments join us we can get you on

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,710
that slide channel if you have

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,430
Commission otherwise we'll figure out

00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,910
something else

00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:35,700
lots of things happening be back here in

00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,580
London on January 30th doing up an

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,170
ownership Commons gathering I know

00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,270
that's my limit I've got a little hand

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,640
sign going there so I'm gonna stop and

00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:47,550
let you guys ask questions of the three

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,320
of us and really thank you for listening

00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:51,530
to us and I'm so pleased that I didn't

00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,670
talk too much

00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:57,119
[Applause]

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,119
