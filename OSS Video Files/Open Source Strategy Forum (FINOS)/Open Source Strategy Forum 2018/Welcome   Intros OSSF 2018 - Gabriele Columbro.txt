00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:20,400
so we got pending the flavor asking me

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,230
and catch up on difficulties but I'm

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,960
gonna start by you know thanking all of

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,410
you for being here so thank you our

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,449
sponsors for making this possible this

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,430
is the first time you can do strategy

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,040
firm in London so I'm really excited

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:40,739
about leaving San Francisco you might

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,890
hear it slightly impacts I'm sorry thank

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:49,010
you so much for not be useful so again I

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,180
just thank you know thank our sponsors

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,360
like there's make sure that you come

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,770
around and also admitting partners in

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,680
case you're not familiar with in us

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,079
which I hope by now you would you might

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,110
remember us from types of simply

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,490
Software Foundation we started 2015

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,740
focused on building the community round

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,930
symphony do you know who's joining most

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,390
of you know in the software and 30 of

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,890
this year we got bored it's you know I'm

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,820
pretty lucky to be the executive

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,670
director of you know pretty influential

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,159
board with a lot of Technology and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,939
financial institutions we don't I

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,250
thought there was a much broader

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,020
opportunity and the conflicts in the

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,299
industry was changing and we could go

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,970
after you know any big brother koukin

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,229
source standards opening a collaboration

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,950
across a mystic and so only the year in

00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:47,210
April we actually lost a new man in us

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:53,240
wait okay so the one thing it spin-offs

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,240
I've heard pronouncing it not really

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,290
some Pinot has not financed

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
instance thanks for paying that go

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,869
Cancer Foundation we're talking over a

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,129
rating system

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:10,810
yes so hope three main questions

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,569
get out of the next three days and we

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,319
hope that he will take the vest you know

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,370
so keeping away from these three days

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,310
you know it's always a question about

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,709
why I'm hoping to make attempts today

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,180
why you should consider contributing to

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,459
open source where they get a financial

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,870
institution where your knowledge member

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,739
whether you're both whatever you

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:38,200
consider yourself I'm trying to make it

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:40,180
that today you know if you have seen for

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,620
the last year in New York that was

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,160
leading the big focus for this year

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,110
shining the light thing is just why it

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,519
makes sense for this industry to

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,720
collaborate in you this edition of the

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,530
society problems going to be very

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,799
focused on how we think that even just

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,700
in the last six months there's been a

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:05,319
major understanding of how when to

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,849
collaborate opening this industry is

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,030
it's really important that you get your

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:12,579
processes of a technology legal really

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,319
cultural segment together to make sure

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:19,420
that you know and finally what do we

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,819
have seen us have to do with it I'm

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,709
gonna try to make them number one

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:28,269
another three in the next 12 minutes

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,150
make sure they attend as many sessions

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:35,019
as possible and don't forget to provide

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,609
work with all the TVs here some mustn't

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,859
live in San Francisco some of us in Kivu

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,690
are some got Salona so this is a unique

00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,819
opportunity to be a whole team and

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,739
sometimes all community would have a lot

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,799
of programs with an XT days and

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,329
contributors you know joining in in

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,489
birth certificates is a very powerful

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:59,349
way now how do you come and get you how

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:03,549
did we get here you know yeah the spiel

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:05,470
of and passion about open source I do

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,450
have been open source and certainly

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,450
there is some truth in it I you know

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,269
always work in open source sample is by

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:17,700
the communities that serpent he was

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,420
serve our College was from me today's

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,280
but this fool

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:26,770
not just about passion over to some of

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,070
the last five months you know show you

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,930
be following the news there being some

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:38,260
major milestones if you want the

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,820
recognition of the value of open source

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,150
in the commercial bank accordance of

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,880
cement is a huge number Sam you know you

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,070
got the Cloudera homeworks verbs are

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,640
that the friends from brand half and

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,810
give helping the room will you know a

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,300
building good time of their of their

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,390
life right now and I think that's you

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,640
know again passing to the fact that we

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,820
are way past them from old idea that

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,830
open source equals three and so you know

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,420
I single it is an element compassion I

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,570
think things in heaven opportunity for

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:13,060
everyone but this is certainly a

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,980
commercial you know everyone that

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,140
participates overdose immunity most of

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,230
its abilities are based on corporate

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:23,440
funding you know there will be no quick

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,300
advancement communities without a public

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,080
panic so wanna make sure that you know

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,430
it's it's clear that video is not just I

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,130
think it browser manage it they will

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,130
talk about that but very much specific

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,290
and so given these three maps are you

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,990
know something that's going to be the

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,690
talk of the town and the other talk of

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,460
the town is always giving pinches

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,890
investors how many masters in image

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,500
today what's your source of work what's

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,360
your enemy I figured that I did

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,900
something a little bit non-standard

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,010
which is doing a pitch that but not

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,540
pinching you know I'm not asking for

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:06,490
money this is it's that for contributing

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,230
twelve in general contribute to open

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,960
source and why would you want to do it

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,570
as an open source so there's a financial

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,530
services battle burn or you know

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:20,050
decision maker and so I hope the bend of

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,170
the sock Indian tends to be so into

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,220
participating yeah and in turn toward

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,710
open source community

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,200
you know one of the airplane we see

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,490
yourself as an enabler for famously but

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,060
by no means you should

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,910
okay - this is about enabling we're a

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,560
non-profit you know to enable the

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,070
industry for the benefit of their

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,470
holding this place and not just for us

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:49,530
so nothing about throwing the pitch that

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,880
passion so what's what's the problem

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,700
that we're trying to solve here well I

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,430
think I see three main problems there I

00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:01,410
think pretty connected in general

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,320
collaborating in regulated industries

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,810
it's hard I think you will come that

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,940
means collaborating in software as well

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,490
as collaborating you know in any other

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,650
fashion if you want it is you know

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,600
regulations which are you know necessary

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,610
make which makes it make it really

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,560
complicated and so I think that's what

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,290
we realize that the worse again an

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,840
opportunity to bring sort of kuben to be

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,620
successful methodologies of

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,720
collaboration that we've seen in other

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:33,270
industry in financial services a big

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,880
effect I think of the complexity of

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,710
collaboration here is that you know the

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,380
technology landscape in financial

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,400
services three different methods

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,370
no obviously we are believing a

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,990
revolution in this industry but again

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:51,000
there's very much I think organic growth

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,200
that is not necessarily consolidated

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,970
it's not really sort of showing a you

00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,530
know those traits of consolidation of

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,440
standardization that we've seen in other

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,160
industries and so I think that makes you

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,020
know it's um creates a vicious circle

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,360
you know you can collaborate your

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,980
technology is not you know as standard

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,110
as it could be and that's simply the

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,940
spiral that it's very easy fuel to come

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,350
out and we think of it so sandhya

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,910
solution to get past that finally this

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,720
is a broader problem that's why

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,570
conditions exist in many ways in many

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,420
cases called open source is not easy in

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:34,470
general and that's regardless of you

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,360
know financial service area you can

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,479
start a little movement so when you

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,490
throw mine when you throw corporate

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,270
interests in there

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,800
to balance that and so one way that

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,810
foundations help is by sort of decent

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,200
and behaving and creating this safe

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,750
space for both large small companies

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,520
individuals to participate and so these

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,060
are release of the three main problems

00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,520
that we see ourselves so Bank of time to

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:04,670
solver help something from the river and

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,290
so when we regret we know you're in here

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,029
we defined our vision as you know

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,520
driving over the open innovation in

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,779
financial services not going to spend

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,830
too much into this again I don't want

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:22,310
this to be a to expect about finance but

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:27,560
well a couple of points here one what is

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:30,620
open innovation well specifically about

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,420
what we mean but just a little we are

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,890
not just long as the open source we have

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,050
a lot of programs that are working on

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,000
open standards they're an open developer

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,399
platform will be self-starting offering

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,540
open api is an open data there's many

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,700
ways that open collaboration kappa not

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,980
very different source you know we will

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,649
be able to help you and sort of handhold

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,740
you for maternity open standard is a

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:57,200
good start open api is a second set but

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,490
then you know hopefully we'll be able to

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,430
be able to common platforms together i

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,959
think we have a massive collection here

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:12,290
aim to create a common infrastructure

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:16,250
that is terms of the opportunity for all

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,980
of you I think my passion program sauce

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:22,190
comes from the fact that there is you

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,380
know and if you beat your parents I like

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,860
to say the cleanup is the new link there

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,079
in the world where you know more and

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,010
more people code and the plan doesn't

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,260
seem to solve

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:37,640
I will not hire anyone without being

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,890
able to look at people program and so I

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,370
think it is pretty clear by now so how

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,270
can I stand up why individually you want

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,450
to participate open source community

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,290
I do think that there's also a

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,950
commitment I'll show you a couple of

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,260
examples

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,090
again there's plenty of literature there

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,660
you'll hear a lot about it over the next

00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:01,020
holidays but again I give a couple of

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,850
examples but I also love the fact that I

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,830
think there is a global benefit in open

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,410
collaboration if we stop bringing back

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,940
in the wheel if we stop you know start

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,470
building on each other

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,510
achievements again you're talking about

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,370
non-competitive technology here nobody's

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,670
talking about forking out to save

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,650
yourselves there is no expectation from

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,350
that but if we stop inventing the wheel

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,740
we must be doing something good for the

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,500
world

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,270
I mean what the mind though you know I

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,780
feel like I thought that sort of pallet

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:35,460
depth rather than building a lot of

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:37,230
similar shallow sort of talent pools we

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,110
could build on top of each other and

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:43,170
really create a deeper talent which

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,540
means faster innovation so well I think

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,670
that is implode individual benefit but

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,940
if you want to have a bit more you know

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:54,210
variables an idea of what the corporate

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,560
benefits might be if you are in

00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,810
technology back then you might want to

00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,970
look at that this comes from a new

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,760
father was just created so open source

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,980
OSS the catechol actually this

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,780
spreadsheet is actually open source

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,220
itself you can go get it he pulls

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,140
together all the commercial open source

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,710
companies out there this over the last

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,840
13 years the major ones showing based on

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,060
how much they rave eight by five billion

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,210
defense of PC has been written outcome

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,950
of 70 billion of potential variation of

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,500
happening 40 bills again I'm frantically

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,900
numbers on the commercial opportunity of

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,120
corporate open source and obviously we

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,410
got the right up folks each other you

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,640
know folks you may want to go have a

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,010
chat with them and see what they think

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,850
about it but I mean this is just a

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:45,060
there's a true opportunity and you feel

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,340
what about you should not a vendor what

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,810
if you are you know it's a County

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,240
company wanna be their partner

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,269
now banks becoming technology companies

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,449
mean to me that is a very simple

00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,459
explanation as to why you know Silicon

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:03,160
Valley or the hook is able to you know

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:05,860
develop faster or you know competes up

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,829
to a next level there and it's just it's

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,199
a simple as in my mind they just develop

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,029
less if you look at you know a typical

00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,089
stack of an application and may be able

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:18,430
to build out west but the cloud

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,470
infrastructure is neutralized most of

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,490
the data stores middleware not my

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,050
framework so if you like the open source

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,699
probably how much is left right in to

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,129
provide rate rather than building the

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,749
whole set very little I was looking for

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:33,730
this number actually over the last few

00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:35,829
days and there was a good presentation

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,230
yesterday from the NPR phones you know

00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:42,189
we know them from you know JavaScript

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,639
depositing this had 97 percent from

00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:48,279
their standpoint of the UI abuses that

00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:52,149
you see built on JavaScript it's salable

00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:54,610
so some products on creeper just need an

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,379
idea maybe you know a little bit push a

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,290
little bit optimistic but I would have

00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:01,420
guessed unlikely but I'm gonna say right

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,790
and so again we can't necessarily you're

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,029
a commercial company selling software or

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,860
you are a bank wanted to innovate

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,079
that's really world it so she can bring

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,670
to you I'm not going to spend enough

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,939
time on this because you know we

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,279
discussed a lot how does this work

00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:20,740
you know we have open source projects

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:24,040
from which companies build products

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:26,230
which turn into profits and then a part

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,579
of it is reinvested in fueling the

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,550
growth of the ecosystem whether it's

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:33,069
time to sweat I believe contributions we

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,079
love to have us or money if you're not

00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:37,449
ready to contribute well you can become

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:41,189
a member still help us accelerate or we

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:43,679
do so this is how generally the whole

00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:46,420
business works

00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,379
it's only you know we haven't said what

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,839
do people use

00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,550
I mean finish necessary we will use

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,860
innovation that's what we think is a

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,759
non-profit even we're not you make money

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,540
we hope that what we can produce faster

00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:06,390
innovation

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:10,060
system how do we do that again I will

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,560
recommend you to come talk to us but you

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,690
know there are three main things that we

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,090
do I think fundamentally we provide

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,400
trust we disintermediate between all

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,720
these components and that's released and

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,510
the role of all open source on this

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,920
being a dependent trusted nonprofit

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,540
plays well you know large corporate and

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,210
potentially competitors can collaborate

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,160
together with individuals but we also

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,130
have an open developer platform that

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,350
allows you to be efficient if you have

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,060
anything to the foundation we want you

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,580
to be as efficient and as fast as

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,040
possible and do it in a compliant way so

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,140
you hear a lot about a buffer on a

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,400
stupid next two days and we love you to

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:53,650
help us of shape and finally we

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,260
spin-offs esteem we help you grow and

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,180
succeed so the programs that are in the

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,430
foundation and the members work at the

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,530
foundation we have a vested interest and

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,360
don't the project don't get option

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,340
growing the community making sure that

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,360
it's successful and understanding that I

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:13,780
wait so it's a bit of an eye chart I'm

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,480
running a long time but these are all

00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,790
our products this is the different

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,070
initiatives and I'm really excited to

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,630
have two more programs and we'll be

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,940
discussing about today

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,650
the problems are really just containers

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,990
for collaborative initiatives we have

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:32,350
open standard edition of per second

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:36,520
disagree we have codes like plexus

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,100
hadouken we have you know the open

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,820
developer platform which is meant by the

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,470
FBX program developer experience we have

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,020
enablement programs like different

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,750
source brightness provisioning today is

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,670
a big part of so I'm not gonna go

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,170
through this but please come and ask us

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,630
how you can contribute

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,790
anyone can participate a problem there's

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,980
no price trend no membership we have

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,410
obviously to an existing group on top of

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:07,510
you something new these all open source

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:10,600
ok so we love to you I don't ever well

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,850
not because truly the roadmap is you

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,010
we are a relatively small team and

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:17,440
certainly our members help us drag the

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,260
direction of the foundation it's about

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,600
contributions how fast we can move and

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,060
what are these first problems that will

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,010
sew together really depends on how many

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,010
contributions will get really depends on

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,460
how much you see value in so many

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,020
problems together so I have a few ideas

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,640
you hear a lot of them over the next

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,380
days the different sessions but hey this

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,480
is not going to happen and the pieces

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:48,520
happen depends on you

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,440
depends on what contributions and so you

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,600
know I will say you know we need you

00:17:50,440 --> 00:18:00,490
just handle I put my govern themselves

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:02,440
only 13 years throny we wanted to do the

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,690
conference here in London also to show

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,170
that while we roll most of our paper

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,140
wraps this is a global communication

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,600
here and there are some from financial

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,550
institutions and I do believe that we

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,350
grow up here especially northern Europe

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,600
and there is a massive Brussels

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,820
understanding open source and passionate

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,460
open source so I think this is about

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:28,210
time to you know make it happen all same

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,570
disease that sounds and you sold again

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,840
I'm not asking for money

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,840
thank you so much

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,960
