Description: 
	Speaker: Jilayne Lovejoy, SPDX / OpenChain Projects
Presentation: Training: Intro to Open Source

This training session will cover some of the topics from the OpenChain curriculum, including:

introduction to intellectual property law as related to open source
introduction to open source licenses
overview of using open source software in products and open source license compliance
considerations for open source contributions and projects

The goal of this session is to provide basic foundation knowledge of open source software upon which to start building policy, process and practices within your organization. We will also leave time for Q&A.

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,990
alright okay so so next I want to talk a

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,430
little bit about open source projects

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,320
and sort of how they're structured and

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,840
you know what building materials are

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,939
used and so forth and so them I think

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,880
there's a tendency to this thing all of

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,769
the sorts of projects are like Linux

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,600
that's actually not true in fact I think

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:35,489
probably Studies on this but probably

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,100
most of those projects are sort of you

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,829
know one person in it or maybe a couple

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,020
of people writing some code that they

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,739
think is useful and then putting on

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:55,170
github or whatever and then in May or

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:56,879
you may not even be you may also have

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,949
some projects that have more distributed

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,440
contributors so you have no meeting no

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,049
formal governments in assortment like a

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,939
formal way but have some kind of

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,799
hierarchy in terms of sort of food where

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,210
these patches and contributions like the

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,340
maybe maintain earth and then

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,049
contributors and you kind of move your

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,100
position to be a maintainer this is

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,130
basically how it exists is structure and

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,810
I know that may be documented in terms

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,490
of sort of how you become a maintainer

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,490
and so forth is long but there's no

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,580
and then I can find an inspiration we

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,780
also have more sort of formal governance

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,420
in terms of there's an actual

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,700
organizations that could be a non-profit

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,590
or foundation right so because having

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,229
some projects under its umbrella or

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,340
Linux Foundation or you have you know

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,080
their foundations others have like

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,360
specific to that project a fantastic

00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,640
software foundation Eclipse you may have

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,710
maybe a corporation's project that they

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,700
put out so there's you know it's sort of

00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,440
a one point of contact at services

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,960
visible and then that may be or may not

00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,550
and then also include sort of for what I

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
call formal governance right so there

00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,970
might be like a governing board you know

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,470
a technic spirit Lee there may be other

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,640
committees in it and then usually

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,860
there's like a charter this which are

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,480
defining those kind of roles who needs

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,430
to be on the government work you know

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,280
and what are the voting rights and so

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,550
forth and so on and and you don't so say

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,530
that was some kind of like membership

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,270
dues and I think sometimes people that

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,450
would sort of hear like oh you know that

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,650
seems a corporator that seems like not

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,830
free or whatever but you know someone's

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,590
gonna kick the lights on it so there's a

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,000
cost to maintain

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,230
you know whatever so you know how do you

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,540
pay for that right you've got to have

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,670
some some way to do that so that so this

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,019
is it's been interesting I've been

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,599
involved in two projects we're a long

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,680
time and one is sort of more like

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,150
grassroots if you will and doesn't have

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,739
that

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,709
what does and one other things that have

00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,290
any money for dedicated to a project is

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:06,709
anything like hire a marketing person

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:08,450
boy this up take the the other thing I

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,549
want to talk in more detail about is

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,040
sort of I put agreement is really

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,799
licenses and I'll explain why I didn't

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,930
say license on that top level but really

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,040
really important concept to think about

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,790
especially if you're getting these

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,500
important like contributing the projects

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,840
regardless of the scrunch structure when

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,719
it's one person or you know a very

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,629
formal project under like a foundation

00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:34,040
umbrella is there two licenses involved

00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,230
with every project okay

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,790
now maybe it looks like one but there's

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,470
two license this is an inbound license

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,690
and outbound license meaning the in

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,659
email is is license under which you

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,909
contribute to the project so the project

00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,829
I think it's great I like I mean it's

00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,549
very prevalent continue to what license

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,599
terms governs my contribution and then

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,329
and then on the other end

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,040
sandy picks up massive project and what

00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,449
lessons governs have terms under which

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,699
he uses it right that's the outbound

00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:07,579
license it's inbound relative to the

00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:09,590
project itself and it's really such an

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,419
important understand that concept as a

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,129
starting point and then there's sort of

00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,389
you know the alcohol license part

00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,829
someone easy usually right we're

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,209
familiar with this all licenses we're

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:21,049
talking about it's an open-source

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,150
license but the import license can vary

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,949
and it's worth three flavors it might be

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,720
an assignment which is not a license at

00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,550
the transfer rates of my set agreements

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
at the top it might be a contributor

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,580
license which is a license that is

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,590
essentially the license of different

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,940
than the outbound license and it might

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,310
just be saying that's out there and so

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,720
that in many fields I found is where

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,310
things get a little confusing so it'll

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,139
only come one lesson well there's sort

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,770
of two I mean you know it's just the

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,450
same one applies in two scenarios so so

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,450
let's just talk a little bit about each

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:53,840
of these and some of the things you see

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,460
so assignment is a transfer the transfer

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,710
of all rights it has to be in writing

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,389
generally most jurisdictions it's it's

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,810
usually it's unconditional right you're

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,849
like giving your copyright away those

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,770
these agreements may also include an

00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:09,430
explicit patent license you know that's

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,449
gonna be different in this case and then

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,760
the so the contributors world

00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:15,710
languishing your copyright usually and

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,260
then there's also a license back so I

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,909
assign my rights to you and then the

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,949
project says I give you a license back

00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,690
so you so usually it's still sort of

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,979
effectively do what you want with that

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,800
code but you don't only copyright

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,599
anymore so it's obviously like the

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:36,169
ultimate control for the project main

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:39,099
camera this is the ultimate these aboard

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:41,240
symmetrical or asymmetries the ultimate

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,789
asymmetrical thing right i mean the the

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,409
maintainer had only control and the

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:50,440
contributor doesn't have a country

00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:50,440
anymore so

00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,440
and then the other important thing about

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,700
that is only that I should have

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,100
mentioned where atomic cover lies only

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,500
the copyright lawyer can enforce the

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,060
copyrights so when you have a whole

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,540
bunch of copyright order as anyone can

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,910
enforce if you've assigned it then only

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,710
that and taken in court so the Free

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,810
Software Foundation for their projects

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,020
requires covering Simon this is one of

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,260
the reasons they do that now you know

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,710
you regardless of your size size are not

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,630
really what highly you know well upon

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,790
it's kind of a lot of like psychos entry

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,430
right it's already okay you gotta find

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:32,040
it but the FSS you know when they are

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,470
nonprofit with a public interest good

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,210
you know under US tax law and so and

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,950
they have the goal to ensure freedom and

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,300
said they and they want it to be easier

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,980
to enforce we can read about why they

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,320
chose I'm excited but you also see other

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,910
other types of entities so for example

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,480
Oracle has an assigned a room it's

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:53,100
actually a joint assignment more tricky

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,950
um and so sorry I don't see it that

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,060
often but but it is out there okay so

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,210
there are some big projects obviously

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,130
gonna be a big project and and you know

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,800
you're gonna want to have legal review

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,180
of that basically and it can actually

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
create some tricky things down the road

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,720
but I think there's a some confusion

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,760
I've seen developers just all assignment

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,889
comics the contributor agreement same

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,419
thing

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,789
controlling words and was not the same

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,909
thing it is a pretty distinct little

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:25,189
difference anywhere so more commonly

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,289
you're gonna see is perturb your license

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,999
agreements there was a CL a little of

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,430
afternoon so that's appreciation for

00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:34,759
that the copyright remains with the

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,949
contributor and then but the contributor

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,740
grants very broad rights to the project

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,499
maintainer with basically no conditions

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,969
right so as opposed to saying I grant

00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,680
you the right to copy but you provide a

00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,900
copy of licenses hydrating right there

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,750
copy it sort of stop there

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,479
and what that does is it gives the

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,310
maintainer that the opportunity to sort

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,469
of change the license essentially I mean

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,990
I think this is the thing is sort of

00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:02,150
argument for having to CLA it that way

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,900
because if you think about it right I

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:08,120
mean anytime you have a license coming

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,650
in and I keep coming in and I've been

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,599
going out you have but you can't have

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,620
like it narrower coming in and wide are

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
coming out it's got to be like this

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,939
right so you can see if it's broad

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:22,550
Randall rates and then you can you know

00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:24,110
use anyway sort of and so again this is

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,550
sort of more control for the project

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,139
maintainer but the could the contributor

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,819
can still do whatever they want with it

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,050
themselves they can license their coding

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,939
different way so they could contribute

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,229
over here and they can contribute over

00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,409
here or lease it under their license

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:39,110
over here and it's their copyright but

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:43,570
it is it is asymmetrical as well so it

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,570
is seen as sort of fun you know

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,110
it doesn't create equal rights and and

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,970
that's it that's a thing about comes in

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,880
that philosophical piece and there's

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,290
also a bit of an administrative burden

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,089
there now a couple things about

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,329
so to it's a couple things so so one is

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,270
if you have an assignment agreement and

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:05,370
humans see like what

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,790
because what they have in common you

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,440
have to have an entity to have this

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,370
agreement with races you can't really

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,040
have a distributed project with lots of

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,140
different developers and then have a CLA

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,279
because who you gotta sign the CLA to

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,770
somewhere if they're like you think

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,990
you're giving cutlery to someone so

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,720
you're not gonna see me oh so the no CLA

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,040
for links because who would hold up me

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,680
maybe the winnings funny bit

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,500
Linux never had a CLA I'm gonna have a

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,760
CLA and it's inbound outbound GPL - so

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,110
there's a nice sort of the starting

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,580
point you know if you're starting time

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,410
like we saw the CLA I believe like okay

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,630
well who who's the entity that the

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:51,870
contributors are licensing we're

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:55,470
assigning to the other thing is is that

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,360
there isn't a standard body of C lays

00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,310
like there are you know we talked about

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,540
that less I approved licenses you nobody

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,160
knows you kind of get to know these

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,360
licenses they're like a friend and it's

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,740
a million times

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,899
there is a the Apache foundation has a

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,279
CLA they have two variants of it a

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:18,029
corporate CLA and an individual ceiling

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:21,540
depending on from signing and so lots of

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:23,070
people have copied back and in some ways

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,259
that seems good or actually I should

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,259
think on the screen beliefs aside

00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,999
but it's also become I think actually

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,259
traded almost more of administrative

00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:34,869
burden because what happens is you can't

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,309
use it exactly the way it's worded from

00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:37,689
the Apache Software Foundation there are

00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:39,579
nonprofit so they're sort of warning in

00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:42,639
there that this will work say or written

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:45,399
or for other entities so you have to

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,199
change something so then as a lawyer

00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,009
I've spent a ridiculous amount of time

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:53,139
like doing a like a merge of compare how

00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,929
different is it and what is what are the

00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,209
changes what does that mean so there's

00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,100
that and you know again when something

00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,569
looks really similar to me it's familiar

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,629
it's almost sometimes harder to spot the

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:07,449
differences so I really like that a long

00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:09,129
time the other thing that's happened is

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:12,489
one of the things that people that like

00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:14,049
about CLA is was that this sort of

00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:16,600
administrative burden sort of this you

00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,980
know high barrier to entry and because

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,150
you have to sign this thing and then you

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,620
pieces of paper floating around

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:26,089
so what some really you know of course

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,000
engineers like to solve problems so

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:32,839
we've seen a rise of sort of automated

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,950
signing for ceilings and you know at

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,480
first I kind of thought well that's

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,860
that's kind of good that reduces the

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,600
administrative burden actually sort of

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,120
news you know that our way of tracking

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,800
like consign if you didn't sign but the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,120
problem with that is if you're

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,180
contributing as an employee who signs

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,000
right if it's if it's a good there's

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,500
some really clever things trigger on a

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,750
github pull request and say oh you go

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,100
and sign this and then it or see the

00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,870
sign it well now you met the developer

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,130
signing is a developer and authorized

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,270
signatory are you an authorized

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,180
signature for your company how many

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:13,580
people are authorizing the transmitter

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:24,190
you are one I'm surprised of one right

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:24,190
you're not right sorry you're not right

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,810
you can't find semen legally that would

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,620
be crazy kind of control that of the

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,720
company so so one of the arguments in

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,190
the past why lawyers like CLA is like

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,710
one thing we knew even a signature you

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:46,310
know that company actually knows they're

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,200
giving these rights up one one engine

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,670
area I work with have a great point of

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,220
saying also that you know really great

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,860
when your legal department is sort of

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,660
the gate for what the lack of process I

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,820
mean you know this is not how to be in

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,760
my opinion great education and training

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,140
and you can power your engineers educate

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,520
them you know and then when there is a

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,470
CoA it should be reviewed by our legal

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,000
department absolutely and then someone

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,680
who has proper authority to should sign

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,680
it in vitamin E that's my personal view

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,140
I think it's really unfair quite frankly

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,420
under to make your employees sign with a

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,680
representation that they have permission

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,890
from they're coming because that's the

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,080
sort of legal work around and some of

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,730
those drafted are really not mislead

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,170
drafted so well so I've did that I'm

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,560
concerned because it's seeing sort of

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,730
rise in the you sociales and then it's

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,650
like in trying to get rid of one

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,840
administrative burden by not having a

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,520
piece of paper and signatures by

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,440
automating it with these signatures

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,210
which is like I said sounds good it on

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,790
its face I sort of created like another

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,710
potential set of problems or not

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,170
problems it just sort of things that may

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:53,450
not be fantastic way of going about

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:55,850
things so anyway there's also this idea

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,790
that ceiling gets some some kind of

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,830
surety of IP rights and I also have a

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,240
really like to poke at that I have yet

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,970
to have a litter tell me exactly what

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,260
they mean by that because that to me

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,170
sounds like you're saying that you don't

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,370
think the IP rights branded in

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,660
found license there good enough so you

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,630
gotta like wrap something else around

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,519
friend and you've got the same saying so

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,290
I don't know I mean I think my point is

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,430
I have to go on in this feeling so I'm

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,910
going to hopefully write a paper about

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,010
this is a is this you know there are

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,410
good reasons that use a CLA but like

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,910
they be honest of why they're using it

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,500
and make sure that's I think there's an

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,589
actual real reason you know there's

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,910
there's something that's like founded in

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:36,970
crap and then you're executing it in a

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,250
way that supports that readings I think

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,980
there's something like this music

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,510
because that's where real projects you

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,550
need to control and control many

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,870
villains and if you don't have to have

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,329
that much more control then it's much

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,589
easier to dismiss the same license and

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:55,570
this is for sure I think the most common

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,010
muddled the copyright again remains as

00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,750
each contributor the country to the

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,350
projects on the same license is outbound

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,990
license its you know provides it's very

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,519
equal right it's easy to understand

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,949
because usually those are the licenses

00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,139
we've almost see red before so it's a

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,269
little it's gonna be a lot faster for

00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,130
your legal department internally if

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:17,230
they're an actor like oh it's found out

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,820
that VSP Fazal I know what the sp3 law

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,070
says I'm not doing something crazy with

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,140
what the heck does a ca-caw say it's

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,610
more accessible if you're developers I

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,370
don't have a lawyer because you know

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,020
what that license means essentially it

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,480
does mean that there's not as much

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,760
your project maintainer so there are

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,460
documented examples of DLC he was a

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,320
great example some years ago today they

00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,420
went to change their license actually

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,830
elegans the process of things now and in

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,420
order to do the tough do definitely get

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,800
the permission of every copy or over so

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,660
here a really successful project that's

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,120
a lot of people and I never talking to

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,130
someone like in the past thing well why

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,660
would you ever do that well you know

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,840
choose your choose your license widely I

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,250
mean you can do it it's ahead any but

00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,530
maybe that's a good thing that you can't

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,180
change the license easily all these kind

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,970
of things you weigh out and then the

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,710
other thing that you see is the

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,270
developer certificate ordinances using

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,720
Linux there's a whole interesting

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:13,210
history behind this I'm gonna totally

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,590
they're going to that it's it's um it's

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,080
sort of creating personal accountability

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,400
so it's not something that was ever

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,650
intended for somebody or employer to

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,970
sign it and they wanted developer the

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,890
kind of person accountable and it's

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,180
really like a cat test station so it

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,860
says I search on your really

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,440
representational a tortoise I certify

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,390
that basically what I'm submitting is

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,280
mine or I have the rights to doing and

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,530
it also has an interesting thing about

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,100
the contribution name will be maintained

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,420
saying like I'm okay my associate and

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,220
what they were trying to do in the in or

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,170
that that was really be able to know

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,090
where all the concentrations coming into

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,610
Linux came from part practically

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,530
speaking in case anything ever needed

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,530
pulled people out that was that was sort

00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:56,740
of where but the developers really liked

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:59,200
it um I don't really have a strong

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,150
feeling either way some people say it's

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,590
kind of like a CLA late but it's not

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,060
really a license there's no there's no

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,690
license grants in it it's just like this

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,929
attestation like I did this and then the

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,269
signed off by you

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,750
so it has been clean your main house

00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:17,699
include naturally so I think you know I

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,980
think that's that's already tested in

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,850
court but my view is like developers

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,649
like it and they want is it great the

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,260
other thing that you're seeing on major

00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:30,539
arising in projects is a code of conduct

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,299
this is a legal agreement it's more of a

00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,889
policy you know set of guidelines we

00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,500
just stopped this sort of social in the

00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:44,010
paper forms and some time enforcement or

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,929
never and this is a real response to

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:49,320
kind of you know projects are considered

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:52,350
a meritocracy and meaning it's an urn

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,299
your body putting a good code and and

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,919
then there's sort of became examples of

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,389
sort of egregious behavior by some

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,429
pretty high-profile with maintained errs

00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,570
and that they kind of got you know this

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,669
feeling like people get that they do

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,620
really good work they kind of get a past

00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:08,760
we haven't seen examples of this

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,380
anywhere else in society and and so

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,940
people start realizing that that you

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,590
know that there can be a really hostile

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,630
environment it could be really

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,700
unfriendly and then that there's just

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,460
this total lack of diversity in open

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,370
source projects also is really even

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,840
worse and talk about like women and stem

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,580
that's that it's like even worse if it's

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,460
our software I mean with some really

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,289
interesting statistics on that and that

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,580
that sort of hostile environment earth a

00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:34,409
ton from the environment actually does

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,600
end up having a sort of disproportionate

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,440
effect on people who are highly

00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,510
represented

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,750
he said there's really been a big push

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:47,280
as a something called it cuz it's like

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,410
put of conduct coming in or there's

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,910
someone wrote one and it's been various

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,650
things we made it like a template that

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,420
anyone can pick up and actually very

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,250
famously just recently money think that

00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:00,180
looks really really big deal if they

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:04,050
haven't done that but I will say as a

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:06,030
woman in this space and conversations

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:15,120
but can we just all just be done it's

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:18,360
like it's not and if you don't have some

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,810
kind of written like hey this is how you

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,500
behave then you don't have anything to

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:27,210
enforce against when someone doesn't and

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,040
and that enforcement piece is important

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,360
so I think that the other thing is if

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,280
you're gonna put a code of conduct in

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,570
place and you got to be real about what

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,260
are you gonna do is it's not comfortable

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,820
right now

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,000
what do you how are you gonna deal with

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,950
it when someone doesn't abide by famous

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,390
it is the same thing with the events

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,270
right this event was a code of conduct

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,040
and I I remember being something like do

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,990
we really need to tell people you know

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,810
no actually do need to tell people not

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,690
to use explicit photos in their

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:58,260
presentation

00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,330
raster right I mean you kind of love

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,530
like really like you know what you think

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,780
don't you

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:07,530
it's just like professionalism to some

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,669
degree but yeah you know but the other

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,230
thing actually interesting about this I

00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:12,539
think I had this later on is it if you

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,549
are putting kind of other projects out

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,710
there as a company you probably have a

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,880
policy that kind of covers this more

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,580
broader right you probably have

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,289
something you know maybe public speakers

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,880
have training or some kind of review or

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,200
you have service social media policy and

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,490
a lot of times like those overlap so

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,409
another good thing we have a lot of

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,020
people talk about this policy is policy

00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,460
we already have policies like cover open

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,890
source we just read it so you know don't

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,090
don't make more policies right like take

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,380
me back of what you know what you

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,490
already have but you know if you're

00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,130
putting a project out there than that

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,510
this is really for white people and then

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,780
of course you may have these membership

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,130
agreements and project charters it's a

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,750
formal governments and they're usually

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,520
going to state like the missions and

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,500
goals and set up membership types and

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,020
then you know establish a voting rights

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,090
and how that operates and important and

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,830
stuff like that and them and usually the

00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,909
IEP sections pilot bring a rather

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,770
lightweight sixth thing that other

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,450
collaborative groups like standards

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,100
bodies and it's really heavy on i.t

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,419
stuff but a lot of times it just like

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,850
it's going to be whatever the license is

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,830
in the code or maybe it states a license

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,120
in there and then that kind of creates a

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:18,900
my feet so that the project will change

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:21,570
that's a bad thing but you know those

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,960
need to be reviewed those need to be

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:26,160
reviewed because you know figuring out

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,380
this is our different type of legal or

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,180
being you know if you're joining and you

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,040
don't need a certain level and sometimes

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,570
you have things complicated like if

00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,910
there's this many members at this level

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,560
and you get certain one representative

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,030
and if you vote at all you know so you

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,440
want to know what you're signing to and

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:44,850
and it's sort of what you're paying for

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,170
all right so that's where I thought I

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,870
was gonna get it before obviously I'm

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,850
super running behind we have lunch in

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,090
like ten minutes

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:56,040
I'm sucking faster and faster so I'll

00:21:54,090 --> 00:22:10,250
try to get through this I really wanted

00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:13,290
more time for questions but alright so

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,370
how the organization's engage or use it

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,050
open source software so it's really

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,280
happy to see some you know everybody

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,800
doesn't different take on this and

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,890
excellent guy this morning spoken like

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,570
really similar as we noticed this is my

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,550
favorite little graphic and reading

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,470
different ways over and over so I like

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,670
to think of there's a three buckets or

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,740
doesn't mean that there aren't things

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,620
that sort of fall in between or cover

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,360
boats but so consume is using open

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,070
source like and this could be internal

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,560
use like using you know Linux and their

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,460
servers or Libre Office on your desktop

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,320
or whatever and then use in your prime

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,790
so that external distribution right you

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,410
know you've got a product and how

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:53,160
software in it and it goes out the door

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:55,170
and then contribute is contributing to

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,940
be contributing to existing open source

00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,860
projects so that could be as an

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,260
employee's again this was talked about

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,870
this morning or you know on behalf of

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,680
the company or on your own time and then

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:10,300
also joining a project right

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,770
it's back to us or if you have a formal

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,240
membership and you live in the country

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,470
where you may be contributing a lot so

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,060
if you sign up to this degree

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,230
and then creating it open source

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,990
projects and when you're putting your

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,870
own code out surplices then at the

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,190
center of that you have some roles and

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:28,720
responsibilities from an illness and a

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,190
resource for expertise and you know this

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,420
would be commonly called reverse or

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,280
further methods that are setting

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,900
strategies providing guidance and

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,140
providing some internal governance

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,860
around all of these things okay so let's

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,360
talk about the consume side so the

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,430
biggest thing here is open source

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,620
license compliance out and it's take a

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,260
time how many I hadn't heard a lot about

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,810
in some places compliance in this

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,890
session so how many people have already

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,890
heard this to be able

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,030
all right Oh keep going so in order to

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,500
comply all the license and we kind of

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,700
like sort of working backwards you have

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,800
to first of all you have to know what

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,410
you're using right and then you have to

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,630
know what license applies to those are

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,740
so pretty amazing and then you have to

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,570
know and this was another one that

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,690
people go on to sober all the time how

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,990
are you using it right because because

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,400
how you're using it what lessons applies

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,750
then tells you what conditions are

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,180
triggered what do you have to do to

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,390
comply with license right so how do you

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,530
know what you're using the the challenge

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,420
where was our software sort of

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,000
traditionally some dating myself of

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,710
having a child and still is that there's

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
a lot of times into money involved right

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,310
and so if you have a lot of companies

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,880
already have systems about procurement

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:46,260
well there's no money involved it's like

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,010
your developers are using whether you

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,280
know they are not

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,590
let's make lawyers very very nervous but

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,330
but that is the powerful reality and so

00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:59,130
you've gotta have you know some kind of

00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:01,380
a process in place to and then the other

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,540
thing is like what license applies right

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,320
so we even think I go it's this open

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,430
such package is under MIT actually the

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,710
randomly you might look a little bit

00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:14,700
more like this open source software is

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,110
sort of incestuous and in there to me a

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,880
lot of other things are bundled there

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,900
too many dependencies it's pulling in I

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,090
mean it's become more and more

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,820
complicated with the you know as

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,520
technology changes so and then they are

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,679
even worse thing is then sometimes the

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,570
license is actually in the file sometime

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,379
it's not sometimes it's not really

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,879
obvious to do audits it's they go on and

00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:37,889
on and all that if I don't want to scare

00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:39,179
you you know but it's not always

00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,350
straightforward it's sort of the take

00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,480
away and this is where life again

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,249
license scanning tools I say license

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,899
scanning tools there are different types

00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:47,549
of scanning tools or commercial scanning

00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,049
tools Angeles can source code looking

00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:51,539
for source code about just if you're

00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,100
looking from licenses then you want to

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,210
listen skin do different types of

00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,850
scanning different types of tools

00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,080
different types of caches if you have

00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,879
the source code and you're looking for

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,869
license and a license getting to maybe

00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:05,700
probably be a better thing and you know

00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,409
this is a little plugin that we've

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,330
talked a lot so a lot about up streaming

00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:12,119
so if you do find something you can't

00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,039
figure out those the licenses upstream

00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,929
that knowledge right I think my entire

00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,159
github history is me asking what the

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,009
license is either inbound or outbound

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,480
and hopefully then you can fix that for

00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:22,860
like the next person because sometimes

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,110
you figured out any kind of you know

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,559
that knowledge doesn't get too populated

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,450
into into the project so this is a case

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,909
where they had referred to a license

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,909
file and then there was no licensure

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,360
the other thing you might see is

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,070
multiple licenses so it can be a couple

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,320
different flavors and the language isn't

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,680
always very clear and I'll give you a

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,380
hint

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,720
these and/or and wind terms are also

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,370
from the SPX project hopefully all the

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,610
time to tell you probably less applause

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,950
agreement but basically sometimes you

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,690
have an end scenario right so multiple

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,100
licenses applies the code you must

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,330
comply with all of them and see they

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,980
certainly where things might be an

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,960
example of GPL it looks like some

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,120
project license you have stuff in there

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,320
it's BSD and sort of the DP elements

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,150
like you think it was wrapping around

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,360
the BSD Claudia picket lines of course

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:15,730
it'll easy to comply with both we've got

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,240
some some returns or is like you have a

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:23,410
choice and so you might say you can take

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,170
this under Mozilla Public License or MIT

00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:28,240
here I don't know whatever and then

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,430
annoyingly sometimes they're not really

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,230
good about using the word order or

00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,940
either or those kind of words that make

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:39,420
it obvious their choice sometimes these

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:41,800
were and when it's going or words

00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,420
sometimes it's kind of obvious if it's

00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,950
to open-source licenses it would make

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,030
sense top of those apply in there that

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,040
are clearly trying to give you a choice

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,960
widely projects do this they're trying

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,820
to you know increase uptake of the

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,780
project and they're being sensitive that

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,900
people want to use this in different

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,400
places that may have sort of potential

00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,620
in compatibility problems with the

00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,970
licenses and so they're trying to put

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,310
sort of getting these got these options

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,640
the other or scenario you hear about is

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,960
many are dual licensing again dual what

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,660
is that

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,630
and or a lot of times it's referring to

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,150
a more business model rate offering an

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,560
open-source version usually under a

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,660
copyleft license and then a commercial

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,250
license and those people really like to

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,410
think of a copy like with me you know

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,210
copyright maximalist right because the

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,150
stronger the copyleft license is more

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,920
likely they can get you to buy the more

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,840
choice there's nothing wrong with that

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,730
business model all that I have seen a

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,380
fair amount of sort of interesting

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,600
interpretations on those licenses on

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,660
there I think companies I have my house

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,070
so you know something again you do your

00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,690
own analysis of the license and how

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:48,210
you're using it it may not always take

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,130
that value and then you also have this

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,990
is a really a I didn't know where else

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,180
to put this so you may have additional

00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,370
terms and exceptions this traditionally

00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:59,090
started with the GPL license because

00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,920
there's some of those copyleft you know

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,470
provisions and sometimes you know four

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,730
greatest examples of GCC is a compiler

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,410
they wanted to make sure it's clearly

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,750
committed output Pilar was a little

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,910
decal so they have this very specific

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,740
exception to the GPL for that scenario

00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,750
and so that's kind of like a wig so it's

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,660
like GPL with this exception and you see

00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:21,210
other variations on that and so they

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,980
sort of modified and and you know and

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,320
then you kind of get into is it now not

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,520
an open-source license

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,990
again be wary at that so the analysis I

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,640
would do so we talk about what you know

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,830
what are using and what license applies

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,930
and how we're using it gonna get that

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,610
minute but you can kind of think of it

00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:42,450
as like an if then statement so you know

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:44,790
if I'm doing XYZ then I have to do this

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,980
if what's the triggers or what's the

00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,390
usage model and then what's the what's

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,400
the what's of thing you got to do what's

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,950
the condition of the requirement and

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,240
then how does that requirement need to

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,480
be met so that's been some kind of new

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,700
sort of like the Devils in the details

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,130
so how are you the open source software

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,460
so distribution is like the most common

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:08,160
trigger right so and distribution is is

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,050
you know changing Hans's as I did this

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,090
to you I think some I don't see as much

00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,590
confusion about this before you know

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:18,750
again that is actually a legal term a

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:20,310
bar vibrated act and sometimes I've

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,650
heard people say like oh I'm not selling

00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,180
me this delusion I've heard that a long

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,470
time I think people are more clear on

00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,360
that

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,520
you know GPL very clearly says other

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,250
acts are covered running the programs

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,910
are using internally not not covered or

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:38,550
not restricted no conditions on that the

00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:44,540
more tricky question is if you have a

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:48,980
SAS platform is that a distribution so

00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:50,970
there's a really strong yes/no answer

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,440
generally speaking most open source

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,510
license is like I said trigger on

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,949
distribution if I'm hosting a web

00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:01,219
application online

00:30:56,949 --> 00:31:03,229
let's get control then I'm not mister be

00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:05,599
encoded by mark right but some code is

00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,889
distributed and you know JavaScript ends

00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,569
up on that music you might have some

00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:11,269
like client or some application that

00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:13,489
works with your sass platform and so so

00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,079
you have to you need it seemed like all

00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:16,729
that stuff we don't worry about it no

00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,199
you still to do the analysis I mean it

00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:20,809
most interesting thing years ago they

00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:22,459
did an audit on application and they had

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,929
to use models and they have a lot more

00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:26,359
they discriminate literally shipped and

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:28,279
they hosted platform and we did two

00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,109
different compliance analysis and you

00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:32,389
know the list of compliance requirements

00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:35,959
with sass the solution was this long and

00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:40,369
the list goes on there are some licenses

00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:43,699
affero GPL the most famous that trigger

00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:47,329
on distribution over a network or access

00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:50,629
via TV so that's so is and that's a big

00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:55,129
penis or the debate on how to handle uh

00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:56,599
it's it's not actually as some people

00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:58,609
make it but it's just something you need

00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,889
to be aware of but the other thing even

00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:02,449
where it is when you're huge changes so

00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:04,339
this is the other thing I think people

00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:05,599
you have to do to comply with listens

00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,739
and they don't talk about the news feeds

00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,259
and they don't talk about these K

00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:11,869
standing so having blanket rules or

00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:13,399
whitelist or so forth in your processes

00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:14,929
in your company will I oh that's free

00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,729
and efficient you got to make sure you

00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:19,519
cover all those questions you never say

00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:21,349
MIT is great well maybe MIT is great in

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,450
certain in what scenario goes with what

00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:25,790
products

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:29,420
and then modifications is the other big

00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:31,790
trigger if you change the program then a

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,220
lot of licenses that some of the missed

00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,900
ones make say you need to make notice if

00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,760
your modifications out good engineering

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:43,670
practices would be that you would track

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:45,020
this anyway so that shouldn't be so so

00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,460
what kind of conditions are triggered

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,800
this is a sort of like a list of really

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,480
common license conditions so you know

00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,160
retaining the copyright notices you

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,990
shouldn't strip out copyright notice if

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,700
anyway providing a copy the license

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,580
major there's some specific attribution

00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,260
language they want you to notice

00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,350
modifications I mentioned then of course

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,430
copyleft is in the lighter blue

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:08,170
providing access that source kind of

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:10,400
maintaining a modified version is under

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,680
the same license and then you may have

00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,650
other terms like that aren't really an

00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,660
active condition that something like

00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,430
don't use a trademark maybe we talked

00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,200
about that earlier you can't restrict

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,200
the rights granted so that's really

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,320
to sort of retain that freedom for the

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,960
next users if you've got your own

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,460
license sort of included it that

00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,090
includes open source and you've got to

00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,890
kind of carve out and termination

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,630
clauses if you crazy once that's pretty

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:43,540
straightforward

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,540
okay I have totally run out of time so

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:49,120
let's wrap up this part and not leave

00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,120
you hanging

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,480
so another thing I mentioned earlier of

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,390
derivative works and this is like a

00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,020
million dollar question I mean this

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,970
really kind of cuts to GPL and I would

00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,470
say you know the definition may vary by

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,230
the license but you know what about the

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,160
legal definition there's a low judicial

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,090
opinion there's the case of the kind of

00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,000
part of the circulate through the court

00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:17,660
but we never got an opinion on what

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,250
constitutes a drip or under GPL and the

00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,750
thing I was starting to allude to

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,970
earlier and I talked about the

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,160
derivative work is under US law so it's

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:28,880
a legal term revoir it's a fact based

00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:32,120
case-by-case analysis so always tell

00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,370
developers is I know it drives me nuts

00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,560
when lawyers say well it depends but it

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:40,160
does depend and there's just not really

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,780
an answer and so you know but the good

00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,370
news is is that there's a whole bunch of

00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,100
guidance out there in the source

00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:49,670
community in particular by the license

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,860
authors so you know deficit is going to

00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,410
be probably who you want it might want

00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,700
to you know look to in terms of how this

00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,760
is interpreted and you know they may be

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,700
wrong a judge may totally disagree with

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,290
but if you want that's sort of a good

00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,619
place to start so I think what it comes

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,030
to is you know your position is going to

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:09,130
be based on some you know legal

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,810
interpretations in practical reality and

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,310
you know sort of a risk assessment you

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,090
want to be the test case without or not

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:20,890
what what what software you're involved

00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:22,840
and so on but yeah it's a lot of I mean

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,160
even even some of those experience of

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,570
the sort of lawyers on this agree on

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,390
this so it's just a bit of a fuzzier but

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,730
there are like I said there's like tree

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,710
practice and dreams the other thing I'll

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:37,240
mention is license compatibility this is

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,070
another one of those project when there

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,109
was topics that people just throw out

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,930
like how this is a super scary thing

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:46,480
there was a talk that Richard Fontana is

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,609
a lawyer but I gave at Boston some years

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,890
ago and he's title of his talk which I

00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:53,050
love was taking license compatibility

00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,050
semis seriously which i think is about

00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:00,340
right you know your takeaway here

00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:01,750
because license compatibility only it

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,100
only is a question in certain

00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,040
circumstances again when we sort of

00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,380
sometimes skip the point so if you

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,720
create a derivative work or combining

00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,760
code under different licenses now you

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,590
gotta start thinking about that you may

00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,690
be you know using code under different

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,430
licenses but not the way that even

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,950
raises this question so you got to start

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,600
buying it dot wait and a lot of times

00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,820
again this is usually on the detail

00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,580
there's other licenses that got some

00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,960
turbulence and then and then there's a

00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,740
couple of flavors of it right there

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,390
could be the most

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,130
obviously it's like impossible to comply

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,580
with votes so like we've got code under

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,740
GPL

00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,740
which says if you make a directive or

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:44,050
code under like another license that

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,820
house that's super deal cut a license

00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:48,130
that says the same essentially says that

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,510
you gotta keep well you can't keep it

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,000
under the same license in two cases

00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,530
right that doesn't work so you know

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,650
that's some of the most blatant reason

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,270
there other than other things like the

00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,430
some licenses have this that you can't

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,080
have further you can't place for the

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:05,230
restriction on the Reg right here right

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,510
downstream users so you know you've got

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,340
other licenses that could be deemed

00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,500
that's a further restriction open their

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:14,290
interpretation of course there are some

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,440
perceived in compatibilities because the

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,540
FSF hasn't opinions on that again may or

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,710
may not have legal holding you're never

00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,330
going to see a case on that in my

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,460
opinions but do you want to you know if

00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,990
you want to create friction there and

00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,490
then obviously if you're in the

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,280
commercial realm and you're delivering

00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,840
products and you have a software product

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,670
where do you have your license and you

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,290
are also incorporating the source in it

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,030
then your employer needs to look at okay

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,060
you know what are the open-source

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:42,160
licenses involved and and and then what

00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,660
are our terms of our license line you

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,460
know alcohol site then the easiest thing

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,930
is to just like carve out with all that

00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,850
it absorbs right that is like the lazy

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,410
way about it because these open sourcing

00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,480
our product it's under their open source

00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,550
licenses it's not

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,160
right now you're just like eliminated

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,360
any possibility but there are these some

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,060
reasons you don't want to do abroad

00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,550
about or your you know the recipients

00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,140
are of your products aren't really happy

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:08,570
about that because 80% of your product

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,570
is open source and now they're basically

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:18,780
there's a drafting thing they're

00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:20,400
actually serious consideration

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,480
so I guess someone's gonna end up the

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,900
news I'm not talking about contributing

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,490
Clarence either times but but obviously

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,660
that and if you think about all these

00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,490
somebody's talked about it that's what's

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,380
licensed clients and how are using I

00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,520
just kind of skipped over internally use

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,290
by the way I'm going to say it on

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,850
beginning because that's not as much a

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,650
legal risk as much more likely more

00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,180
security risks it's really more some of

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,850
your IT department might want to worry

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,800
about sort of focusing more the things

00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:46,260
that go out the door but if you think

00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,630
about something all these things they

00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,280
have to do then you can start to see

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,990
what what does the process need to be

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,330
right so you need a system right need to

00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:57,060
be tracking the stuff may be a request

00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:59,850
and approval and you want to record

00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,560
certain info in there and then you want

00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,810
to make sure you maintain it you want to

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,390
keep the source code because sometimes

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,220
it disappears and

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,599
you are relying on some piece of code or

00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,549
maybe you downloaded a free compiled

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,260
binary and now you don't even know where

00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,809
it came from or you can't fulfill the

00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,400
obligation for the places so always go

00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,910
out and copy that the license as well

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,559
things you know URLs are not like

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,359
perpetual things always and then of

00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,740
course generating whatever license

00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,599
compliance artifacts that you need to

00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,480
deliver now you know I just really

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,400
really high-level put this slide up but

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,470
really what you just need to do is go

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,940
look at the contain specification so

00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:41,029
open chain is a project like I said

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,029
earlier that define is sort of drop

00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:45,329
minimum requirements for it with some

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,740
best practices per se there's the

00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,269
documentation on that thing so they're

00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,619
like here's like what you need to do to

00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:52,230
have a factor building services

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:54,930
compliance program and all this is laid

00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:58,140
out right so sort of silly to have it

00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:00,809
written in community routes and

00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:04,109
companies and coming together to agree

00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:05,519
on that and rate and form in nobody's to

00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:07,710
talk about it this place like a trade

00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,040
secret seven years

00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:12,390
we did how he managed open-source

00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,770
seriously people remember what coming

00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,089
single that's kind of at a competitive

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,619
advantage it's like are you serious like

00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:18,089
no let's just share this it's not a

00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,730
competitive advantage we should all be

00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:22,200
doing a good job because then we trust

00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:24,390
each other more in terms of the software

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,000
that were expanding and obviously

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:30,990
training is really really really worked

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,849
I don't think in kind of processes

00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,970
without training you don't have this

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:37,859
basic following the process and they

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:42,210
don't and danerys like to know why you

00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:44,750
know I find why we're doing this I know

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,750
I'm like that

00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:55,320
all right so all right so I think we're

00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,690
over I had a little more but I don't

00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:04,490
know how start me on it so I don't like

00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:06,750
positive yeah I do

00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,170
well leave just leave I won't be

00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:12,990
offended

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:15,080
is that okay all right so I don't have

00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,760
actually too many slides on this but

00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:23,910
this is repeated on a vertical slide so

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:26,370
it's concerning for me on some things

00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,650
you want to think about so why are you

00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,480
contributing what's the Joel is that it

00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,980
could be you know companies contribute

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,750
to focus of projects or for those two

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,430
reasons there could be to support a

00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,870
technology and an airline right at the

00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,640
surface critical care product or

00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,040
critical gear infrastructure or back-end

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,900
computer leads and

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,900
who's me to contribute to the health and

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,610
doctor product it could be a stickiness

00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,590
factor rates like enablement of other

00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:53,800
technology have that relies on open

00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:56,170
source that you want that sort of been

00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,240
able in factor it may be just you know

00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:02,530
reducing technical debt rates per few

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,360
people talk about using open source and

00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,110
then you make a patch maybe minor

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,300
changes and then now you've got to

00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,040
maintain your copy and you're not saying

00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,900
that upstream project and maybe there

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,760
other patches that you're missing out

00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,230
and so that's really not good practice

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,760
and this is like a really important

00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,530
point if I think a lot of companies come

00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,730
into open source on that consuming side

00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,560
right everybody takes it up the fuser

00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,480
that's like the most common thing it's

00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,590
really great to see the the penis

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,690
organization I think really in

00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:32,230
coordinating like the whole picture and

00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:33,640
and starting out you know I think now if

00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,320
your company sort of new to open source

00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,120
you kind of got people already sort of

00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,470
preaching like don't just consume like

00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,200
get back this it's like the whole

00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,970
picture rate and it might just be a good

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,650
thing to do I mean it may be totally not

00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,270
part of your business your IP strategy

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,340
at all but you just want to enable your

00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,900
developers have some like some time we

00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,010
can work on things that they like you

00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,369
know some companies have that sort of

00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,309
innovation time and

00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,720
that may be part of it or it's like

00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,339
contributing something that is a

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,339
corporate responsibilities thing that

00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:03,339
you find is a feel-good

00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:07,249
so obviously what are the legal

00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,660
requirements you know what's the inbound

00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:10,279
license right if you're contributing to

00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,749
a project and you want to know what am i

00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:13,400
contributing and like I said before

00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:16,099
finding the license can sometimes be

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,420
hard I think now all my github requests

00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,619
are like what's your in boundless and

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,940
it's because context will put the

00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:22,460
outbound license in there and then they

00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,200
won't stay explicitly and then you're

00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,910
like okay is it inbound or is there like

00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,140
a ceiling in somewhere that I can't find

00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,880
and I've had that happen where they

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,430
actually specially its automated ceiling

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,900
like oh there's no there's a CLA that'll

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,619
trigger once you go in for the court

00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:40,940
that's my photo

00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:42,109
you know I mean I sort of do that so but

00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,970
you know the key question is for

00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:46,249
companies you know why want to know them

00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,140
and you want to know what my opinion in

00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:51,079
a license do you know honestly if you're

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,940
like this a wide range of that way I

00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,130
mean I work for a very I think heavy

00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,660
company an arm I've also worked for a

00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,210
software company it was just like do it

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,670
everyone we don't care about we're

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,690
although I think sometimes it really

00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,430
comes down with like your kind of

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,230
portfolios but again it goes back to

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,910
like what is it that's important it's

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,829
your company and what is it that you

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,630
need to be protected in you clear them

00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:12,890
and then it should be easy to arrest I

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,869
mean you're having a heavyweight IP

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,000
review every single thing that goes out

00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:20,210
the door

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,680
an older son so so you want to start

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,620
with like you know boils that were

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,440
worried it on and sort of deescalate

00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,670
stuff and then you know expectations for

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:35,150
membership and whether it's like a

00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:38,660
formal membership or or project that has

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:40,340
some guidelines or whatever and then

00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,690
who's concerning right so are you

00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,580
coordinating efforts across your company

00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,520
so like even if you have a company

00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,190
that's really open and just this are

00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,140
like really and enables your developers

00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,400
you know I mean if you're a really small

00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,410
company your own what we're gonna do

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,660
fine but you might want to track this

00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:58,700
anyway because if you've got one group

00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,930
over here contributing and then this

00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,100
other group over here also could

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,690
reducing I think doesn't really look

00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,470
good it's like you bet you know so if

00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,700
you're like oh here he goes net right I

00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,100
mean not having some time but especially

00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,020
a big company so so you know there's an

00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,540
advantage of tracking this activity

00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,280
beyond the sort of IT concern right sort

00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,100
of like an efficiencies are you on the

00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,290
same page or not are you doing the same

00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,700
work somehow and then that sort of

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,620
reputational thing and you know the

00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,590
participation again mentioned like sort

00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,570
of social media policies or like my

00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,950
point about public participation to

00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,680
making sure your employees know that you

00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:40,640
know you are representing

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:42,700
don't make them like that so again in

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,050
process you know might want to have a

00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,700
request approval process maybe you have

00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,530
some areas on its bottom free but you

00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,990
know the target right again not just

00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:57,020
about managing risk also marketing how

00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:59,570
many probably contributing to that being

00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,590
a hiring drama right at noon starts

00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,240
developers on the new people are

00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:06,440
developers were the new team members and

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,630
as I said as well so they can be really

00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:15,770
high demand and they're gonna look at

00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:17,720
how friendly so creating the open source

00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:20,810
project is really lazy anything once on

00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,030
each of these could have like the slide

00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:24,560
tune but I was like to start off by

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,180
saying if you're releasing a new project

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,610
it can be kind of like running a small

00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,200
business and and that sounds kind of

00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,480
scary but I think it sort of almost good

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,910
to start with that thought because then

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,980
you can sort of play back back down from

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,350
there but there's a lot to consider the

00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,400
first part point is in a wired game so

00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,530
everything I just said about

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,870
contributing and engaging the community

00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:47,450
kind of applies like and then zones

00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,650
right so you know why are you doing this

00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,730
and how is it going to benefit your

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,930
company and what are you trying to

00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,490
achieve I mean what is it what do you

00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,420
want this what what success look like

00:46:52,490 --> 00:47:02,180
right when you put a product out there

00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:04,160
just sort of same thing then there's

00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,720
sort of that legal due diligence so

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,580
you know what are you putting out there

00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,380
do you want to license that under

00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,730
license so the same thing I just talked

00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,230
about you know making sure there's not

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,610
any confidential information in there or

00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,710
anything that you don't want out there

00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:18,350
whether it's about two years trade

00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:20,060
secrets deciding on that licensing model

00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,770
I see also a lot of company to think

00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:26,540
that for this this morning the building

00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:29,030
sizes that we that's really nice and

00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,340
consistent and it's easy something but I

00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,660
wouldn't use a one size fits all like I

00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,610
said all the lessons lessons are

00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,470
different and depending on the

00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,630
technology putting out there who's gonna

00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:40,190
pick it up what your goals are with it

00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,080
how other people are going to use it

00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,510
that's gonna dictate the license right

00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,760
so you may have a really good reason for

00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,710
using GPL or a really good reason for

00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,900
MIT sometimes you just want to use like

00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,640
the license that's similar to the other

00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,110
open-source they may use it with if it's

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,390
Linux you got a beacon you want to make

00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:59,330
sure you and some of that's like I said

00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,190
real incompatibility and some of it sort

00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:03,530
of perceived right I mean I remember

00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:05,060
playing on a project under Apache 2.0

00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:07,760
permissive license it was an eclipse

00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,200
plug-in usually Eclipse plugin for

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,840
Eclipse license there's no problem

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,940
between those two licenses and some

00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,410
really irritated that I was under Apache

00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,250
and just sort of made a big stink and

00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,250
you know it's just like

00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,140
so yeah this is those kind of things if

00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,000
you want to think about it sort of

00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,290
analytically and then the same thing

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,960
within about lessons you know do you

00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,970
want to use a CLA and why do you really

00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,290
need that you know if you're going

00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,640
inbound outbound you want to make that

00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,750
decision you want to make the right

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,100
decision I think don't want to have to

00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:41,870
change the license later and and you

00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,410
know there is this administrative

00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,000
overhead

00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,130
even with those assigning things that

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,350
ceilings and some stuff I think I would

00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:50,360
not have guessed that really was pretty

00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:53,150
intuitive what about ceiling it's very

00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,680
new I I really like gear away from them

00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:56,510
and what's their really strong reason

00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,120
you know and there are there are strong

00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,530
reasons that say their branding

00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,390
marketing you know do you wanna do you

00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,860
want to have a trade runner how are you

00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,030
gonna name your project maybe if you

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,400
donated something that's really

00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:08,660
different on someone else's trademark

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,650
maybe you want to put branding around it

00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,420
so you do want to file a trademark

00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,780
yourself or do care you just name it

00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:17,240
something like really descriptive

00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,990
there's a great site called Foss marks

00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,490
org

00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:22,120
I don't think about Lincoln here it's

00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,120
really good

00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:25,119
was a collaborative effort by several

00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,339
different attorneys different

00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,079
jurisdictions but having recommend code

00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,819
review you know what's the coding style

00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,289
cleaning up the code making sure

00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:35,890
everything is going to place creating

00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:37,809
documentation right you want your

00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:41,829
project documentation like always a weak

00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:44,229
spot a lot of projects does it build

00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:46,209
and then governments you know what are

00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:47,829
the processes for submitting code and

00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:49,119
who decides it's like the code of

00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:51,249
conduct where you have for conflict

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,650
resolution in terms of code or other

00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:55,150
issues you know who's in charge right I

00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,469
mean if this is your company's project

00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,289
or you know do you want to spin this out

00:49:56,469 --> 00:50:00,519
and put it under a foundation you know

00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:02,559
how's that going to work what's the

00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:04,359
hosting kind of infrastructure questions

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,949
I mean obviously a lot of people use

00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:08,650
github and there's on but then it was

00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:10,959
full of the choices and how remain you

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,369
want a second website and then want to

00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:15,519
maintain it you know do you have the

00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:17,349
resources to maintain it what happens if

00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,079
that person is maintaining your company

00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:20,939
then switches dogs and what happens

00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,539
really look good to have sort of

00:50:20,939 --> 00:50:24,539
Horseman projects

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,599
and so then finally we've got coming

00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:30,459
back to some of the open source program

00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:34,119
office or whatever your company might

00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:35,979
call it that's that centerpiece hug you

00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,569
know this this cuts across like all of

00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:39,489
these things right who is responsible

00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:41,920
for what do you have that properly

00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:44,229
resourced you know are you valuing open

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,089
source expertise in their company right

00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:48,219
that is a valuable source of expertise

00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:50,469
and a lot of times companies really

00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:52,029
struggle with how to value not only open

00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:54,190
source software itself but people who

00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:56,380
work in it because it's pretty isn't it

00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:58,059
sometimes as well as reason freedom and

00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:02,859
some people don't always have as much

00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:04,959
value for things so free and they know

00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:08,229
what what is it that's proteases even

00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:10,329
needed I mean it's very common to think

00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:11,589
of all the things I cover today and it's

00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:12,489
kind of almost asleep it's got the

00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:14,319
service right so it's not a

00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,880
one-dimensional area you know and as a

00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:24,219
lawyer I like that some people I know

00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:26,349
really science it you know so forth and

00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:27,759
so on and same thing with in engineering

00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,650
so you know its cross-functional you've

00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:31,690
got a really good open source program

00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,150
office is gonna have like people from

00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:37,479
these different areas rooms all sort of

00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:40,299
all coming together so a few things I've

00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:42,099
mentioned that very well

00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:43,359
I've been Shannon mentioned a lot I

00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,249
didn't really mention that to do group

00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,969
that has a lot of guidance related to

00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:50,499
open source community engagement early

00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:53,079
office a really good guidance there

00:51:50,499 --> 00:51:55,320
adopt foster I've mentioned yesterday as

00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,420
well don't reinvent the wheel

00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,090
use you know the thing that's happened

00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,800
now is like there's always been a lot of

00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,420
info out there but then you don't really

00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,340
know who wrote it and if it's sort of

00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,640
like reliable and there's you know

00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:11,640
there's still I mean as a letter I'll

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,440
just say that I mean I've seen articles

00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,330
written by especially an external

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,100
counsel we're trying to be you know get

00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:21,030
clients and kind of spreading a certain

00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:22,740
buzz for what happened so so what's

00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,270
great now is we've evolved to a point

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,230
where people who are really

00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,550
knowledgeable the community have come

00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,080
together so you know we're gonna like

00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:30,000
actually put some knowledge out there

00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,380
and then you kind of go okay this isn't

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,360
as comfortable some random person looks

00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,530
like it came from like what vetted by a

00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,930
bunch of people I know same things like

00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,100
curriculum is no change present a same

00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:41,580
thing that they've been chained and the

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,140
SPX data exchange I just want to clarify

00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,030
that acceptable people mention it really

00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,950
quickly but it's a standard format for

00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,780
communicating information about software

00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,750
communities not just about licenses it's

00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,320
like lots of info and it's actually

00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:57,210
there's there's a lot of it's like some

00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,580
language so that the point of that

00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,590
project was that people in this started

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,180
a long time ago like Oh companies are

00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,950
asking for a software build materials

00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,780
and they're asking for in different

00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,950
formats and so now you guys this is like

00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,690
a wasted effort so like let's at least

00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,820
define a format and have the same format

00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,620
and there's a lot more that goes off of

00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,240
that and there's one aspect of it as

00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,400
part of that it's called SPX license

00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,560
list which I maintain which has short

00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,420
identifiers for license this end of

00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,610
itself I call it the gateway drugs SPS

00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,440
because it sort of I never

00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,850
everybody wants the needs of referral

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,440
license is not just a mess it's

00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:31,540
documented your generators but in other

00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,580
places and we started really advocating

00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,750
those identifiers in source files so

00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,510
that it sort of it sort of like circular

00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:39,430
right developers are going about putting

00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,620
license in the code you put the license

00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:43,240
and license that text file but you don't

00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,340
have anything in the individual files

00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,140
well they don't lose travel together so

00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:51,670
we really try to advocate for you know

00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:54,040
short reliable way to identify the

00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,930
license in the code and then you can

00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:01,210
then it makes that easier to automate

00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:05,160
other processes right and as well so

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:09,850
anyway Donald's like short but anyway I

00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:13,270
am open source at Delaney calm I am also

00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:15,040
available for work these days and saying

00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:19,530
that as well as like a new work that I'm

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,530
continuing to do and I'm happy to

00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,579
[Music]

00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:36,270
