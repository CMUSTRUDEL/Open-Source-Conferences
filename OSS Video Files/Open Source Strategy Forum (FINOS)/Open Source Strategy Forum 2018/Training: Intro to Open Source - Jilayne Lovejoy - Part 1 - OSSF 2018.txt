[Music]

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:17,490
all right so hello and welcome and this

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,080
is a sort of back to back extended

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,359
training session so hopefully you're all

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,230
here for the right thing

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,970
my name is Joe Lane Lovejoy and I look I

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,920
don't usually like to do the whole like

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,449
here's my resume but just a little bit

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,890
about my background because I think it

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,710
helps frame that kind of perspective

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,690
that I have so I am a lawyer in the US

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,600
and I started out my sort of open source

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,070
legal career by kind of jumping off the

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,989
deep end when I ended up at a company

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,920
that provided services around open

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,699
source scanning and support services and

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,309
so forth and so on so I had and then

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,600
later on moved to a company that some of

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,629
the Brits in the itis might know as

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,910
armed up the road in Cambridge and so

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,010
I've had a always been in house I've had

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,590
a really fortunate perspective of seeing

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,869
how a lot of different companies manage

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,840
or don't manage open source over the

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,729
past like decade and been involved in a

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,070
lot of improvements when I was at armed

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm not there any longer and I've also

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,729
been in really deeply involved with a

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,500
couple projects that you've heard

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,180
mention depending on the sessions that

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,580
you've been in one of them's called the

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,159
software package data exchange or SPX I

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,229
have been the maintainer of the SPX

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,900
license list since its inception for a

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,000
better force and also was one of the

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,680
founding members of open chain if those

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,229
I'm going to explain a little more about

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,829
what those are sort of later so I'll

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,070
come back to that

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,720
so I've I've been very fortunate as sort

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,880
of being a lawyer but also having sort

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,530
of a community experience directly in

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,210
working the open source community it's

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,759
been something I've really enjoyed a lot

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,729
so hopefully I have some helpful info

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,320
for you today so think since we have two

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,630
sessions I don't know how I'm supposed

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,280
to do this but I mean we can have like a

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,770
little break in the middle so someone

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,450
can tell me when we're the 45 minute

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,770
mark and hopefully I've timed my slides

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,530
too

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,540
a convenient break at that point and and

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,730
then we'll carry on with the the second

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,870
session and hopefully a plenty of time

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,000
for Q&A at the end I'm not real

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,260
you know stringent on the QA thinks if

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,210
you have questions as I'm going along

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,560
just raise your hand if it's something

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,920
I'm gonna come over later I might ask

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,330
you to hold that so our trail map as I

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,340
like to say better than road map

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,720
gratuitous picture of Colorado where I

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,430
live so we're going to cover some of the

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,930
topics that are actually from the open

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,990
chain curriculum if you did how many

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,470
people saw Andrew Katz talk yesterday

00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:51,000
okay some so open chain as I mention it

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,010
is a collaborative project about

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,360
establishing sort of baseline

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,400
requirements for good open-source

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,260
management and one of the things that's

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,280
come out of that project is a current a

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,620
training curriculum the idea was that

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,690
myself and other colleagues and friends

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,250
in this industry all probably were doing

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,260
training and our various companies and

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,060
realize that our training slides

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,740
probably looked a lot the same covered a

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,140
lot of same material so wouldn't it make

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,790
a lot more sense to open-source that

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,630
material so that other people didn't

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,050
have to redo that work so the training

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,630
program that arm was a or is a member of

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,820
a chain that I had developed there got

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,230
incorporated into that curriculum so you

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,910
sort of if you go look at it open chain

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,020
II open chain training slides you might

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,390
see some familiar material which is

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,330
great right and then I've got a little

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,880
bit more of my my spin on it at the end

00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,650
and so those that we'll cover a little

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,700
bit about intellectual property law as

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,290
it relates to open source a very

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,840
high-level view I'll talk about that in

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,270
a second and I mean the goal here is

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,120
really to just give you a basic

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,350
foundation of knowledge that'll sort of

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,150
can help you start thinking about

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,570
building you know policy and processes

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,950
and so forth that your organization

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,840
intro to open source licenses and then

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,209
an overview of sort of how open source

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,230
or how organizations engage with open

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,900
source they use it and what the key

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,330
considerations are there and one of the

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,489
other themes I have is is is I always

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,140
find that terminology is always an issue

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,660
it's been interesting listening some of

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,950
the other talks actually you've seen you

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,510
know pleasantly surprised at some

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,110
consistency and how people refer to

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,360
things that's always good

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,639
but you know your starting point when

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,919
you start to develop these you know

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,879
these processes and your company is like

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,409
are we all speaking the same language

00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,610
and we say something do we mean the same

00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,900
thing and if you're a company if you

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,669
know if you're a global company that's

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,080
it you know another layer of challenging

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,919
you have people for whom English is in

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,409
their first language or you have

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,590
different languages so so making sure

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,699
you have that established and the other

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,500
thing to throw into that mix is there's

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,680
a there's certain legal terms of art

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,960
that have that use common English words

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,449
but have a specific meaning in the law

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,310
and then in a specific jurisdiction so

00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,379
it's I'm gonna try to point those out

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,960
because I can also cause some

00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,490
misunderstandings but I think the goal

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,779
is sort of just you know start out and

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,819
kind of have like the basic knowledge

00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:08,889
because the other thing I found over the

00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,409
last decade of working this space is

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,300
especially as open sources become more

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:15,430
ubiquitous is that everybody thinks they

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,930
know oh yeah yeah I know about it my

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,479
source and then there's sort of gaps in

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,409
your knowledge or blind spots and so you

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,909
know you don't know what you don't know

00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:23,319
so it's always good to kind of come back

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:27,960
to basics I know some of you in here

00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,669
this is uh this is not really new ok so

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,419
obviously as a u.s. lawyer this is

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:37,150
pretty much a US law perspective having

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,169
worked a lot in the UK I have good

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,930
reason to believe there's a lot of

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:43,330
consistency copyright law is somewhat

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,069
consistent across most jurisdictions in

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,680
terms of like the main principles but

00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,539
but like I said disclaimer it is is a US

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,979
law perspective most of the open source

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:53,740
licenses were written in the US so

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,919
that's not an entirely bad place to

00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,490
start it's not totally being a typical

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:02,199
myopic American but but they also don't

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,610
have a jurisdictional clause a lot of

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,009
times so you don't have to take that

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,990
into account this is not intended to try

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,620
to make you alert this is a really brief

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,169
30,000 foot view and so I always think

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,029
it's important though to just you know

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,289
have some again basic level of

00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,550
understanding because we start talking

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,289
about open source license we start

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,360
talking about interpretation of open

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:23,710
source licenses and we've like God will

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,509
hold on a second you know these are

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,189
copyright licenses there's copyright law

00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,860
of possibly patent law implications of

00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,270
trademark law and if you haven't you

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,529
know if you don't have sort of some

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,729
basic understanding there then you're

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,259
sort of putting the cart before the

00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,020
horse and I meant to ask so how many

00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,460
people in here are lawyers

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,659
okay how many people are developers

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,780
engineers and vision business people

00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,400
what are their roles how many people are

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,860
involved in their open source an open

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,169
source program out there all right so

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,629
we've got a whole mix so I don't know

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,969
where everyone's knowledge is but

00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:02,199
hopefully if it's a refresher be good

00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:04,840
okay so what is intellectual property I

00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,610
think this is kind of can be an

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,169
overloaded term depending on the space

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,509
the company working it can kind of refer

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,340
to different things but from a sort of a

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,169
legal perspective I think of it as an

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,020
umbrella term it's really kind of

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:20,229
talking about a collection of areas of

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,419
law which is really patents copyright

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,039
trademark and trade secret which is a

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,150
bit u.s. specific but you can think of

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,819
that as sort of confidential information

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,440
and there's a lot of confusion I've

00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,300
noticed over the boundaries of each

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,250
which isn't really helped by there being

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,800
some overlap but probably less than

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,330
you'd think the other confusion I think

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,520
that gets causes if you're a patent

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,580
attorney patent attorneys often talk

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,050
about IP and only that's sort of only

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,490
includes patents so sometimes when

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,069
people say IP they're really talking

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,650
about patents but for those of us who

00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:54,159
practice in the other areas of IP it is

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,949
an umbrella term but it's so it's good

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,479
to just sort of understand the different

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,250
you know the different justifications

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,960
for the different areas law and then the

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,400
really the main focus here and I'm going

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,990
to kind of go and honestly the order on

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,300
this slide is copyright law because

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,460
that's really what's most relevant it

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,060
comes open source and and patent law and

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,650
a little bit trademarks obviously trade

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,789
secret doesn't really apply here right

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,930
trade secrets about keeping things

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:21,039
secret we're working and open so I'm not

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,279
going to I'm not going to talk about

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,009
that in like I said there's sort of

00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:29,469
these different theories of why things

00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,960
are protected the the big one and in the

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,599
in in sort of US terms in terms it's

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,039
it's like promoting innovation promoting

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,300
the progress of science and useful arts

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,490
and that's sort of incentivizing

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,849
research and development and that sort

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,860
of where copyright and patent law come

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,880
from and then but trademark is actually

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,980
quite different so I see a lot of

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,200
confusion there

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,720
so let's talk a little bit about

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,390
trademarks so trademarks are about

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,790
protecting words low logo slogans that

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:03,320
identify the source of the product and

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:05,120
so the the goal here is actually

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,279
consumer and brand protection so it's

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,079
not it's not the same as that innovation

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,380
piece we'll talk about the patents and

00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,880
copyright and avoiding consumer

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,649
confusion so the test for infringement

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,279
is is there a likelihood of consumer

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:22,790
confusion you know if if I put a a

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:26,450
swoosh mark that looks a lot like Nike

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,790
on a pair of shoes and you're used to

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,649
the brand recognition and the quality

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,360
that associated with Nike shoes and you

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,269
buy my shoes you you're you know likely

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,029
to be confused and Nike may have a good

00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,490
lawsuit against me so it must be source

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,050
identifying and distinct in you have to

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,779
be the first to use the mark and

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,010
commerce so another another thing about

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,079
trademark law that people get confused

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,829
with is you have to enforce the mark so

00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,510
if someone is using a mark similar to

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,769
yours or misusing your mark and you

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,240
don't say anything about that can

00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,060
actually be sort of dangerous and I've

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,920
seen that people get really upset if

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,600
they get say a cease and desist letter

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,130
and sometimes get to as well you know

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,899
the trademark owner kind of needs do

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,209
that if they don't they can kind of you

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,160
know dilute or almost potentially lose

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,980
their mark or threat of that so you have

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,370
to kind of police it a little bit and

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,570
it's a trademark can be can go on for

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,670
forever there's no limit as long as

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,209
you're using it and you're you know

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,760
you're actively kind of enforcing it

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,709
then it stays in effect there's some

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,420
things about a trademark becoming

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,310
generic you might have heard it's

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,350
actually quite rare so I'm not gonna go

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,959
into the details of that and trademarks

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,699
can be registered or unregistered I

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,490
think there's different regimes on that

00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:42,230
but in like in the US you'll see TM and

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,990
that means it's unregistered it might be

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,550
pending registration or not and our

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,870
means it's been registered and there's

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,459
and like a lot of things a lot of

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,470
there's sort of some benefits to having

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,940
it registered

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,920
especially if if you have an

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,569
infringement suit later but that doesn't

00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,130
mean it's not protected if it's not it

00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,649
doesn't have to be registered to be

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,390
protected

00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,980
so the key thing there like I said is

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,839
that consumer protection and sort of

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,610
brand identification and trademarks can

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,630
be really really valuable and important

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,190
and open-source and actually I think

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:15,820
that will see them becoming more

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:18,399
important over time so let's see all

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,670
right let's talk a little bit about

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,830
patents so patents protect useful

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,510
innovations or inventions or ideas right

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,790
and so some of the requirements to get a

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,560
patent has to be new it has to be

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,270
something you know novel as compared to

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,709
sort of what's already out there in the

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,790
world so you know a patent something

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,459
that's already there you hear about

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,440
people time up prior art searches it has

00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,480
to be invented so it has to be something

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,100
that's not obvious to someone having the

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,920
ordinary skill in the arts it you know

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,930
actually be something you know new and

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,700
cool and not just sort of an obvious

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,680
next step

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,149
it's got to be useful um

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,430
house to have its you know it's this is

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,320
not about art that's more of a realm of

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,209
our creativity they're more of the realm

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,760
of copyright and it has to be a

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:03,100
patentable subject matter now I'm I'm

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,220
not going to get into that debate

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,570
there's a huge to be on software there

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,860
some people especially in the free

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,390
software community that I think saw

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,230
software should never have been

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,209
patentable there has a interesting sort

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,450
of history in the u.s. of software

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:22,180
patents becoming more common and then

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,770
more recently some case law that people

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,140
and people see is sort of chipping away

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,730
a little bit at that and but you know

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,470
patent attorneys will really argue on

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,100
what that all means of course because

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,779
it's all case law so and then it's also

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,980
you know what what is software what is a

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,990
software patent to begin with I mean how

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,510
do you draw that distinction so that's a

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,990
you know that's a very ripe topic I

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,209
think the the relevant thing I've seen

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,350
in terms of developers is sometimes

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:51,250
they're like oh well software isn't

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:54,579
patentable and so we're okay and you

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,560
know that's certainly probably not a

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,880
misunderstanding you want perpetuated in

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,230
your organization especially if you're

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,700
interested in filing patents and so then

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,680
there's also it must be disclosed

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,190
somehow I did not put that on there and

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,570
that's sort of a quid pro quo for the

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,089
patent process right we don't really

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,120
like

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,040
Napoles but a patent is basically a

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,730
20-year monopoly you have the exclusive

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,009
right to practice that invention and and

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,050
your sort of bargain for that is that

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,449
you've disclosed in your patent

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,550
application how to do it and how to make

00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:32,050
in and and so forth and so on so that's

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,220
that's sort of how that bargain is

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,040
played out so and then the rights are

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,540
assignable meaning you can transfer

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,220
ownership of the rights so what do you

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,410
get so you don't actually get anything

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,910
when you when you get a patent but it's

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,439
sort of like a negative right you get

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,850
the right to stop other peoples from

00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,470
doing things that are sort of your

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,420
exclusive rights so it's just like I

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,040
said a limited term monopoly in return

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,399
for making that invention available to

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,930
public and and the ability to you know

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,699
stop other people from doing things or

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,230
charges have them you know pay money for

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:05,019
that obviously via a licensing I'll talk

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:07,910
more about licensing later obviously and

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,540
yeah and so then the key the key actions

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,829
are make you sell offer for sale and an

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,809
invention and then there's also the

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,490
claims of the patent so when you have

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,499
arguments over infringement you get down

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,819
to like well what was the actual you

00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:21,970
know different parts of the patent and

00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:25,730
what did they and potentially infringe

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,879
so copyright protects original works of

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,800
authorship and it needs to be creative

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,059
although the threshold for creativity is

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,410
quite low there's some really

00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:36,529
interesting case law in the US about

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,379
that the protection attaches as soon as

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,759
the work is created so it you don't have

00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,850
to have a copyright notice now there's

00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,980
good reasons to have a copyright notice

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,769
but that's not what tells you that the

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,809
works protected covers literary dramatic

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:53,629
court you know all all kinds of sort of

00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,980
creative works and and in software is

00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:59,569
protected actually under the literary

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:02,689
work piece if you will the copyright

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:05,689
owner is the author whoever wrote it if

00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,519
it's you're employed then there's

00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:11,660
something called work for hire in the US

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,230
that's means that it's um it's the the

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,959
employer is the author

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,790
now that was mentioned this morning in

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,290
the keynote there's there's also the

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,879
fact that you probably haven't you know

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,470
it's not coat so it's so cut and drive

00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,390
its right so what if you're a contractor

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,370
and there's a lot of cases on that a lot

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,380
of times you'll have an agreement that

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,030
sets those rights out very clearly

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,410
probably it says you know as a

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,090
contractor we're going to treat anything

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,330
you create like as if it's a work for

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,890
hire or something along those lines it's

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,480
better to have that clarity written down

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,490
in your employment or a contractor

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,930
agreement because that's why you end up

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,340
with really interesting case laws when

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,670
it wasn't written down and everybody

00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,770
thought something different and you know

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:56,030
employment law varies from country to

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:58,220
country so how far your employer can go

00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,750
in terms of what they own and we talked

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,310
a little bit there's some talk this

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,310
morning about you know sort of own time

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,410
versus work time it is a bit fuzzy and

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,670
it can vary in different countries so I

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,270
mean I can't really give you like a

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,070
blanket rule but if you're an employer

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,170
employee obviously you want to you know

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,210
read your employment agreement be clear

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,740
on what it says and ask questions about

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,180
it to be make sure everybody's sort of

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,770
on the same page I mean a lot of times

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,280
these things are you know expectations

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,800
are key right so what do you get with

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,220
copyright you get the exclusive right to

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,470
do and authorize any of the numa

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,940
numerated rights one of the analogies

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,410
that's often used is it's like a bundle

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,270
of sticks you have these sort of bundle

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,010
of sticks or these rights and you can

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,240
give them away but they're they're yours

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,700
so this little similar to patents in

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,510
that way so the key the key rights in

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,100
terms of software is copy or reproduce

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:53,320
prepare derivative works and and

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,320
distribute copies so our redistributable

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,750
derivative works is a legal term of art

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:04,220
in the u.s. and and so it's it has some

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,380
similar analogies in you or UK law but

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,459
it's a it's it is a legal term art so

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,390
this is one of the great example when

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,819
those things are saying where it's you

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,530
know it's just a derivative is a normal

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:17,959
English word but has a very specific

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:20,780
meaning well it has a very specific

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,939
meaning and yet it's mostly defined by

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,819
case law so I'll talk a little bit more

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:28,459
about why that causes engineers in

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:32,260
particular you know hair carrying out

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,400
feelings because it's it's a bit smushy

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,260
but anyway it's important important to

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,160
kind of understand that that does have

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,010
sort of a li

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:46,160
a specific legal meaning that's mostly

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:53,840
defined by case law um so let's see what

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:55,640
else did I want to say here so and and

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,950
the rights are obviously assignable as

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,430
well a sign a bowl is a full transfer of

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,230
race so I have a few things here on sort

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,450
of what copyright doesn't cover because

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,940
there's this sort of it's easier to just

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,520
say anything you create covered by

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,470
copyright as soon as you you know it's

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,000
fixed in a you know as you write it down

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,210
or you it's fixed in a tangible medium

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,060
gonna be the technical term but

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,890
copyright first of all it covers the

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,020
expression not the idea so this is the

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,300
other area of confusion I see ideas are

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,450
the realm of patent law and an

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:33,890
expression is the realm of copyright so

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:37,040
the one way to think about this or the

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,810
classic law school exam is like if two

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,550
programmers go you know are given a task

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,020
in two different parts of the world

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,510
they've never met there's like you know

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,330
no contact between them and they at the

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,680
same time write the same code because

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,260
they you know answering this this

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,970
question they both have copyright

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,110
there's no infringement for that whereas

00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:03,290
in patents I would be quite different so

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:06,470
that's a challenging thing so like the

00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:08,870
the other you know describing a method

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,940
is not that's like the famous case law

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,450
in the u.s. is not copyrightable it's

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,640
the expression of how about in the book

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,750
in this case in that case now related

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,300
that there's this concept called the

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,430
merger doctrine where if the underlying

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,530
idea can only be expressed in one way

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,810
that the idea in the expression merge is

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,940
and you can't have copyright over that

00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:32,540
because you have like a monopoly over an

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,340
idea so there's also a concept called de

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:39,380
minimis which meaning like the copying

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:41,000
is so minut or trivial that it doesn't

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,560
rise the level of copyright law you got

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,790
to be careful on that the case law you

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,970
see around that is usually music

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,680
sampling and there's I think was one

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,110
case where you know three notes was not

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,270
de minimis because it was like

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,950
riff of the song and super recognizable

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,540
so you know it's not a clear can be

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,880
again I think sometimes developers like

00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,380
well there's only two lines like well if

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,160
that was like the most important

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:06,670
functionality of the whole code you know

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:09,130
maybe it may be not fair use obviously

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:13,630
has gotten a lot more attention recently

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:15,730
thanks to Oracle and Google um it's

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,360
called fair do dealing in the UK it's a

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,880
similar concept it's permitted used to

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,370
sort of a defense to and infringement

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,320
case for for limited reasons that are

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,610
sort of considered you know a kind of

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,380
lie most like a public good kind of

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,710
thing right you know criticism parody

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,570
news reporting teaching library and in

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,330
what's interesting is in the UK it's

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,799
it's very specifically spelled out so

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,020
there's sort of these clear categories

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,750
and in the US there's sort of this like

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,780
hinting out of examples but really again

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:51,160
it's just like for our several part test

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,900
that the judges apply not only so easily

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,700
to find the patterns there but that the

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,510
thing to remember is I've heard people

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,250
say oh no as I'm my it's fair use and

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,540
and my con and again it's another one of

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,070
those like legal term of arts and you

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,870
know my response I was like well you may

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,600
think it's fair for you to use it but

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,830
that doesn't mean it's fair use and you

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
know usually don't want to you're

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,240
fighting that battle you're you're in

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,919
court public domain which I'll talk

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,860
about again later is works that are

00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,419
where copyright has expired or it's

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,910
otherwise for some reason not protected

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,740
but that's another thing I've heard

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:29,110
people say oh it's in the public domain

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:31,929
and and that has again a very specific

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,910
legal meaning it's pretty consistent

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:36,130
across the jurisdictions I've looked at

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,049
but it's you know it again is sort of a

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,940
you could sort of say that in casual

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,850
talk right and understand it means you

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,740
just again be careful of kind of open

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,929
sources is not in public domain is not

00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:51,190
the same thing okay so licenses

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:53,679
basically licenses are what gives you

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,490
permission right this is the the like I

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,380
have all these rights and but I can say

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,470
Matthew you can do this because I've

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,850
given you a license and

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,679
and and that's to you know basically

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,530
exercise a right that otherwise would be

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,230
reserved for the for the owner of the IP

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:11,940
and whichever case so you know typical

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,590
kinds of use allowed is gonna usually

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,650
track on sort of the statutory language

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:19,230
sometimes you can use more more sort of

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,210
regular language and depending on how

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,559
you sort of our drafting your your

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,240
license and then you can place

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,059
conditions on that so you can say you

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,270
know I give you the right to copy the

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:33,480
software provided that you you know

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,950
provide a copy of license they might be

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,840
an exclusive license it might be

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,350
non-exclusive there may be geographical

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,630
limits

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,880
it may be perpetual or for only a period

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,350
of time and then it may also include

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,120
more contractual type terms like

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,669
warranties or identification or you know

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,309
a software you may have support terms

00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:52,169
and upgrade and maintenance and so forth

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,059
and just sort of on that note so open

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,650
source licenses are copyright licenses

00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:00,000
sort of at their core as it's like a

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,980
starting point they may include and some

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,870
taught an explicit patent grant they may

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,100
include other terms about patents but in

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,980
terms of just talking about like the

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,990
grants them permissions and they may

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,549
include an implied patent grant if you

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:18,450
heard the talk yesterday there's some

00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:20,520
some debate over this apparently now so

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,169
let me just explain what it means I was

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,500
gonna talk about this later a bit so

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:28,110
some licenses just explicitly say you

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,510
know a patent license grant - you know

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,039
it's a very very clear Apache 2.0 is be

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,110
the most obvious one and there's an

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,659
interesting sort of history if you look

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,909
at the chronology of when open-source

00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,340
licenses were written of when those

00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:43,620
grants started showing up and in you

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,360
know there's no like cause correlation

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,480
you know you could argue but III think

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,950
there is a sort of a correlation in any

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,900
way in terms of like the rise of

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,490
software patents and then and also and

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,750
more bigger companies getting involved

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,080
in open-source and then seeing those

00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,000
those terms start to pop up and licenses

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,809
you know so you can make some

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,690
conclusions on maybe why that might have

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,850
been there then but not beforehand some

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,419
licenses don't explicitly mention

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:14,550
patents and so there's always this sort

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,650
of question well what does that mean

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,440
and I think it's important to think

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,710
about why do you need to answer that

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,030
right so because it's you know it's kind

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,970
of a specific scenario if I'm

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,070
contributing to a project and I have

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,420
patents that read on you know I'm

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,220
definitely giving a copyright license

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,940
and I have patents that read also read

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,350
on that same software then what the

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,200
open-source community doesn't want to

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,910
happen is for me to then be able to sort

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,780
of Trojan horse the software right so if

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,160
I don't like oh I'll give you a

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,350
copyright license but now you have to

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,540
pay me for the patent license and that's

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,070
no no he's obvious you know to know if

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,600
there's patents covering something and

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,940
so that's another you know that's really

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,040
I like that the why you see patent

00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:01,140
grants in open source licenses was to

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:04,500
sort of protect the community so if

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,210
you're contributing and you've got a

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,680
license that maybe some people say there

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,100
isn't a patent grant or you could read a

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,440
patent ran in I think a pragmatic view

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,420
and I and I know for a fact that a lot

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,020
of having worked in house and talked a

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,670
lot in House Counsel I mean you got a

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,620
look at your risk scenario right so do

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,120
you want to roll the dice and say well

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,980
actually I've got patents that covers

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,440
its software that maybe I find quite

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,580
valuable to my company well you know I

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,320
don't think there's a patent grant there

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,990
so you know we'll throw that out there

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,630
and then find yourself sort of having

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,560
that argument later depends on your risk

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:43,080
profile you know or you could say you

00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,030
know it's very it's possible that a

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,490
court could find implied patent license

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,140
here and I'm gonna you know maybe I

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,580
shouldn't be sort of putting stuff in

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,630
the open that I want to protect I mean

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,730
this this you know this sort of ALP

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:57,270
starts to cut to your IP strategy right

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,460
and and I think you think sort of

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,790
knowing what it is that's important to

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,010
you and and what your company needs to

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:08,630
protect and sort of be open about the

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:14,130
rest ideally is really really important

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:16,260
so yeah I mean that that's sort of my

00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,520
key takeaway I'm pretty pragmatic about

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,620
these things I think you need to be

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,500
pretty pragmatic in terms of your risk

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,960
profile on the company but but there are

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,580
there is there is more case law than

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,710
Adamo was discussed yesterday about

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,910
implied patent grants

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:34,610
I've looked at it it's the classic judge

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,740
makes a call on a case by case fact

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:41,540
scenario there are new cases involved

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:43,220
open source licenses there are no cases

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,190
that I know of that have been brought

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,930
you know in that realm whether or not

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,970
they made it to judicial opinions so it

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,170
is it is a bit of a you know you have to

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,700
you have to have your lawyers make a

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:57,320
call but I find as a matter of equity it

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,520
hard to believe that you would be able

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,160
to grant a copyright license to

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,200
something and and then like reserve the

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,330
other rates when you can't exercise a

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,640
copyright without the without the patent

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,850
license as well so anyway that's my view

00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,190
on that so and then also open source

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,650
licenses may also contain clauses about

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,870
trademark names usually saying you know

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,910
you can't use my name and those clauses

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,860
a lot of times aren't they're not really

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,210
I mean it says restricting which sort of

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,500
sounds like not very open source a lot

00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,300
of times they're kind of restating what

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,640
the law already is right I mean it goes

00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,430
back to that source identifying so you

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,560
know for example if you know you take

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,150
the code and you modify it which the

00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,500
copyright license allows you to do then

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,440
you know that you dip you can't

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,480
necessarily use the trademark because

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,700
now that it's something different and

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,770
you know that source identifier for

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,190
whatever the code was originally is

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,560
important to retain that identification

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,060
and so sometimes with license just say

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,070
you know if you make a derivative work

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,300
or modify this you can't call you gotta

00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,580
call it something else right which is

00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,200
pretty much what trademark law would

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,840
sort of say even if you say sometimes

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,420
you have clauses in legal agreements

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,420
that are could could almost not be there

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:11,060
I call them FYI clauses or you know hey

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,680
remember this what the law says and then

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,620
you have conditions like I said placed

00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,700
upon those enumerated rights and open

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,620
source licenses are gen

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,470
non-exclusive and perpetual they're

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,300
pretty open okay so I'm gonna pause

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:28,820
there I don't even know how are we doing

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:32,690
on time are we did we start we're about

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,550
halfway through okay call it that so I'm

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,320
gonna pause there before I go any

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,320
questions comments yes

00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,100
so the dates are supposed to reflect

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:56,450
when the work was created or modified

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,450
you know when new bits were added and so

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,010
it's a paint update that's quite frankly

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,810
right because I mean software that's

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,700
being iterated all the time you probably

00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,260
can get like yeah it's been you know

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,060
there's been enough new stuff added that

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,360
you know rise the level of copyright and

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,430
so we can just put the range and 2018

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,420
comma 2019 coming you know whatever but

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:20,420
that's yeah that's what it's a looming -

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,420
yep

00:29:49,340 --> 00:30:00,000
okay so can we get any no all right so I

00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,370
don't know I threw these slides in here

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,020
and I'm kind of I think I can skip them

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,980
is everybody know the difference between

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:10,080
object code or binary and source code

00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,549
yeah okay good I realized last night

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,830
that that's another one that was like

00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:17,220
you know assumptions you just kind of

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,630
make and you know if like if I'm

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,890
presenting the lawyers sometimes let

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,169
remember to kind of go back to that I

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,340
had a really great conversation one time

00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:26,340
with a lawyer and we were going back and

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,890
forth I own a negotiating a contract or

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,630
whatever and they had these ridiculous

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,539
terms they wanted with open source and

00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,100
and it was wasn't like making sense to

00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,100
me and my co-workers were listening and

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,360
I and then I I finally said because I

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,950
always like to see them the bastards

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,380
assume people know more than I do and

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,580
whatever and I said well do you know

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,760
what the difference between source and

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,830
binary about no and I just

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,990
thought wow man I just wasted a lot of

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,330
my time it's been about Stan that like

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,940
she's know an hour ago anyway all right

00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,100
so good I'm gonna skip these awesome all

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,510
right so a note on terminology you'll

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,100
hear you've probably heard throughout

00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,260
the couple days people say open-source

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,809
software people say free software people

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,100
say free and open-source software might

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,330
not have heard people actually say free

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,190
Libre and open source software cuz

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,890
that's kind of a mouthful you see the

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,210
abbreviations OSS don't use OS because

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,130
that's usually operating systems like

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,470
it's really confusing if it wasn't

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,650
already Foss and sometimes floss the L

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,480
being Libre and you might be thinking

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:28,740
what the heck is this all mean

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,440
and so there are some philosophical

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,659
reasons for these different terms but

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,280
pragmatically it's the same thing okay

00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:40,730
it's open its software under an

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:43,650
open-source license free software is is

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,730
the term a little more like I think

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,230
there's a more like sort of passion

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:49,169
behind that in terms of free as in

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:52,500
freedom obviously free in English also

00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:56,970
means no cost so that caused confusion

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,049
open-source software came about with the

00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,220
idea that that was sort of more

00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,510
business-friendly because

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,450
businesses were afraid of this crazy

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:05,250
free software movement I mean you

00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,290
there's there's interesting articles on

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,570
the philosophy and people's preference

00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,770
of these different terms like I said if

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,720
you're pretty you know from a pragmatic

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:16,470
perspective we're talking about the same

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,170
stuff but you know I'd try to sometimes

00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,360
if you switch which term I use depending

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,770
on who or what I'm talking about because

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,300
you know it's kind of like saying lift

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,830
or elevator depending on your fear in

00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,020
the US UK just sort of out of respect

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,060
but any case if that's you know don't be

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,580
confused by that but it isn't it is an

00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,260
interesting topic but so here's a

00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,180
question always like to ask so what is

00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:40,500
open-source software is it a development

00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:43,400
model ideology legal construct what do

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,400
you guys think what are your impressions

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:54,750
not allowed to answer so right it's all

00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,410
three well I mean you know I knew you're

00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,690
gonna say so what do i what do I mean by

00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,370
that so development model is all about

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,080
if you have access to the source code

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,270
that means anyone can tinker with it

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,800
right they modify it improve it and then

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,450
you benefit from that collective

00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,830
intelligence of many developers so that

00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,450
is a development model and that's

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,660
actually a development model that

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,250
companies are realizing is so great that

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,140
they're sort of dude creating that even

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,940
in inner I think someone's time about

00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,830
inner source within their companies

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,260
right like trying to instead of having

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,000
just really segmented teams working as

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,320
stuff being more open just within the

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,170
confines of the company for say their

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,340
proprietary code and ideology I kind of

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,900
mentioned that you know belief and

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,520
freedom and sort of a desire to share

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,930
belief that the source code should be

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,050
free so I think there is this

00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:42,300
underpinning ideology I don't really

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,920
care if you agree with that or not but

00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,750
you have to understand that and

00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,520
appreciate it I think if you're working

00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,240
in this space that's something I

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,950
definitely say to lawyers and then legal

00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,540
construct right the collaborative model

00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,550
and that ideology is sort of implemented

00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,230
via the license right because that's

00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,270
what gives you the rights to that says

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,350
you have you know to do the things that

00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,950
you want to be able to do with the

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,540
source code and so forth and so on so

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,070
the open source license gives you

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,399
permission to use a program for any

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,289
person purpose modify it which is a

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,789
a create derivative works and I think

00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:16,919
modifies a little more accessible Word

00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:18,899
and then redistribute the program to

00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:21,690
others either your original version or

00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:23,490
the modified version so this is a very

00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,649
shorthand definition of what an

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,789
open-source license is if it doesn't do

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:29,940
one of those things and it's not open

00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:31,770
source open source may or may not also

00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,569
be no cost so this is what comes backs

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,730
or that sort of language definition

00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:40,500
versus you know free where you have like

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:42,869
Libre versus gratis and other sort of a

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,369
helpful distinction but but because a

00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,109
lot of them source software is actually

00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:49,559
no cost and I think that that gets a bit

00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:51,089
can be cause confusion and then sort of

00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,770
added this recently just because you

00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,940
have the source code doesn't mean it's

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:59,099
open source so I'm starting to see some

00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,900
licenses pop up that are like well we

00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,279
kind of want to be open source ish we

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,750
want to give you the source code but

00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:06,930
then put a bunch of restrictions on it

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,210
that's not open source it's really again

00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,700
about like I said in the beginning you

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,770
know having terms and understandings

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,569
that we all can rely on and we've taken

00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,539
a long time to get here is really

00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:20,760
important you know lawyers in contracts

00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:23,099
fight about definitions a lot right that

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,319
can be litigation can be all about that

00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:27,150
and I I would really like to not have to

00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:28,859
have that argument luckily I want to do

00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,539
that kind of stuff so freezing freedom

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:33,809
not freezing beer the famous quote by

00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:36,240
Richard Stallman which I just love and

00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:39,000
so in terms of defining open source

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,109
there's a couple key kind of definition

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,180
so how many people heard of Free

00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:49,890
Software Foundation how many people

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:51,180
heard of Richard Stallman no and so so

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,710
Richard Stallman is considered the

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,760
father of free software again I'm using

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,770
the term free software very

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,559
intentionally founded the Free Software

00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:01,440
Foundation in 85 launched the new

00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,150
project canoe is recursive canoe not

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,920
Linux the operating a free operating

00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,710
system and and the mission there is

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,020
really about freedom of source code and

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:13,680
and free software freedom and computer

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,890
freedom and there's a lot of you know

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,180
really interesting theories there I mean

00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,660
you know it againi whether you agree

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,910
with it or not

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,279
it's it's certainly worth kind of

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,510
understanding that perspective and then

00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,200
the open source initiative was created

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,620
in

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,670
this is a little bit you know open

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,150
source is starting to become more

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,750
popular and more used and and so the

00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,040
open source initiative begins to kind of

00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,170
be a little bit more of a bridge because

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:45,000
some people found that the hardcore sort

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:46,680
of freedom approach you know a little

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,540
hard for companies to kind of understand

00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,340
you know again no opinion on that and

00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,050
and the big thing that Open Source

00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,030
Initiative has which you've also heard a

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,650
lot about is open source definition now

00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,210
I didn't reproduce these things on here

00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,950
that oh sorry I meant to say the Free

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,480
Software Foundation has the four have

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,720
four freedoms I find the four freedoms

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,000
takes a lot less time to read instead of

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,800
ten definition things but you should

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,270
look at both of these I mean they're not

00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,340
they're not inconsistent it's just a

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:14,360
different way of expressing essentially

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,550
the concepts I put on the slide prior

00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,590
the the big thing the open source

00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:22,230
initiative does is it approves licenses

00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,240
that are submitted to it on whether or

00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:27,270
not they meet the definition so you hear

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,950
about OSI approved licenses now let me

00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:34,290
clarify something I heard earlier today

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:36,570
not all open source licenses are OSI

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,030
approved they may still meet the open

00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,160
source definition maybe that license

00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,780
wasn't submitted which is most likely

00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,520
the case there are lots of open source

00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,950
licenses out there lots of them are sort

00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,910
of slight variations on existing ones

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:52,050
and they are just as much open source as

00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,520
one that's approved by the open source

00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:58,470
initiative so I've seen people use

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,200
definitions in to legal contracts saying

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,820
it's open source license if it's OSI

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,460
approved I think that's extremely

00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,440
dangerous because you've just like made

00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,790
a distinction that's not valuable in

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,800
terms of probably what you're trying to

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:16,260
affect I've also seen people define open

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,970
source as only certain types of licenses

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,980
I think that's also dangerous like just

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:25,110
stick with the general definitions we

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:27,630
have please but yeah so the you know so

00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,000
just remember the OSI the OSI approved

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,800
license is a subset it's a it's a short

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,590
list like I said not everybody submits

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,440
their license to be approved it's it's

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,460
good to use those licenses because there

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,839
tend to be the ones that are more

00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,369
popular more than well-known there are

00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:44,859
some on that list that are really old

00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:47,079
and are not used so even of that list of

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,579
that our OSI proved there's like almost

00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,859
like a subset of that or like the really

00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:52,770
known popular or used ones and then

00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:55,569
there's some that have you know kind of

00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,890
not and they're actually some of those

00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:58,810
have been deprecated because they've had

00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,700
new versions yes so anyway so so you

00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:04,240
know good to be familiar with that and

00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:06,339
sort of understand that distinction okay

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,990
I kind of talked about this before but I

00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:10,329
was think it's kind of helpful if you're

00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:13,329
someone especially as work you know kind

00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:15,970
of used to commercial licenses or close

00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:17,859
source licenses if you will to kind of

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,359
think about open source licenses or

00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,829
licenses this is another thing I think

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,819
people let's open source it's free I can

00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:22,869
do it over I want like well I know

00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,849
there's still a license you got to think

00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:26,380
about you know how what that says and so

00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:27,849
forth and so on so so if you kind of

00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,869
think of it side to side and open source

00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,599
licenses they're just a unilateral

00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:33,520
permission right there's not negotiated

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,230
it's they're taking it taking it you

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,060
know take it as it is and anyone can use

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,819
a code there's no affirmative acceptance

00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,619
needed it's a direct license from the

00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:43,030
license or to each person who picks it

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,630
up that's actually pretty important

00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,329
concept

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,430
whereas proprietary licenses you know

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,170
they tend to be negotiated terms they

00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,270
can be quite specific to the parties you

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,680
know you may have a product and every

00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,819
customer you have special if you're a

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,349
small company and you're dealing with

00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,880
big companies wants to negotiate and

00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:59,140
ever you want of your license is a

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,160
slightly different cuz they want their

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,359
term you know they want to get their

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,310
little mark on it right lawyers some

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,140
lawyers really like to leave their mark

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,760
on an agreement even if they didn't

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,839
really need to and sort of the grant of

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,460
rights right we already talked about

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,560
that you can copy modify and distribute

00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,069
it's a wide grant of rights right this

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,240
is like where copyright are the free

00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,040
software movement like I'm we're going

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,410
to take the copyright law sort of regime

00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,660
which is sort of more default closed

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,430
right when when a work is created you

00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,050
don't have a license and until someone

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,490
gives you a license and we're gonna use

00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,079
it to grant back these big rights

00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,460
whereas you know proprietary licenses

00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,079
usually have restrictions you know maybe

00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,940
you can only have so many copies maybe

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,650
you cannot modify you can only use it

00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,240
for specific use cases you can't

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,520
distribute it you know we'll have you

00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,950
and then as far as license or

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,770
obligations open source software is as

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,980
is take it as you find it there's no

00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:49,450
warranty there's no support there's no

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,930
you know sort of guarantees around that

00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,369
but

00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,230
you know and in the commercial world

00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:54,309
that's something that sometimes that's

00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,079
the most valuable thing you're paying

00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:57,010
for right you maybe buy something and

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,450
what you're getting you know what you're

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,069
really paying for is like the warranties

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,910
around is for maybe IP it and

00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:08,500
identification and so on okay so what is

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:11,890
not open source software so freeware so

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,920
free where is like free as in cost but

00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,510
usually no access to the source code may

00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,160
have a bunch of restrictions usually

00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,809
doesn't allow a reverse engineering for

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,170
example a lot of times they're like

00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:26,710
specific to that to that software I mean

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,510
probably every app on your on your phone

00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,280
it probably has some kind of freeware

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,520
license I'd describe you I mean the ones

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,809
you know you didn't pay for free this

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,910
isn't you know and this is one of those

00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:39,369
terms where people kind of use it a

00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,990
little bit loose and fast so I'm kind of

00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:43,480
putting some you know some some a

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,740
definition around it shareware is sort

00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,300
of like the same thing as freeware but

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,770
you know it's could be demo where trial

00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,119
where you might hear like it's free for

00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:53,020
a certain time then you got a you know

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,250
pay up or a certain number of uses or

00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,609
whatever

00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:00,190
I mentioned public domain before so that

00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:02,890
is something has is not copyright

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,119
protected mostly because it's you know

00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:08,250
the most common thing is because it's

00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:12,250
expired now people have attempted to

00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,930
create a dedication

00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,250
see I'm not saying the word license it's

00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:19,420
really hard to not say a license was not

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:20,920
a license because it was and but you'll

00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,150
still help people say public domain

00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,740
license because it's just easier to say

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,589
license but you know it's basically like

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,760
saying I've like disclaim all copyright

00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:29,230
and I'm pushing this out in the public

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,270
domain and that's never actually been

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,710
tested in court and there's some

00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:38,079
challenges around that jurisdictionally

00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:39,700
and and so a lot of times those those

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,170
those agreements are drafted with like a

00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,000
fallback license it's sort of like if

00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,859
this doesn't work then you just get a

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,540
really broad license I've also seen

00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:48,849
public domain dedications where then

00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,790
they put a condition on it now it's a

00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:53,770
license so it's it's sort of a kind of

00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,390
can be a bit fuzzy I think that this

00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,549
sort of the takeaway is that public

00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,880
domain could be open source I mean you

00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:01,500
do see things that are released under

00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,180
or you know it under these sort of

00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,190
dedications and the source codes

00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,290
provided but but open source not is not

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:13,440
public domain does that make sense and

00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:15,270
oh yeah that works okay yeah and so I

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,560
think what you know again because the

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,570
some of these things are free is a

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,670
no-cost sometimes they get mistaken for

00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:22,290
free software open source software and

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,460
so that's one of those really you know

00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,050
important distinctions because if you

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,760
think of this from an intern you know in

00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,220
again coming from the kind of in your

00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,440
company from a procurement or

00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,970
development perspective if you know if

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,010
you don't have some clarity on these

00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,210
differences or at least you know and not

00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,680
to say that your developers should have

00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,940
to read the licenses and be like this is

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,380
a freeware license or this is you know

00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,970
sometimes you got to read it really

00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,200
closely to figure it out but but you

00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,640
need to have that awareness right for

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,470
obvious reasons you might have different

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,000
processes for something that's like

00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,800
shareware that you need it eventually

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,100
pay for then something that's open

00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:57,300
source okay

00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:58,770
so types of open source licenses there's

00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,020
generally considered sort of two types

00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:02,730
that people like to talk about

00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,720
permissive copyright permissive open

00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:06,540
source license are generally those that

00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,010
get a broad grant of rights I mean which

00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,630
all open source licenses do and then

00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,740
they have sort of minimal requirements

00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,480
right so the minimal like you've

00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,460
retained notices or provide a copy of

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,600
the license notice of modifications

00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,700
things that are almost like

00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,650
administrative if you will in terms of

00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,150
compliance and then there's copyleft and

00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,340
that usually means that the source code

00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,840
must be made available if you have a

00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,730
binary distribution obviously if you're

00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,160
distributing and source you or you have

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:34,410
a source available and then that any

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,970
modifications must remain under the same

00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,610
license now there's sort of some very

00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:41,010
varying nuances of that in terms of sort

00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,690
of strong copyleft is kind of extending

00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,340
to the whole work versus weak copyleft

00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,930
which is the other terms that are

00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,810
actually more helpful it's file level

00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,990
reciprocal license or project level

00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:54,710
reciprocal license now the other terms

00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:58,290
you hear are sometimes viral

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,340
contaminating don't use these terms

00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,070
please

00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,320
they're pejorative and you know a virus

00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,460
is something you catch and I don't know

00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,350
you should know what's in your software

00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,550
it's not a disease hereditary

00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,880
self-perpetuating reciprocal I think

00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,680
those are better words

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,610
get your head around what copyleft

00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,590
generally means as a concept and you

00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,600
know when you're if you're choosing a

00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,920
license in terms of stuff you're putting

00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,030
out I mean I'll talk more about this

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,170
again later you know you're really going

00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,550
to think about like what's your goals

00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,840
right because what the license you

00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,160
choose is going to be going to be

00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,430
specific to soar what the goals are to

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,280
that project so just some examples of

00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:40,030
each of these okay

00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,680
so MIT bsd to claus bsd 3 claws apache

00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,180
1.1 you don't see that as much anymore

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,190
but that's sort of the older version

00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,200
from apache and then copyleft these are

00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,870
sort of in order of sort of strength of

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,660
copyleft mozilla and eclipse being sort

00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:55,030
of file level reciprocal licenses and

00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,290
lesser general public license being a

00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,390
lesser version the general public

00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:03,220
license hence the name and then a Ferro

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:06,010
being being a bit stronger I'm gonna

00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:10,110
come back to that later but so these

00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:12,580
categories are really helpful however

00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:15,610
you still need to read the license so I

00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,110
think the the you know categories are is

00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,430
helpful for sort of short cutting things

00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,600
but again you gotta be careful on those

00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,610
shortcuts because sometimes you just

00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,870
sort of go too far down that road and

00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,010
then you sort of forget to come back and

00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,470
go what will holds like what does that

00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,450
license actually you know really say so

00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,920
you still need to read the license and

00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:33,090
you know and sometimes there's licenses

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,470
that look a lot like another license and

00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,690
but there's some difference in there and

00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,400
that can sometimes be hard to catch and

00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:41,440
that's where the light license scanning

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,760
tools like fossil adji that Michael

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,170
talked about yesterday are really

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,610
helpful because that you know a lot

00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,400
faster a lot a tool kind of do that

00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,750
matching for you then have a word

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,830
document in front of your like like

00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,220
lawyers do

00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:55,280
