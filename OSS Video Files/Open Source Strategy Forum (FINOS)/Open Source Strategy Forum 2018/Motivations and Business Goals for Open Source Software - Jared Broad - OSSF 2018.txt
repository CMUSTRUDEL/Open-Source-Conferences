Presentation: Motivations and Business Goals for Open Source Software

Many firms first look to open source to lower the costs of their non-competitive technology, like back-office systems. This talk will show how open-sourcing software that is critical to an organizationâ€™s competitive edge can create value by exploiting the network effects of collaborative development. Jared Broad, CEO of QuantConnect, will explore why his company open-sourced LEAN, its radically open source algorithmic trading platform, and how QuantConnect has attracted over 60,000 engineers with its professional-grade backtesting and live-trading system used by banks and funds globally.
