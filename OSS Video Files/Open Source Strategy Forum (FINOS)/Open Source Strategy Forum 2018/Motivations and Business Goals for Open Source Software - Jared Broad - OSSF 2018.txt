Title: Motivations and Business Goals for Open Source Software - Jared Broad - OSSF 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Strategy Forum 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Jared Broad, QuantConnect
Presentation: Motivations and Business Goals for Open Source Software

Many firms first look to open source to lower the costs of their non-competitive technology, like back-office systems. This talk will show how open-sourcing software that is critical to an organizationâ€™s competitive edge can create value by exploiting the network effects of collaborative development. Jared Broad, CEO of QuantConnect, will explore why his company open-sourced LEAN, its radically open source algorithmic trading platform, and how QuantConnect has attracted over 60,000 engineers with its professional-grade backtesting and live-trading system used by banks and funds globally.

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,570
and sort of marrying that with open

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,550
sources is a heart challenge sometimes

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,430
so effectively what I'm going to try and

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,160
convince you today is that you can

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,939
actually be increasing your productivity

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,330
by coding less you can instill trust in

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,399
your product by just exposing all of

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,840
your flaws and being completely naked

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,110
about what's wrong with your your

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,440
product and then also you can increase

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,750
your adoption in market penetration by

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,489
giving clients the freedom to leave so

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,450
they're not locked into your product so

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,989
just quickly we're going to introduce

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,899
Kwan connect what what our company is

00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:58,260
and the lean open source project we're

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,870
going to solve these three key problems

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,670
that quantconnect encountered I'm going

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,199
to give you some examples about how we

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,030
encountered them and how we worked

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,890
through them and as a start-up we come

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,320
at this from a very different angle to

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,409
most of the other speeches here

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,820
we're not Red Hat we've got a very

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,100
different approach and we're fighting

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,979
against those much larger competitors so

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:28,380
it's it's a fairly scrappy presentation

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:31,759
I hope you enjoy it so um before we dive

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,689
into the details we were founded about

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,700
2012 and so back then open source and

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,310
finish and none of this had really taken

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,250
shape yet so algorithms were state

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,450
secrets you couldn't talk about them you

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,060
couldn't share them they were arguably

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,759
some of the highest value software that

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,189
a bank or a trading fund makes because

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,750
it's code which makes money you write

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,640
this code you put into the financial

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,790
markets and it directly converts and

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,640
makes trades and makes money so banks

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,619
put a lot of investment into them and a

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,599
lot of investment into protecting them

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,530
and keeping them secret and keeping them

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,530
locked away and safe

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,990
it's also incredibly difficult

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:24,210
technology so you're working with the

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:27,340
bleeding edge of tech maths modeling

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,160
pulling in AI and you need it to be

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,400
incredibly stable and have incredibly

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,600
high up times so it's a very very

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,350
complex and difficult technology to

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,240
build and so that's why they spend so

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,540
much money and trying to protect it and

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,130
trying to build it some really cool

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,630
examples I'm not sure how familiar you

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:52,060
are with the algorithmic trading space

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:56,520
but we've got jump or supposedly jump

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,860
capital in Chicago building a massive

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,920
long-range radio wave antennas in the

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,270
middle of fields in Chicago and then

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,220
they have receivers over here in

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,520
Scotland and apparently they can shave

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,940
about five milliseconds by having a

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,270
long-range radio connection direct for

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,520
themselves and these these connections

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,970
they can only do five or ten kilobits of

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,709
data but they're very very low latency

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,240
so there's massive investments in the

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,459
space and it's really really fascinating

00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,600
to see what these these proprietary

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,600
trading funds are doing

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,530
so the kind of protections that people

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,810
have seen you to got all these very

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:46,110
tight legal agreements and sort of

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:49,650
gardening and non-compete clauses and as

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,519
soon as 2009 there was a guy named

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,519
Sergei a ling a ling Alena cough who was

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,480
charged by Goldman Sachs or IP

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,209
appropriation for theft and he was using

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,370
github he was just using github and

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,349
because the server was not inside the

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,239
Goldman Network they thought he was

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,569
stealing code and so there was a

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,819
ten-year legal battle with this quant

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,299
this engineer who was coding committing

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,820
his code to a repository and he's still

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,169
fighting them trying to clear his name

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,120
so there's some really interesting law

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,590
that's happening and and the banks are

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,020
slowly opening up and coming to terms

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,680
with of what open sources and how they

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,130
can use it but there's a lot of work to

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,590
be done in the same way there's also

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,210
very expensive financial data so there's

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,650
no way for individuals to really be able

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,650
to buy the starter and do it themselves

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:50,760
yeah so core connectors a was born in

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,530
this era and we believe that this sort

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,860
of technology and financial data should

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,889
be made available to everyone so we

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,680
provide engineers mathematicians

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,720
scientists anyone who wants free

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
financial data we've got about four

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,330
hundred terabytes of equities and

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,030
options futures effects starter that we

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,310
host in a web-based coding environment

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,190
so people can actually log into our

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,560
website for free there's an IDE there

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,510
with although complete and debugging and

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,490
you can just go ahead and code an

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,160
algorithm in the web browser and then

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,310
run a simulation on historical financial

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,310
data

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,330
so I've got some manifesto stuff there

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,930
you guys can check that out later but

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:42,560
yeah this is our core product so this is

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,470
the simulation result in the coding

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,900
environments up there on the top left so

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:55,639
you can open Python or C sharp files and

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:59,030
write algorithms we actually run this in

00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,719
AWS we have a cluster up there and we

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,250
provide all that for free to the users

00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:08,150
so this is all powered by our open

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,659
source product called lean lean is this

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,729
the core of the platform and we have a

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,830
continuous deployment system so every

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,680
single commit that gets merged into

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,259
master and github is available on our

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,479
website within about 10 minutes so it's

00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:26,509
a really bleeding edge and we have a lot

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:30,199
of fun with that one but today there's

00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,860
about 65,000 pumps on the platform who

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,569
have made about a million algorithms and

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,180
they've done a lot of live trading so

00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:41,680
we've got a hybrid of cloud in Colo

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,680
infrastructure for our live trading

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:53,060
globally the the community spans about

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,560
25% in Europe and about 55 in u.s. the

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,630
u.s. is just much more of a quantitative

00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,240
market right now but the communities

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:05,569
spread out all over the world one of the

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,449
fascinating things from from running an

00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:11,419
open-source quant

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,039
platform we were interviewing a

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,740
prospective team member the other day

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,810
and he worked for one of the major quant

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,569
funds and he was telling me that at

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,849
their funds they use the lean open

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,680
source project as a reference because

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,270
they don't if they need to build

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,009
something new internally they'll go to

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,240
lean they'll look up how we did it and

00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,860
they'll decide how they want to

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,650
architect their own codebase after that

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,479
so um you have a chance to do a little

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,360
bit of thought leadership in the space

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,370
and define the right way to solve some

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,350
of these problems

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,449
so we're a small team we're eight now

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,120
none of us have a finance background and

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:52,160
we all just had a passion for the

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,919
markets and we're kind of all computer

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,630
geeks and we're all happiest with

00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:03,470
headphones on and not talking to an hai

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:05,270
and we just signed a lease in Seattle so

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,490
we've got a 4,000 square foot space

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,530
there now and we're looking to grow to

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,120
about 20 30 people over the next couple

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:16,700
of years so it should be an interesting

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:22,340
couple of years however it hasn't always

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:25,400
been so rosy and great we were always

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:29,000
fighting against much larger and much

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,470
better funded competition and so I try

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,060
to make all of these problems that we're

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,050
going to talk about generic business

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,240
problems so it's it's a classic problem

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,680
that you've got competition and most of

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,120
the time they're better funded than you

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,110
and you've got to try and compete

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,600
effectively against them so whether it

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,640
was the bank's the hedge funds legacy

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,670
platforms that did algorithmic trading

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,440
or even other startups were much better

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,700
funded than we were so we were trying to

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,040
figure out ways that we could compete

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,940
and remain relevant

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,940
so I some of you might know the industry

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,160
but there's some startups up here that

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,300
received well over a hundred million in

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,570
funding and we were able to compete with

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,880
less than a million mostly bootstrapping

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:22,160
or an organic community word-of-mouth so

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,950
that kind of started with a very close

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,920
sourced and humble beginning we were

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,750
located in Chile in South America we won

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,870
a grant from the Chilean government

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:39,080
called startup Chile and that was in

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,570
2012 and we spent a lot of time and

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,290
energy building equity algorithmic

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:48,080
trading into the platform and then by

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,670
2014 we still had equities but we were

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,529
broke

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:56,459
and so at that point we had about 2,000

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,800
users and about fall paying clients but

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:03,899
two of those paying clients were family

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,610
members so we count them so effectively

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,990
at this point we were thinking what are

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,920
we doing this for where were

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,509
hard-working engineers you know we need

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,970
to have an audience of people who care

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,129
about what we're doing or we should you

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,439
know rethink what we're doing and our

00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,600
main competitor at that point had seven

00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,250
million dollars in funding so for us it

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,720
was it was like a David and Goliath

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,399
story but it wasn't all bad

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,019
we were we were working out of this

00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,000
space that we affectionately called the

00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:38,399
cupboard it was a house in Chile but it

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,670
was the back cupboard it was a storage

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,240
cupboard in their house there's an 8 by

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,730
4 little concrete block and it was

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,430
really great in the summer nice and cool

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,819
and quiet and we were able to steal

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:57,569
Wi-Fi from the neighbors with their

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:59,899
little reflector dish that we made up so

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:02,160
yeah it was just very cheap rent and

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:07,350
that's kind of where we were building

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,410
the company and open 24/7 because you

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,290
have to work all night so it needs to be

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:16,860
open at that point we were thinking

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:20,730
about open sourcing and we sort of went

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,130
through the same emotional fears that

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,920
every business or closed source company

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,750
goes through that I imagine you're

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,970
worried that your competitors will look

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,850
at your code and try and take away any

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,579
competitive advantage that you have we

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,380
were worried that people would use the

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,380
open-source platform and then just never

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,870
come back don't connect and leave us for

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,569
good and then we were worried about

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:50,540
people seeing all about glaring errors

00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:52,920
and failures and broad daylight so

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,699
actually the the only reason that was

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,009
really strong for us was that the

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,519
majority of people are a little bit lazy

00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,300
that people will pay for convenience so

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,490
even if we

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,529
open source everything not everybody

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,880
wants to spend the time and energy to go

00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,010
to an open-source project

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,839
download it set it up you know configure

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,800
all the settings and the service that

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,140
they needed so on the basis of their we

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,800
we made the bit that our value as a

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:25,680
company wasn't on the code that we were

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,540
offering it was on the ease of use about

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:33,029
how to use that code and making it as

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:35,519
easy as possible we invested a lot in

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,940
the data that we provided to the

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,519
community and the servers that the live

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,230
algorithms were running on and so those

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,180
were also competitive bandages that we

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,680
thought that just anyone going to the

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:55,800
open source project wouldn't be able to

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:58,019
replicate that easily so in June 2014 we

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,380
figured what do we have to lose let's do

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,640
this

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:06,690
and we set out on a mission to find the

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,760
100 and so the 100 was going to be 100

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,700
people who would pay at least $10 a

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,860
month just if we couldn't find 100

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,850
people who cared enough to pay $10 a

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:21,510
month we needed to go and get their jobs

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:23,279
hey go back to normal life and if we did

00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,170
find those hundred we would open-source

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,160
a project that was the the deal we made

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,950
with the community at the time so on the

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,790
crowdfunding campaign on day one we

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:38,370
reached 12 people which was effectively

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:43,110
doubling our revenue so we were over the

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:46,170
moon we were celebrating a lot that day

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:51,300
and then this was after the crowdfunding

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:53,459
that's an actual team photo of us and of

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,050
course with a hundred people painting

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,790
dollars a month there fictive lee meant

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,709
that we could buy better ramen noodles

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,110
but better

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,519
we still have proven and we've got the

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,930
validation of the community that we're

00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:11,399
looking for and yeah we Arkansas state

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:14,839
and effectively after that point we had

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,240
this enormous feature explosion that was

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:23,300
fueled by the oken so

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:25,730
so 2014-2015 we added live trading

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,330
support so previous today there was just

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,630
a back testing and simulation platform

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,950
in 2015 we added foreign exchange

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,100
algorithmic trading so you can do you

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,690
know algorithm design on forex and then

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,790
just one after the other

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:46,100
there was CFDs and futures and options

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,260
algorithms and those are really hard

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,570
doing algorithmic trading on futures and

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,520
options is a very hard problem and when

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,080
we announce that feature we had hedge

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,410
funds ring up and say hey we don't even

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,390
have that how do you do this let's let

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,330
us get your open source project so that

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:06,290
was really nice validation and then that

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:10,279
kind of peaked in 2017 we start to get

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,529
just 100% community driven massive

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,680
blocks of code submitted to the open

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:19,130
source project so it's continuing but I

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,610
mean that it's the first one was 2017 we

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,339
had a contribution of GDX crypto

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,930
brokerage to the platform and that was

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:32,980
just a 100 sync community driven

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:35,060
initiative which was really exciting so

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,339
I'll go into more detail about that

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,690
later but I'll just skip ahead to

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:43,399
problem number two so business problem

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,399
generic business problem number two is

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:50,660
that algorithmic trading is difficult

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,790
and it's a very error-prone technology

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,520
so I'm sure if you're building any sort

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:58,910
of product with that's difficult you've

00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,310
got bugs and issues with it and it's

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,020
important to get it right as a business

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,270
you don't want instability you don't

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,279
want bugs for your clients and with

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:12,500
algorithmic trading it's it's amplified

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:15,890
times a hundred times people when they

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,950
run a simulation if it doesn't give them

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,839
exactly what they think they'll blame

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,490
the platform don't think there's

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,339
something wrong with the code rather

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,529
than the algorithm that they're making

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:30,329
so imagine if you're running a hitch

00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,100
fund with twenty million dollars in it

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,139
and the algorithm isn't doing what you

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,689
think it should be doing you're paranoid

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,519
and you absolutely need to know that the

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:45,089
code is running and is doing what it

00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:48,839
should be doing so it's it's a

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:50,879
particularly sensitive problem some of

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:56,339
these in the last few years you might be

00:16:50,879 --> 00:17:00,350
familiar with so 2010 was the famous

00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:04,079
flash crash and that was just some quant

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:07,919
spoofing orders and faking the market

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:12,600
causing that one a more applicable one

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:15,149
is maybe night capital so 2012 night

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,110
capital had a simple coding bug in their

00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:20,339
algorithm without buy it market and in

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,159
sell at market and buy back at the bit

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,809
price over and over and over again

00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:26,519
thousands of times a minute and they

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,610
lost four hundred and sixty million in

00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:33,210
just a matter of forty five minutes and

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:36,269
then recently relatively recently 2013

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,639
those Associated Press Twitter was

00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:41,279
hacked and there was a tweet that went

00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:43,350
out saying that Obama was hurt in an

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,320
explosion in the White House and all of

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,720
these robots panicked and sold and the

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,350
market dipped about a point within a few

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,080
minutes percent within a few minutes so

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,760
it's very high impact technology and in

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,799
The Associated Press one was quoted at a

00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,580
hundred and forty billion dollars in a

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,340
few minutes

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,380
disappeared because of the tweet so it's

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,799
very important to get robust testing in

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,220
and to know what your algorithm is doing

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,539
so one thing that we found through doing

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,899
working with the open source project

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:20,909
closely we benefited from a massive

00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:22,049
Armony army of community reviewers in in

00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,970
our project we've got about eighty

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,399
engineers who are contributing at the

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,429
moment and thousands more who just watch

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:30,960
and consume the the project and when

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,110
something goes wrong they let you know

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,590
really fast it's really great because we

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,630
have thousands of unit tests and

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,299
regression tests and every time it is a

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,980
new commit we rerun all of these tests

00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,929
and we still miss it

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,490
still today we've got hundreds of

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,890
algorithms going through regression and

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,169
users are the ones who pick up the the

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,120
bugs because there's these weird edge

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,200
cases that they've built into their

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,320
algorithms and it's very hard to track

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,270
so we've set up community chat rooms and

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,679
this a fairly standard feature of open

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,990
source these days you've got a chat room

00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,669
for the community where you can chat

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,290
with them you get instant feedback and

00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,730
then when commit goes through and

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,860
something in their algorithm changes

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,350
they ping the public Hall Channel and

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:22,650
let you know really really fast so it's

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:27,690
been really great essentially through

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:31,470
open sourcing that code it lets it gives

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,740
people confidence in the code base

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,010
even though 99% of people won't be

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,480
reading all of the code knowing that

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,700
it's there and knowing that they can go

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,100
and view the pending issues knowing that

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,230
other people are reviewing the code base

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:52,950
gives people a lot of confidence that

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:55,440
they can they can trust the software one

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,450
second feature that we find from the

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,940
project being open-source now is the

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,320
ability of the users to communicate and

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,929
have a say in the direction of the

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,840
project there's nothing more public than

00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:12,630
a github issues list when people post

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,840
their and it spams everyone who's

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,640
watching the project it's a really great

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,260
way to get your issue hood and people

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,570
know that and they they use it and they

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,309
get their issue heard and we discuss and

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,210
when it's appropriate you know the

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,210
community can move on

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:36,159
so a second thing that's come out of it

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:39,299
what we've found is that creative and

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,679
smart people love hard problems and

00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:45,730
algorithmic trading and our platform is

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,309
a really really hard problem and so it

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,340
attracts a lot of very bright minds who

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:54,100
have enjoyed contributing to the project

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,080
to solve some of those hard problems so

00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,549
it means that we're working day-in

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,659
day-out with some very very talented

00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:04,149
people and it's a real luxury that we we

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:07,029
appreciate and we've been able to

00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:09,580
recruit most of the team through the

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,590
open source project so it's a it's a

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,869
great ground to find people who love

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,659
your project and would love to work in

00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:18,399
it day to day and you can quickly see

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,679
who is a good engineer and who isn't

00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,629
people write great code they can make

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,190
great contributions you just reach out

00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:27,789
to them and we've been able to recruit a

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,440
bunch of them into the company um it's

00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,659
also a way that we've been able to build

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,690
an audience so what I was saying before

00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:39,999
about the 100 without that audience it

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,409
doesn't really matter what you do but

00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,149
with open source you're able to quickly

00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:44,919
get an audience of people who care about

00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:48,820
your project and are following it and

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:52,629
watching it and have a vested interest

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:55,299
in seeing it succeed and many times

00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:57,369
we've actually heard back from hitch

00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,139
funds that it's much better than what

00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:02,409
they've got internally so they might be

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:06,129
working with Excel or R and sort of

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:07,840
hacking together models like that about

00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:09,789
what we can build and offer them through

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,799
the open source project is sort of

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:17,230
lightyears evolved from what they used

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:22,450
to so the the third problem that we

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:24,009
found was that with 65,000 engineers and

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,649
all the different hedge funds and

00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,830
trading funds that are using it by

00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:31,240
definition they woke up different ideas

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,499
so they've all got different ways that

00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,360
they think that they can make money

00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:37,119
different algorithms that they'll like

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,580
to deploy into the market in each each

00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,140
one is so different that it's very hard

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:52,810
for us to define a standard interface

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:57,140
for them to to build to so excuse me

00:22:52,810 --> 00:23:00,680
with needed to define ways to work with

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:03,020
the community where they can evolve and

00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,180
be as complex as they need without

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,190
actually changing the core of the

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,620
project so this is a standard

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,330
open-source problem you've got thousands

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,520
of people who want their feature built

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,730
but you've got some common feature to

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,220
the core of the project and it might not

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,870
apply to everyone and building in every

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:28,370
single feature that everybody wants is

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:31,130
impossible so what we've found so just

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,170
as an example I went through before the

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,540
presentation and tried to find all of

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:38,870
the different plug-in points in the

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:42,920
engine and I stopped when they filled up

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,570
the slide but so with finance there's

00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,400
just so many different variables and

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,000
plugins that that you need to think of

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,550
so slippage models how the the filling

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,410
price moves the transaction feed models

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:57,440
you know how much do you pay for the

00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,600
trade to go through all the different

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,520
custom data implementations how the

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,680
fills are done

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,290
I won't bore you but there's there's

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,150
hundreds of these different ways that

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:14,920
people want customizations built into

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:17,840
the project so our solution later in

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,290
2015-2016 we really started to focus on

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,590
a principle of more collaborative design

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:27,650
so we would define work with the

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,390
community to define interfaces define

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,130
what the requirements were for their

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,110
projects for their models for their

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,150
plug-in points and they figure out how

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,510
that's going to talk with our project

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:41,300
and then we would implement a few of

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,340
them so there's no way for our team to

00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,590
implement all of the models that people

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,380
want but we would implement two or three

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,150
so that they have enough of an example

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,850
code base to be able to implement the

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,820
rest and then we would spend the rest of

00:24:52,850 --> 00:25:00,790
our time writing documentation

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:03,910
and beautiful elegant HTML pictures

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:08,350
documentation and it's incredibly

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,610
painful but it's worth it in the long

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,670
run

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,860
um what we found is there with

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,470
appropriate documentation with very

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:20,050
clearly defined plug-in points the

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,870
community was able to take it from there

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:27,270
and start our building and implementing

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,130
much faster than our team ever could so

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:33,190
just recently following that code design

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:36,880
process in the last three months we've

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:39,010
had about the equivalent of a man year

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,470
of engineering contributed to the

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,570
project so it's a brokerage

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,890
implementation for the Phoenix finance

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:49,990
in new u.s. brokerage girl called alpaca

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:53,860
and so those are all things that the

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:56,530
community did using our brokerage

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,810
development guide some documentation

00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:04,800
that we wrote to help people implement

00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:06,880
brokerages that was about 40 pages

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,010
step-by-step through every single

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,720
interface and to build a brokerage

00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,980
there's there was nine chapters so it's

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,300
incredibly painful to write the

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,550
documentation but it's worth it because

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,160
just in a few months the community runs

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,500
off and does all these things and yeah

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,350
it's really awesome especially as a as a

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,480
sort of scrappy startup competing with

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,850
guys that have 50 or 100 million funding

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,040
what how can we beat them we need to

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,720
kick their ass how can we think

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:41,560
differently how can we approach these

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:48,190
challenges a different way so

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:50,110
this problem the complexity needs when

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,820
people approach a project like this if

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,290
it doesn't do everything they need to do

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,810
they're afraid they're going to be

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,210
locked in if they use it for a little

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:02,080
bit and they find a bug they're afraid

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:05,320
they're going to be locked in so what

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,910
that actually means we spend some time

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,490
to really get to know what people are

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:13,540
worried about and fear of vendor lock-in

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:15,880
is actually effectively bugs which are

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,680
not getting patched your business is

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,140
running on the software your hedge fund

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,810
is running on this and something which

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,810
is bothering you isn't getting fixed and

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,700
the software vendor isn't fixing it the

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,350
fear that your features aren't going to

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,230
be prioritized if there's something that

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:36,040
you urgently need and they've got other

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,830
priorities in the same for price hikes

00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,080
so you start using a platform and then

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:45,760
they triple the price and you can't run

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,080
the business anymore with it so all of

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,870
those things were able to effectively

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,760
eliminate with open source and the right

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:55,630
documentation and coaching out of how to

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,880
use it and it was actually through

00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,980
really emphasizing that we're not

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,690
locking you in and here's a bunch of

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,030
documentation about how you can use it

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,980
on your own here's how you can take the

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,830
lean codebase and manage it on your own

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,080
servers so if tomorrow quantconnect goes

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,510
out of business the open source projects

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,970
there in ten minutes you can use docker

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,160
deploy your own server you know connect

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,950
to a data subscription and you're done

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,540
you're up and running again what we're

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,210
actually able to find was that that

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,130
really increased our adoption so when

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,440
people came to the platform they were no

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,870
longer afraid of the vendor lock-in they

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,090
were no longer afraid of you know the

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,800
business going under and and all the

00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,220
investment of time and energy building

00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,410
those algorithms are being lost and so

00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,530
I'm counter-intuitively we were actually

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,460
able to increase our adoption by

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,200
emphasizing that they're not locked in

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:51,450
and providing them as many roots as

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,450
possible to get out of the community

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:58,310
and that was actually proven just last

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:02,210
year so our main competitor with 50

00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:04,880
million funding stopped live trading and

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,490
we had a massive migration of their user

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,080
base in 12 into our community and the

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,000
first thing they were worried about was

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,980
are you gonna go out of business or stop

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,810
live trading and so we had a massive

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:22,100
amount of documentation ready to go and

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:25,130
it was a really perfect timing so a lot

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,250
of us won't be new to you guys but in

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,050
the same way opening up the technology

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,030
gives users the freedom so that they can

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,380
go and fix those bugs themselves they

00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:37,210
can go and build the features they need

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,680
themselves and they're lock-in dissolves

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:42,080
when you're working with active

00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,940
community community members as well they

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,450
also get to shape the direction of the

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,430
project so where is it going to go and

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,350
sharing my code or my voice to be able

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,860
to contribute to that discussion which

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,860
is really cool

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,920
sir

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:13,410
I've got one last slide here so finally

00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:18,150
there was just one other part that was

00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:20,070
fairly interesting when we were going

00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:24,300
open source and trying to figure out how

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:26,580
to do it in and what to open source we

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,740
really had to go back to the two core

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,080
questions of what is our core value to

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,880
the to the users I'm trying to work this

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,850
as generically as possible so that it's

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,490
not about our technology but so how do

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,070
does quantconnect help users do our

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,620
rhythmic trading what so for you as a

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:48,240
business what is your core value and how

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:50,850
are you helping your clients so for us

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,100
it was getting these algorithms into a

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:56,370
live trading environment and making it

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,330
as easy as possible they don't want to

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,240
manage a server

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,640
people just want to design something and

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,210
put it live on their brokerage all the

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,810
rest of it is kind of inertia for them

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:11,760
so we have a massive code base but a lot

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:14,060
of it was actually directed towards

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,910
managing a web-based coding environment

00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:20,880
so we spent about two months and we cut

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:23,760
it down the middle and we defined how

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,460
the lean project would talk to our cloud

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,990
environment and we were able to split

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,400
apart potential competitors like open

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,010
sourcing parts of the business where we

00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:38,310
could be just helping competitors to our

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,380
company versus helping the community so

00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:44,190
what we found was that the lean project

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,280
is everything that a user needs to start

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,360
a hedge funds to design algorithms

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,700
completely independent of pom Connect

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,130
and a lot of our other technology that

00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,860
we didn't open source was the cloud

00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:02,220
technology so debugging technology

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,470
compiling running a simulation and

00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,780
managing a cloud like none of that is

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,040
really relative to an individual so we

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,420
knew when you go to do that open

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,610
sourcing you might want to think about

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,260
what your open sourcing and defining

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:17,570
clear lines there too

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:42,050
yeah thank you very much if you've got

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:45,560
questions right we for many years it was

00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,960
a simple like Server licensing so when

00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,550
you go to Amazon you'll you'll Lisa a

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,440
virtual machine there's something

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:55,340
similar to that for for algorithmic

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,160
trading but recently we started to

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,400
explore working with the proprietary

00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,670
trading funds and licensing the

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,170
algorithms that the communities making

00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,570
so that there's over a million

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,850
algorithms and you know 60,000 smart

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,530
people who are coding so now we're

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,270
trying to connect all those people with

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,160
funding and banks we might want to

00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,160
recruit them or use their code a

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,310
marketplace yeah

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,050
well that's fine

00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:08,669
in the early days I don't know yeah and

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,260
the early days those very little

00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:15,720
motivation and this is this is today

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:19,470
we're but then back then there was maybe

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,230
five people we really value every single

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:24,450
contributor because the peripheral one

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:28,280
that's writing code is a hundred who are

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,280
just reading and downloading the code

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:48,540
yeah and it's actually the people who

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:52,599
are contributing now that the project is

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,810
is maybe 10 or 15 men years of work and

00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,810
a lot of people is a relatively new

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:01,000
industry so this that they they go and

00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,920
start the project themselves they start

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,530
to build it and then they quickly

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,260
realize after a month or two wow this is

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,300
a like a massive amount of work and I

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,890
can't do it myself and so then they go

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,720
to Google and they try to find other

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,390
platforms so that they don't have to

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,250
build it themselves and oftentimes with

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,720
the first result in Google so they'll

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,260
come to our our website

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,520
you know um github and they'll go wow

00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,140
this is everything that I wanted to

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,000
build but you've already built it in its

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:33,190
open source so they're just it's I think

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,470
they like to contribute because it's

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:41,410
just blown the world up of what they

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:43,000
could do now yeah yeah I don't think

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,859
there's any direct financial or any

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,609
other obvious motivation this is

00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:47,609
generosity

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:59,460
cool thank you very much

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,960
[Applause]
