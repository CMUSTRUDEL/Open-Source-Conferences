okay

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
so hopefully this is working hi everyone

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
um

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,559
i'm freddie so i am a engineer at

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,160
deutsche bank

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,240
and i'm going to talk you through a

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,520
project that we've been working on with

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
finos

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,439
for about 18 months now called the cloud

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,880
service certification project

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,640
so i'll quickly introduce myself

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,120
so i work in p l technology at deutsche

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,559
i've been with the bank for about two

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,040
years and i've been working on this

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,239
project

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,800
for about 18 months pretty much since we

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
first got involved with it so i'm going

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
to talk you through

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,399
cloud service certification the idea

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,719
behind

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,440
the cloud service certification project

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
is

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
that all major banks

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,120
pretty much are trying to adopt public

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,320
cloud one way or another

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,040
and the way they're doing that

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
is by going through each service and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,159
working out

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,840
what risks they need to calculate and

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,240
and what their settings need to say

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,600
on their um cloud services so if you're

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,400
trying to create a

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,640
um if you're trying to put bank data in

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
a postgres database on the cloud for

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
example

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,960
you would need to have certain

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,479
settings enabled like maybe encryption

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,520
at rest or encryption in transit

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
the ramifications of that is that as a

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,799
bank

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,520
if you're trying to adopt public cloud

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
developers

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,960
in banks are generally used to

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
only being able to create things that

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,880
are compliant and secure

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,360
so if i'm a so i'm a developer at the

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,399
bank

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,040
and i don't go into deutsche bank's

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,159
policy

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,759
documents and make sure that i can do

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,600
what i'm about to do

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,920
before i deploy to openshift internally

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,800
for example

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
i just do it and the reason i can do

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,640
that

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,879
is because i know that anything

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
i'm able to do within deutsche bank's

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,319
network

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
is compliant and secure and complies

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,360
with the bank's risk appetite

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
that is often taken for granted by

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,800
people who work in banks

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,239
um but there's a huge amount of work

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
that goes into

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
enabling that to be the case and making

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
it easy for developers to focus on

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,160
solving their problems rather than

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
constantly thinking about

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,480
am i missing a regulation here and there

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
and of course the reality is that even

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
if

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,840
um even if banks did require developers

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
to go and look at those policies

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,959
that wouldn't be a workable way forward

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,640
because um

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
there's just too much to think about you

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,480
know deutsche are operating in

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,280
around 80 countries um and we've got

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,159
nearly 100 000 staff and and some banks

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,239
are bigger

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,000
and so you know that that's that's not

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,440
really workable to say to a developer

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
every time you want to do anything you

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
have to go and check those policies so

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
we've got to maintain that ability for

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
anything to ha

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
anything that happens internally is

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
compliant and secure

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,480
by nature so how do we maintain that

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,519
while we're adopting public cloud

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
that's what the cloud service

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,040
certification project aims to um

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,000
aims to achieve so

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,040
a quick introduction to the project the

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
collaborators

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,159
um to the cloud service certification

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
project

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,239
are mainly have mainly been deutsche and

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,720
jp morgan

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,120
up until a few months ago really finos

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,440
has been leading the project and finnos

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
as many of you will know is a linux

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,440
foundation

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,640
member um joining this year

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,680
and uh so the finnos team have kind of

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
guided

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
deutsche and and jpm to lead this

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
project

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
um we've had a lot more collaborators

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
getting involved

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,239
over the last uh well during 2020 really

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,319
we've now got morgan stanley we've had

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,080
ubs involvement we've had a lot of help

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,760
from red hat

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
and then the cloud providers themselves

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,239
microsoft and google

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
and various um other companies we've had

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,280
cs we've had

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,880
city hub and um and consulting companies

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,000
that are helping us to

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,040
kind of work out the most efficient way

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
of of collaborating and solve some of

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
the technical challenges with us

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,840
so that's that's the collaborators do it

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
um and and there's sort of

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
banks are in and out on this project and

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,000
we're we're really pushing this because

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
we've

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,240
we've kind of seen that this could be a

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,240
really really valuable asset for us

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,960
so the project purpose um

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
the mission of the cloud service

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
certification working group is to

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
accelerate the development deployment

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
and adoption of a common set of controls

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
and tests for cloud services

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
you can see that on the screen um and so

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
that that

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,800
the long and the short of that is that

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,199
we want

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
adoption of public cloud for banks to be

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
very easy

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,080
and we've recognized that there's no

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
intellectual property for banks in the

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,240
ability

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,120
to adopt public cloud right so um you

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
know our rip does not sit in our ability

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,160
to adopt public cloud all banks are

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,240
trying to achieve the same thing

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,320
a lot of banks are trying to comply with

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,120
the same regulations so

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,639
rather than reinventing the wheel and

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
kind of over and over again

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,400
all of us coming to the same conclusions

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,520
about the same services

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,080
um we we're just collaborating and doing

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,000
that work

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,160
centrally so why is this

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
why is this necessary well the majority

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
of cloud security incidents

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
are due to human error so you can read

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,080
the quote on screen

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
and capital one is a really good example

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,960
of this um

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,280
apologies if anyone from capital one's

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,960
on the call but

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,840
last year capital one had a breach

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
in public cloud so they put some data in

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,560
the public cloud

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,639
in an aws i think it was an ec2 bucket

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,240
and that data was compromised

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,199
that data however was not hacked

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,919
in the in the sort of brute force sense

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,880
of the word

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,240
so um it was a it was a misconfigured

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
container

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,720
and so where does the blame sit so this

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,639
was one of the first

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
the first problems of its kind and this

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,840
was a really interesting case study for

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,880
those of us that work in financial

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,400
services

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,560
because what it says is um okay so it

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,720
wasn't aws's fault because the container

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,919
did exactly what it was supposed to do

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,280
was it capital one's fault well

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,479
maybe but um that that it was

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,800
it was a case of not having um

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,440
i guess tested the the different

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,440
settings in aws and of course

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
that um that those switches are not

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,919
owned by capital one themselves and

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,120
you know these these cloud services are

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
uh a complex

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,759
and there's a lot of um

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
there's a lot of switches there's a lot

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,759
of settings that you can apply to all

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
the different services particularly when

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
you're working

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,160
um across different cloud providers

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,680
google

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,800
azure aws ali cloud

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,440
etc ibm oracle and

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,919
uh the result of that was the us bank

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
shares

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,919
slid nearly six percent um and and there

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
was a hack affecting over 100 million

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,400
customers which is

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,639
you know that's that's what we're all

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,879
trying to avoid really

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
so from the bank's point of view what

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,919
this project provides

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,400
is much stronger controls um

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,599
proof of compliance so we will be able

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
to

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,720
prove to regulators uh to audit

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,199
and internally that um what we're

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,599
running

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
in the public cloud is compliant because

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,240
we'll have tests that show us that

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,400
um genuine multi-cloud so a lot of banks

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,639
are talking about multi-cloud

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,080
that's kind of not a reality for for a

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
lot of banks it's sort of one or the

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,080
other because

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,919
of the overhead of adopting an

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,479
individual set of services you know if

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,400
you

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:30,160
if you decide as a bank to adopt

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
gcp for example then you have to train

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,719
your people

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,680
in how gcp works you have to

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,479
know what is available in gcp and you

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,800
have to make

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:46,160
those risk appetite decisions about

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,440
whether what your requirements are for

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
the containers that you're

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,560
you're spinning up in gcp

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
this project will also provide very fast

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,920
switching between

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
cloud providers and that can be

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,480
beneficial where

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,240
you know banks want to diversify across

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,640
providers rather than having all their

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,839
eggs in one basket as it were

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
and it also provides the the engineering

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,920
culture

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
which is a huge challenge for banks i

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
think trying to build

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
you know huge numbers of technologists

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
and trying to operate

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,640
like uh in that in that kind of famous

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,720
tech startup culture

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,360
that the public cloud providers and you

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,600
know big tech firms do so well

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,440
and you know working really closely with

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,519
those companies on this project

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,839
provides a huge engineering culture

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,160
benefit to the banks as well

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,240
from the tech contributors point of view

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,920
um it's access to the financial services

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
industry which is you know one of the

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
oldest and most powerful industries in

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,200
the world

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,519
um and an incredibly difficult industry

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,880
to get into and understand

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,959
as an outsider and so you know my next

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,000
point a more in-depth understanding

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,680
the the the cloud providers particularly

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
are really keen to understand the

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
challenges faced by

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
financial services providers because so

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,399
many of their customers just don't have

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
those kind of challenges particularly

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,399
when you're a bank operating

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,560
you know globally across regulatory

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,160
jurisdictions

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,000
and it also gives them influence over

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
the public cloud choice so you know

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
working with us on these projects allows

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
the public cloud providers to show the

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
the power of their

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,279
platforms and um and what's what's

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,279
available what they can offer us

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,519
so how exactly does this work um so

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,560
for each service we'll go through this

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,120
workflow that you can see on screen so

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,360
uh it will pick a service like um

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,279
postgres for example

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
yeah microsoft azure has a has a

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,640
postgres database

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,160
um ingrained in it so first we'll we'll

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,760
build a policy document

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,760
we call that a service approval

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,360
accelerator and that is

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,279
defining the parameters of our

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,279
risk appetite for that service so that's

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,480
talking about

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,839
what is compulsory what is optional

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,160
and and how should those constraints

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
look

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,040
on public cloud so what should we um

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,959
you know for a database for example do

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,480
we need encryption at rest do we need

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,920
encryption in transit

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,880
um what which ip address ranges can we

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
expose

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,480
and what are the options there as well

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
so the service approval accelerator not

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
only says

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
okay all banks have to comply with this

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,519
or or we don't need to care about these

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,200
but it actually also says

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
so there's some options here depending

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
on what kind of data you're putting in

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
the cloud

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,600
and from a financial services point of

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
view that's really valuable because

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
of course the cloud providers themselves

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
could tell us

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,200
it could tell us what options there are

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
but they're not going to be able to give

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
us the kind of

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,320
insight from a financial services point

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,760
of view as to okay

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,519
this might be required by x regulator or

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,560
there might be a knock-on effect of a

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,079
certain of a certain setting

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
so once we've defined that service

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,880
approval accelerator that that policy

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,160
document

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,959
we then move on to creating bdd

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,800
test scenarios so we want we really want

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,120
this to be easily accessible

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,320
easily readable and as new developers

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
out there will know

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,680
um you know gurken files give and when

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,880
then cases are

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,519
really um really structured easy to

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,760
understand way of writing tests

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,160
at the top level and a really good way

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
of mapping tests onto requirements we've

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,360
defined those requirements in the policy

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,760
document we're now mapping them on to

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,600
those bdd test scenarios

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
so we've written our bdd test scenarios

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
our gurken feature files

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,639
we then map that further onto policy as

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,480
code

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,079
and that can be terraform uh we're

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,240
currently having a discussion

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:52,399
over um uh terraform versus

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,880
uh a couple of other providers and

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
that that policy is code will allow us

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,279
to

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,800
um spin up uh actually spin up the

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,839
containers themselves

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,440
using the um compliances code that

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
that's in our repository

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,120
so if you're a bank and you're wanting

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
to create a postgres database and you

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
want to comply with

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
certain settings you can download these

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
terraform scripts and spin it up and you

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,040
know that they're

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
thoroughly tested and you've got the bdd

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,040
scenarios and you've got the

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,480
policy document to explain exactly what

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,519
regulations you're

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,880
you're complying with and finally you've

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,480
got your test fixtures

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,200
so those are kind of back testing

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
on the bdd and on your terraform scripts

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,480
to ensure

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,920
that once you've created your um once

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,199
you've created your containers

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,959
those are indeed doing what they're

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,839
supposed to do and

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
you know you can kind of test that the

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,279
um

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,720
that the behavior is as it's expected

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,440
so let's go and look at some code so

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,040
i'll flip over to our github repository

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
and this is just illustrating at the

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,800
moment we've got google kubernetes

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,320
engine is a work in progress

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,120
postgres on azure deutsche has just

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,800
contributed their

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,639
service approval accelerator for that

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,399
and amazon redshift was

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,079
contributed by jp morgan previously

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,560
so this is the cloud service

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
certification main project

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,399
it's open anyone can join it and if

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
developers would like to get involved

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
then then please do drop me a message

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,240
afterwards let me know

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,839
um so we've got a project wiki which

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
explains a little bit more about it i'll

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,000
show you the

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
service approval accelerator for

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
postgres because i think that's a really

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,079
good

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,000
place to start so the format is a

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,279
markdown file we want all of it to stay

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
in this github so that we've got a

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,320
single

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,839
single place to access the whole project

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
and so that as i say

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,360
it's as accessible as possible it's as

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,199
easy to understand

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
and really lots of different financial

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,639
services institutions can access this

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,519
information

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,519
so if i flick through a couple of these

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
identity and access management for

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,720
example

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,760
if we look at authorization we're saying

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,079
that it's recommended to only assign

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,880
active directory azure active directory

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,959
groups

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,959
within postgres and not create

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
individual users within postgres itself

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,600
so

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,040
um what we're saying is that you'd have

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,279
an active directory

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,320
as your active directory instance um

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,760
honors you

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,519
and those roles are used to define the

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,680
access to your database

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,680
um so that's an example of a specific

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,759
you know we're saying this is the the

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,720
way we think you're going to have best

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,839
control

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,440
over your authorization to your postgres

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
database

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
so if i flick down to another one uh

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,320
we've got encryption at rest

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,839
so we want encryption at rest it's

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,199
required for data governance and

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
compliance efforts

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,880
we've cited a few government and

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,000
industry regulations

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,160
hipaa pci fedramp

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
laying out specific safeguards regarding

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,360
data protection and encryption

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,360
requirements

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
and we're also saying that we want that

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,639
data encryption to be using customer

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,920
managed keys

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,560
um so azure allows you to bring your own

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,120
key by ok for data protection at rest

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,800
and that allows you to actually hold the

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
keys yourself rather than having the

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,839
keys stored in

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,440
as your as your key store so you can

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,320
flick through this service approval

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,800
acceleration you can see plenty of um

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,199
there's lots of examples so ip firewall

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,759
rules we're onto network security now

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,440
um and we're saying that if you want to

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,279
create your network on azure

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,360
then we've got some recommendations for

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,240
how you could build that

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
creating proxies to allow you to access

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
your

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,680
company network from azure obviously not

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,160
opening your

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,600
public ip addresses to the outside world

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,959
so you only want to be able to access

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,160
that from within your company network

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,320
so that's the service approval

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,320
accelerator uh i'll show you

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,839
an example quick example of a bit of

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,639
code so we've got some we've got some

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,720
pull requests open here

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,600
and kubernetes we have

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,760
let me find the right one we've got some

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,760
terraform scripts being contributed as

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
well

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,679
this is really slope apologies

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,520
okay here we go so we've got some

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,280
kubernetes scripts here

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,520
and here's the service approval

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
accelerator for our google kubernetes

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
engine

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,400
um that's our markdown file and then we

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
go in here and you can see

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
we've got some terraform scripts so if i

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,919
open up the main terraform script

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
you can see we're creating google

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,960
compute network compute firewall

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
right the way down to the kubernetes

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,559
cluster here

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and that's using the settings that we've

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,280
recommended in our server

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,559
service approval accelerator so that's

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,400
how we recommend

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,240
um we're gonna we're gonna go forward

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,799
we're really trying to start with

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,919
the code and uh so we're going from the

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,600
ground up and where

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
this project is saying let's just pick a

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,520
service and

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
any of the companies involved in this

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,080
project can pick a service and go ahead

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
and

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
you know start start building um

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,600
defining the service approval

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,320
accelerator that's then discussed by the

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,720
group

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,160
um and then that that information is

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,200
contributed to the repository

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,440
via pull requests so for deutsche that's

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,360
linked up to our internal

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,760
bit bucket repository and we can push

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,360
that over a proxy to the outside world

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,880
for some companies it's not that

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,400
difficult

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
but yeah if you'd like to get involved

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
then please do let me know um

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,320
we really welcome individuals and

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
organizations to get involved in this

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,679
project

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,440
um whether you're wanting to contribute

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,360
terraform whether you're

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,559
more on the cloud side or indeed just

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,480
wanting to get involved in the

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,160
discussions around the risk appetites

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,039
and service approval accelerators

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,480
that would be really valuable to us so

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,080
i'm going to open it up for questions

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,440
and thank you very much for listening i

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,360
hope you have a really good

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,039
open source strategy forum

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,039
cool so i think i'm live now so if

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,600
anyone wants to ask any questions please

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,520
do

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,720
um i think you if you type them into the

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:25,840
chat then

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,840
i'll read them out and answer them live

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
i'll stick around for the slot which is

00:19:50,080 --> 00:20:07,840
another 10 minutes so

00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:07,840
yeah please do ask any questions

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
have we had the chance to take any of

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
the constitutions back into db yet

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,799
that's a great question by james

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,600
um james is the champion of the project

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,960
he's um

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,640
one of the few people that's been on it

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,240
for longer than i have so

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
um yeah that's that's a great question

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
so the ultimate goal of this project

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,480
right is that

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,400
we have um the scripts these tests the

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,760
service approval accelerators

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,039
and we have that covering um you know

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,720
a good proportion of the services on

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,440
predominantly the three main cloud

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,880
providers um google cloud aws

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,080
and microsoft azure and we want um to

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,440
have that catalog

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,360
of artifacts that banks can reconsume

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,960
so deutsche bank if you've been

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,480
following the cloud news

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,600
has just given a really good example

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,559
of how this project could be valuable so

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,720
deutsche has

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,360
signed a letter of intent with google

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,480
to work on a 10-year strategic

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
partnership

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,720
and i don't have many details um but i'm

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
not really able to talk about it anyway

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
so

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:39,440
i won't but um previously

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,440
i can say that we were looking at azure

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,760
as a solution and because of our

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,520
strategic partnership we're now moving

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,240
to gcp as part of the wider program

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,919
so we're really demonstrating a great

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,480
use case for this project

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
because if this project was in a more

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,760
advanced stage

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,480
then we would have a catalog of

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,679
artifacts that we could use to reconsume

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,559
on gcp

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,600
so for example we've done all this work

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,960
on azure

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,960
on working out the settings required for

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
a postgres container or for azure

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,039
kubernetes um

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,840
as your kubernetes service and we want

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,120
to move that

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,559
onto gcp sql database or google

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,440
kubernetes engine

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,520
and we will have the mapping in the

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,919
cloud service certification project

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,520
which has been tested by another bank

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,799
using google cloud

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,480
um using google kubernetes engine in gcp

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,640
and we could just reconsume that and

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
there's no there's no ip issue there so

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,159
the point i was making in the

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,760
presentation is that there's no problem

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,679
with um the banks

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
sharing this information because it's

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,640
not intellectual property

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,159
it's just a case of how quickly can we

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,559
get through our road maps to public

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
cloud

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,200
so we've got another question um has

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,039
there been any consideration

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,559
as to how these service accelerators can

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,840
be tested once

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,440
people merge in new templates so um

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,080
thank you for the question adam and we

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,480
at the moment the process is we have a

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
very

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,120
open group of individuals on the cloud

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,320
service certification

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,760
call and um pull requests are reviewed

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,960
by the wider audience

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,840
often we break out and work

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,960
with specific organizations together so

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
some of the big banks

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
um deutsche and jp morgan mainly have

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,799
done some work together um

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,679
reviewing prs the service approval

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,159
accelerators

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
and the artifacts generally are

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,440
contributed

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
from one organization which has

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,679
developed it

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,559
and that is pushed into the repository

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,799
um and then once it's once it's

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,919
available and the pr is raised then the

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
group can

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,039
look at um how we can merge that and

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
whether there's any feedback we'd like

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,000
to give

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,159
and that might be valuable feedback that

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,080
the contributing organization can

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,120
reconsume as well right

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,000
um but uh once people merge in new

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,679
templates

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,520
we will try them and um you know so

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
i'll if i if i come up with a

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,679
hypothetical example where

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,440
there is a google kubernetes engine

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,600
service approval accelerator

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
in our repository already and deutsche

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
bank are looking

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,799
as part of our new deal to move

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,880
to use gke we would reconsume the

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,000
service approval accelerator on gke we'd

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,720
obviously

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,320
review it internally but all the headway

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
is done and we know

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,559
that you know bank x up here in um

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
global banking

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,480
and we know that they that the

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,600
regulators are happy with them

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,360
using gke using the parameters that

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
they've defined in the service approval

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,720
accelerator

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,200
and the regulators are happy um and

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
their

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
their internal security and compliance

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
are happy

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,440
so we're pretty sure that that service

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
approval accelerator is going to be

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
something close to what we want to use

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,640
as well

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,400
so we reconsume the gke service approval

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,159
accelerator we have a look at it

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
there might be some organizationally

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,039
specific changes we want to make

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,600
um you know we might operate in regions

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,200
that have a specific legislation that

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,159
the other bank might not have to worry

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,159
about

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,320
so obviously we'll do an internal review

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,320
but

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
to public cloud another point in this is

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,279
it's it's it's solving

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,120
the problem whereby banks have to go

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,400
through and analyze the risk down to the

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,559
lowest detail

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,240
um and go through each service because

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,919
we have this document already and we can

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,039
take this to our internal security and

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,840
compliance teams

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,480
and say this is used by another bank is

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
there anything

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
else that we have to think about is

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
there anything else that you would like

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
to

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,480
change as part of our risk appetite but

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,159
actually that's a huge start and you

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
know that could save months if not years

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,200
of work

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,559
on some of the more complex services to

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,159
to accelerate that adoption roadmap

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,679
i hope i've answered that please do

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:11,840
follow up if you'd like to ask anything

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:11,840
else on that

it i can give a quick update so

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,120
deutsche bank are currently looking at

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,159
contributing the rest of the work we did

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,000
on azure before we made the move to gcp

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,320
um and then there is a pr for gcp

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,640
for google kubernetes engine rather

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,679
which i think has just been approved

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,760
um so google kubernetes engine is now in

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,399
the repository if not just before

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,679
being part of the repository uh we tend

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,080
to try and merge the prs

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,480
on the project call um because that's

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,000
exciting and we can all approve it

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,039
um we have the lead maintainer is

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,240
a member of deutsche bank

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,399
um and uh he's you know done a

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,919
huge amount of our work on azure and

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,559
google cloud

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,760
um we've got quite a lot of work in the

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,760
catalog at the moment that was

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,640
originally contributed by jp morgan on

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
aws

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,919
but i'm not aware that there is a

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,520
contributor to the aws

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,000
work at the moment so if anyone would

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,120
like to pick that up then please do

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,640
um google is getting a lot of interest

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,559
partly because deutsche are interested

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,480
in it and partly because we've got

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,919
other contributors that are keen to get

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,120
involved in that too

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,880
and then there's some azure work in

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,240
there which really needs fleshing out so

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,320
a lot of the time we kind of

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,840
contribute the um service approval

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,760
accelerators first and then

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,720
flesh out the code the terraform the

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
tests etc

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,440
so um yeah so it would be really good to

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,679
get those fleshed out i think we're out

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,200
of time so i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap up

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,720
and thank you very much for joining

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,240

and please do get involved we're really

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,840
