all right

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,760
good morning good afternoon uh thank you

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,840
for joining me today my name is

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,080
andrew aiken and i'm the global open

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,640
source practice leader for wipro

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
i'm really excited to share this topic

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
with you today

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
um i i hope that you each and every one

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
of you is able to take away

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,400
a few tidbits that will allow you to do

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,840
your open source planning

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
a little bit more efficiently and

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,640
effectively uh

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000
so there are obviously a whole bunch of

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
ways to do this

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,480
but uh i wanted to share a model and an

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
approach that

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
i and my team have developed over the

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,440
years uh that that is

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,039
that really hopefully will help you be

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
able to get at some of the

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
core decisions pretty quickly this is

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,039
not a

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,360
a very detailed sophisticated uh

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,559
approach uh obviously it's a complex

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,960
topic uh

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,840
and there are many many elements that go

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,479
into building an

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
enterprise-wide plan and so we're going

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,840
to tackle

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
just one aspect of it today and that's

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,439
how to

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
leverage open source to help drive some

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:27,840
of your key

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:27,840
initiatives from a planning perspective

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,520
just a second here the slide doesn't

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
seem to want to move

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
there we go all right uh so for those of

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,040
you who may not be familiar with

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
with wipro we are one of the large

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
global systems integrators around 9

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,520
billion in revenue

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,600
and uh over 180 000 employees

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
what's more more relevant here is we

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,719
have a we have a lot of rich

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,040
deep experience in open source uh

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
coming from hundreds and hundreds of

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,119
different projects

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,200
uh across the globe and across all

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,840
domains virtual

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,360
so i've been in open source for about 22

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
years now

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,080
i did launch the first uh open source

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,480
strategy consulting firm

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,440
way back when ran that for 11 years and

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,680
then sold it to black duck software

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
i also launched the open source think

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
tank which was

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,440
an uh biannual event held in napa

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,080
california and paris france

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
uh each year where we brought in a 120

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
of the top

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
open source thought leaders to really

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,599
just got a brainstorm on how

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,160
open source was evolving the

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,959
opportunities the challenges and so on

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,440
and have had the opportunity to to work

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
on

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,760
a couple of 100 different projects

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,640
for most of the major oems and isvs

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,400
for 20 or 30 different open source and

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,120
proprietary software startups and

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
certainly for

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
dozens of large enterprises so have a

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
pretty pretty good background on

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
on the topic here today and hopefully

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,800
that that comes through for you

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
so why are we talking about building an

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,440
enterprise wide open source

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,560
strategy uh especially

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
when enterprises have so many other

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,400
strategies whether it's around

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
your digital transformation journey

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,920
legacy modernization

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,959
moving to the cloud uh well there is one

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,000
key factor that underpins all of these

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,599
and it is it is open source it is the

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
core building block for

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
all these major initiatives that happen

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,959
today

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
and so if you're not treating it

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,599
strategically and planning for it

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,239
then that can certainly have a resulting

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
negative

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,879
impact on some of the other key

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:50,319
initiatives in the organization

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,840
so another uh another way to

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,120
to kind of uh determine

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,879
why this is important to uh to build an

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
open source strategy

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,519
is around what we hear from your peers

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
so my team's been very careful over the

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,640
last couple of years we've been asking

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,239
your peers why they're investing in open

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,760
source why they stay with open source

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,879
why they make more and more commitments

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
to open source

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
and so this is what we hear from from

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,440
our clients this is not what we say this

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,240
is not what analysts say

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
so open source really does have the

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,479
ability to drive

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,520
innovation in the enterprise

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,360
it also allows you to fail fast which

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,479
means that you can try something if it

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
works that's great

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,520
if it doesn't you can move on quickly uh

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,120
with

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
little to no repercussions for doing

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
that um it allows your developers to get

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
productive much faster we have one

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
client that calls this

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
zero day productivity so they've

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,199
identified they've defined

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,160
that uh how an open source developer

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,400
becomes

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
more productive on their open source

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,680
based applications

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,600
versus those that they hire to work on

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,520
their complex package proprietary

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,880
software applications

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
open source also allows you to recruit

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
and retain

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
your best developers and it can have a

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,840
very positive impact

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
on your brand and overall reputation

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
so that i want to talk about a couple of

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,160
assumptions

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,000
that we can make as it relates to to

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
building an open source strategy

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,280
one is at a very very high industry

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
level uh we hear

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
frequently everyone wants to be a tech

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
company right

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,520
and one of my favorite uh actual

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
taglines

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,919
from a client of ours uh not in

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
financial services but i thought this is

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,919
pretty interesting is today

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,680
we're a wholesome food provider but

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,720
tomorrow we want to be a technology

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
company offering

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,080
innovative protein-centric foods

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
my view on this is that some some

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
companies can take this just a little

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
too far

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,639
but for those who do who are trying to

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,560
make that transformation to becoming

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,479
more of a technology organization

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
many of them are calling out open source

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,560
as one of the key

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:09,120
catalysts to help them to do this so

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
some more direct or relevant assumptions

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,960
that we can make

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,520
uh today you are almost guaranteed to be

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,759
using

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,520
more open source than you think you are

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,919
regardless of whether or not you have

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,600
a strong governance program you will

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,600
probably be using more in the future

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
than you think you will

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
today open source is becoming more of a

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
strategic

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
uh imperative within your organization

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
as opposed to simply a set

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,680
of tactical i.t component components in

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,560
your it infrastructure

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,360
growing a community is is hard and

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,759
that's not likely to change

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,280
there will always be cost pressures on

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,199
your organizations

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,599
and we're all members of what i like to

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
call the baskin-robbins enterprise so

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,960
baskin robin's favorite tagline is they

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
have 31 flavors

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
one for each day of the month well when

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
we get involved

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,840
with with large clients large

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
enterprises financial services

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
organizations

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
we like to call on this because every

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
line of business every

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
development group has their own 31

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
flavors of open source that they want to

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
use

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,840
which makes all of our jobs a little bit

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
more complex

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
so every organization is on an open

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,759
source

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,840
journey today and it's important

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,800
to understand kind of where you are and

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,759
the attributes

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
of where you are on your journey on a

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
maturity curve

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,000
this really helps with the planning

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
exercise so we're going to talk about

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,840
that

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
identifying that where you are a little

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,400
bit

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,520
so excuse me a part of being on

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,160
on this journey is always about the

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,800
value

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,280
you derive from open source versus the

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,759
amount of effort that you pull in

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
and this is a model that we've uh that

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,319
we've built over the years it's it's

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,560
a set of buckets uh of characteristics

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
or

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,599
attributes um that we've observed uh

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,520
from from obviously uh open source is

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
kind of famous for being grounds up or

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,879
ad hoc

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,479
um as an organization begins to realize

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,080
that open source is important

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,639
they begin to try and implement some

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,240
policies and processes then they begin

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,840
to try and spread this across the

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
organization to become a bit more

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,680
directed

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,000
and active the next step is beginning to

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,080
internally and externally collaborate

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,599
to create business value and then the

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
last stage is kind of

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
realizing a realization of the full

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
benefits of open source their leadership

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
leadership is involved there's been a

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,440
cultural transformation

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
and so on so it's also important to

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,279
understand

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,440
that an enterprise can be on multiple

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,480
points on this maturity curve or this or

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
this journey

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
uh frequently it's the case that when we

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,040
get involved with

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
with companies a one line of business

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
may be

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
farther towards the left another line of

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,680
business may be farther towards the

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,959
right

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,800
and that's just kind of the nature of

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,760
having a global distributed enterprise

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,360
today

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
and so you may need to go through an

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,160
exercise of identifying

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
where each line of business is and then

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,000
helping create kind of a lowest common

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,000
denominator across the organization

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,959
so each one of the stages of this

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
maturity curve

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,200
can be broken down a little bit further

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
into a set of attributes that are

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
associated with with it

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,200
so at the and these attributes are

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
broken down by

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,080
the constituents the developers the

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,680
operational the support folks legal

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,040
procurement security hr and so on

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,800
a set of capabilities um the

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
the how value is created in the

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,640
organization and the overall

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,600
organizational leadership and culture

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,959
so for example at the ad hoc level

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
developers are certainly beginning to

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,880
use more and more open source

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,240
typically operations at this point are

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,680
unregulated

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,600
capabilities are very uneven or sporadic

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,560
across the organization

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,399
not really aware of how value is is

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
actually being created or what that

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
value is

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,720
it's typically individual developers

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
that

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
find a cool technology that solves a

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
particular problem they have in that

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
moment

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,279
and they're seeing some value but

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
there's no organizational understanding

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,160
of how that value is being captured

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,760
and and behaviors tends to be a bit

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,079
bureaucratic and

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,920
[Music]

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,279
somewhat unreasonable at that point

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,640
because there's typically a lack of a

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,440
lack of understanding

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,040
that's going on so as you move up the

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,720
maturity curve you move a little bit

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,800
farther to the right the attributes

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,279
obviously begin to change a bit

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
uh we can talk about the collaboration

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
when you when you begin to reach that

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
collaboration level

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,760
developers are beginning to work

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,760
together to co-create value

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,519
the operations at that level are two

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,519
there's probably some sort of

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
automation that's involved there's

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,120
detailed

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
processes and policies in the training

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
program and so on

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,640
your developers are becoming more and

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
more skilled they're active contributors

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,480
at this point and

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
you can actually see both individually

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,839
and collectively their skills

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
are growing by being more engaged in

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,839
open source

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,519
value creation is more in integrated

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
across the organization

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
uh groups are beginning to to work

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,120
together more closely

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
to either drive more innovation to

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
reduce your technology debt to reduce

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
costs whatever

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,560
the focus is and now we're beginning to

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,600
to have a culture that's beginning to

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,959
become more open

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,079
transparent collaborative and you see

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,200
again more and more executive leadership

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,480
at this level also so again this is

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,760
this is a way to look at how to and to

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,440
understand where you are

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,440
on the maturity curve and the certain

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,720
attributes that are associated with

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,880
with each step

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
so let's get started let's let's spend a

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
few minutes on

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,760
on going through and kind of building a

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,200
a sample

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,320
uh decision support model around uh

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
open source here so obviously

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
you have to start with what you're

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
trying to achieve

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
and here are some common uh common

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
aspects of open source

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
of what people believe that open source

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,160
can help them impact

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,600
create new revenue models reduce cost

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,800
improve innovation improve the brand and

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
reputation

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
and developer productivity so it's

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
really important to to

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
start by trying to understand what are

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,839
we trying to achieve and in most

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,760
organizations you're trying to achieve

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,120
one two or all of these

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,120
right but we're just going to go through

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
one today and i'm going to pick

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
a brand enhancement one of those kind of

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
squishy things but we do hear this in

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
almost every engagement we get into

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,880
today

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,200
our clients want to improve their brand

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,959
or

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,639
or improve their reputation and they

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,639
think open source is a way to do so

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
so okay let's talk about why

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,959
first thing problem statement i've

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,600
crafted one here so our customers

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,720
don't perceive us as providing modern or

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,800
innovative banking capabilities

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
pretty simple and straightforward we

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,560
have heard these exact words used a few

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,360
times maybe it resonates with somebody

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,920
some of you uh in the audience today uh

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
so then

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,560
let's let's break that down a little bit

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,600
and i like to use some very simple root

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,639
cause analysis

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,680
uh models uh very very simple but

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,079
let's say we've gone through that

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
process we understand well actually

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
we're not that innovative or we don't

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,279
have a strong ideation model

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,160
in in our in our technology

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,760
teams even if we did we don't actually

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,839
have the capability to technical

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
capability to bring those to market fast

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,320
enough

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,920
or effectively and we feel that

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,360
either we need to add new people we

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
don't have the right people or we need

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
to upskill the current people's

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,800
resources so these are the

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,959
three underlying issues that i've

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,199
identified for this particular exercise

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
here

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,040
and it's obviously very important at

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,720
this stage you have to create

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,560
a baseline you have to know

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,760
where you are today you have to

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,519
understand

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
and we and this is actually fairly

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,440
common um

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,959
the more common than we would like is

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,040
people understand when people come to

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,160
say we have to improve our brand

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
okay great why we get to these points by

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,279
how much

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,959
in what areas across what domains with

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,600
what customer segment

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,800
so on and so forth they don't have the

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,240
answers they just know they need to

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,959
improve their brand

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
okay so it's really important that at

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
this stage

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,040
create a baseline there are lots of

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,160
models and methods to do that

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,720
uh surveys

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,360
seo a variety of different softwares

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
that'll help

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,399
help do this whatever it's important

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,839
before you go

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,839
further to understand where you are

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
today

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
so let's talk a little bit about how

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:27,199
you're going to improve

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:29,040
improve your branding

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,720
so how are you going to achieve this

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,560
well there are

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,360
four levers of open source okay

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,279
one is how you consume open source how

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,040
you ingest it how you acquire and how

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,720
you operationalize your use of open

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
source across the organization that's

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
one

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
second is how you contribute and this is

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,040
specific to how you contribute

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,880
back to existing projects

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,800
the third one is around publishing

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
that's simply about open sourcing your

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,959
own software

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,800
and the fourth is what we call embed or

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,040
using open source development

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,720
best practices inside the organization

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,560
so it's not about the technology

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,160
it's about the methods and the approach

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,240
and how open source

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,079
the model of how open source software is

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,320
actually built it's commonly referred to

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,199
as

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,199
inner source today

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,920
so let's go through a little bit of an

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,519
exercise here because we want to start

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,800
breaking this down a little bit

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,880
a little bit further so

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,360
let's let's let's see if we can apply

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,759
the levers of open source to the core

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,160
underlying issues that we have

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,880
uh that we've identified around helping

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,480
drive

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,600
brand uh enhancement so when let's talk

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,639
about

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,880
for innovation does consuming software

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,480
drive innovation inside an organization

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,399
yes it does a little bit

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
uh sometimes most or many times

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,759
organizations are simply just consumers

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,040
of a packaged or community open source

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,480
and so

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,560
mild effect does it help uh drive

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
technology improvement or enhancement it

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,319
certainly can

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,880
you know it doesn't doesn't mean you

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,319
know adopting the the latest

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,919
relational data open source relational

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,799
database is really going to make you

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,720
innovative

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,559
but if you adopt enough open source

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,079
new innovative modern open source

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,559
technologies your

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
overall organization will become more

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,000
technologically

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,520
competent we'll say right and does

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,720
consuming open source really

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
uh help drive the the growth of the

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,039
people category here

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,799
it again it can but may not have as

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,080
as large an impact if you're just pure

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,960
consumers

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
so if you contribute to existing

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,880
projects

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,320
does that help drive innovation it can

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,440
uh it may be more tactical contributions

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,480
than than really innovative so

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,760
yes no can it help improve the

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,520
technology in the organization

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
absolutely if you're contributing back

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,799
to existing projects

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
it typically means that you have

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,000
developers or contributors who are

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,360
pretty well versed in these technologies

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,679
and that this can really help

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,640
again uplift your own technology

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,799
category here

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,400
and can it help drive some of the people

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
goals you may have tied to brand

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,880
enhancement

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,720
absolutely then we come to publishing

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,160
you can see that's fairly strong across

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
all the categories obviously

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,080
if you open source some of your own

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,400
software you're hoping it's innovative

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,919
may not always be but there should be

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
there's probably some very good reason

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,440
for open sourcing it

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,360
uh and that generally innovation is a

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,200
component of that

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,280
uh from a technology perspective

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,160
absolutely publishing your own software

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,000
as as open source in our observation

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,559
typically means that the organization

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,799
is beginning to overall increase their

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,440
technology capabilities

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,960
and certainly it can enhance some of

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
these

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
the the people uh the people category

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,960
here because your people have to be

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,640
domain

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
they they have to be technology experts

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
they have to be domain experts they have

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
to be

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
open source experts so now you're really

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,200
beginning to to

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,080
reach some of those brand enhancement

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,120
goals that you want to

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,760
so last category is embedding or inner

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
source

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,640
uh yes it can happen this it really does

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,679
help drive innovation as your

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,720
organization becomes

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,919
more collaborative internally we have

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,039
absolutely seen this result in increased

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
innovation not just

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,720
actual innovation but pace of innovation

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
so certainly can help achieve those

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,679
goals

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,200
from a technology perspective it's a

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
little bit less about the technology

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,840
than it

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
is about organizational cultural

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,120
transformation so

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,559
a little bit less there but again it

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,760
will have an impact on

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,440
how your people can help

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,039
drive some of these brand enhancement

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,960
goals so this is

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,799
one way to to look at the how the levers

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
of open source

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,799
can meet the can can address some of the

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
underlying issues

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,559
of your overall goal which in this case

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,559
is brand or reputational enhancement

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,559
so one more one more exercise to go

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,320
through

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,240
but now we we have this we have a

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,760
premise at this point we're going to

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,240
kind of test our

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,320
the premise a little bit so now we can

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
say by contributing to existing open

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,480
source software projects

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
publishing your own software as open

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,400
source or embracing

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,159
inner source you can address some of

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,159
your brand image and reputational

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
goals

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,679
so this part begins to get much more

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,640
specific to each and every individual

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,039
organization so what i mean by that is

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
let's

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,919
look at what each of these

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
the pros and cons of each of these

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,880
different open source

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,520
levers right so contributing

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,600
well if you want there are lots and lots

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,679
of projects out there that you're

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,360
that your people can contribute to it's

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
typically less expensive than some of

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,120
the other methods to do so

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,840
and you likely have more internal

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,039
resources who can actually contribute

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,039
to exist existing open source projects

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,480
the con is in this instance it's really

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,760
hard to stand out i mean just look at

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
let's just take the

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,559
cncf the the foundation where kubernetes

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,080
resides and the whole kind of kubernetes

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,159
ecosystem

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,240
excuse me there are hundreds and

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,320
hundreds of projects in there today

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,280
there are what over 45 million projects

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,480
on on

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,840
github so it's it's not

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,880
easy to really pick the right project

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,720
and stand out in that in that project so

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
the impact is is probably going to be

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,640
lower

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,720
so let's look at it let's look at

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,280
publishing if you open sourcing your own

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
software

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,559
software obviously you're going to do

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,080
that because you believe there's a

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,039
higher impact and

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,640
typically there is um what we tend to

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
caution people is

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,240
you know no matter your who you are your

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,200
brand

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,919
your position in in the ecosystem today

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,760
uh

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,000
you're most likely to get lots and lots

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,120
of interest right after you open source

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,679
something but don't get fooled or conned

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
by that because you have to make sure

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,720
that you have

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:26,400
a really solid bulletproof plan

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,120
to keep capturing that visibility

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,960
and growing your community for at least

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,840
the next 18 to 24 months

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
24 months is what we tell people today

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,559
you have to be

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,640
the core driver of some of these

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,520
initiatives for at least a couple of

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,280
years

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
so that leads us to the cons here it can

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,000
be very expensive to open source some of

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,840
your own software

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,480
and it can take lots of internal

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,480
resources not just the developers

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,679
but legal security marketing

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,480
hr procurement and and so on so it does

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
take a

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,159
it does take a big effort to be

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
successful here it's

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
there are some good examples out there

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,400
but it does take a big effort

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,799
okay so inner source

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,080
so we know that it can help drive does

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,840
drive innovation

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,640
and it does bring about internal

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,000
cultural and organizational change

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,480
it does help an organization become a

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,280
little bit more agile

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,360
a little bit more collaborative but it

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,480
is typically hard to accomplish

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,760
and it does take a long time

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,840
because remember we're talking about the

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,960
enterprise here not a single not just

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,880
one

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,080
developer group or one line of business

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
but we're talking about an enterprise

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,679
so to to really promote this across the

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:46,559
enterprise it does take a bit of time

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:49,360
okay so um

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
this is an approach or a model you want

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,120
to just

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,919
keep taking the overall goal that you've

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,279
identified

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,440
again it could be as opposed to brandish

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,640
brand enhancement it could be reducing

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,159
costs

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,679
or driving more innovation as the as the

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,240
higher level goals but you can

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,120
the idea here is to apply this approach

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,000
to break it

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,400
each step down a little bit more into

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,720
its constituent parts until you get here

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,520
and then again this this is where you

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,799
begin to

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,200
apply very specifically your own

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,400
organization's characteristics or

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,960
capabilities

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
some organizations have you know more

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,240
developers they can apply to these

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
efforts they may have more budget some

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,039
have

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,240
have less some are already are down this

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,240
this organizational cultural

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,880
transformation path so it's a little bit

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,360
easier

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,360
to say drive inner source more

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,279
enterprise wide

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,200
and so this is where you really have to

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,520
apply your own context

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,520
to this particular approach and model

00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,159
so want to wrap up

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,600
with just a few tips uh that that

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,279
uh i've um

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,520
have generated through the the work i've

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,039
done over the years uh

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,919
and these are really really ones that

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,120
are

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,559
important to the success of

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,520
open source across the enterprise okay

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,279
so please take these these with a degree

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,480
of seriousness so

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,080
engage the right stakeholders early on

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,200
in the process

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,880
at all levels so

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
understand it's important to actually

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,760
understand who

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,760
am i going to need to not only

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,640
get this plan done get the resources to

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
uh

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
to get signed off on this plan to get

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,960
the resources to execute this plan

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,080
to get the resources to actually uh

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,640
support

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,039
uh the the outcome of this strategy

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,679
and think about you know the functional

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,600
groups also hr procurement legal so on

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,039
uh and get them engaged early in the

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,720
process

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,679
really really important all right

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,240
engage everyone in the community itself

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
this may

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,480
seem a bit uh a bit counter intuitive

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,480
for some of what we call the functional

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,520
operational group such again as hr legal

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,440
procurement

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,679
um but it's important to get them

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
engaged and the ways to do that are

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,640
obviously get them involved in the in

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
the planning process

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,960
have them experience the community have

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,760
them participate on it on

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,559
events like this have them um

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,679
participate

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,360
in users groups uh there are even

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,039
whether there are a whole bunch of users

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,039
groups are out there that aren't just

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,840
developer oriented there are some that

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,240
there's a legal open source community

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,279
there is a community loosely tied to

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,240
procurement

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,600
and security but try and get everyone

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,440
engaged in the process

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,760
it really helps smooth the

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,279
decision-making

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,559
process here and very very importantly

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,559
don't skimp on governance governance

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,559
you know my definition of governance is

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,000
simply the open source lifecycle

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,360
component management

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,200
which includes again how you ingest

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,720
you know policies and processes and

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,440
automation and tooling

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,720
that help manage open source from how

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,039
it's ingested and

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,120
acquired how it's governed so how are

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,360
you validating security issues

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,080
how are you validating licensing and ip

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,600
potential issues or conflicts

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,600
how are you managing

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,919
a version proliferation how are you

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,440
managing production support

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,559
and so on address this early in the

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,760
process

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,960
it's you know no one wants to do

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,720
governance you do

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,120
governance because you want to get at

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
the actual benefits of open source

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
right cost reduction innovation whatever

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,399
the case is

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,080
but it's really important to have a

00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,000
sound foundation here

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,000
can't stress this enough

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,000
most enterprises are using five

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,720
ten thousand or more open source

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,480
components

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,799
and you can't manage that effectively

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,399
without without automation and without

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,960
policies and processes

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,480
so please if anything pay attention to

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,440
that piece get that right

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840
as early in this process as possible and

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,080
then

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,120
i like to say you know tell yourself or

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,760
recognize

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,320
that this is hard but it will be worth

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,039
it and tell yourself that as many times

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
as you need to

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
so thank you for for joining me today i

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,640
am happy to answer

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,880
questions just yet but we'll

stay on a few more minutes and see what

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,399
comes in okay

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,840
all right

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,480
okay well um hopefully

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,000
the fact that there are no questions

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,679
means that this was

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,760
a very simple and straightforward

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,320
process something that you'll be able to

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,120
to apply as you go through your own uh

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,320
planning

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,640
exercises here i'll be on the the
