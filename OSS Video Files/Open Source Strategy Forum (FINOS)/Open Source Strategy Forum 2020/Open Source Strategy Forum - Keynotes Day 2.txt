excited to kick off day two

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
so just before we get started a few

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,000
quick reminders

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,039
we welcome and encourage you to engage

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
with the community

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
we've had some great lively

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,399
conversations over the slack channels

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
and and there you can chat with other

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,160
attendees and presenters on really a

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
wide range of topics

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,079
maybe related to open source and finance

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,080
or maybe related to your pets

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,840
or food and really anything that helps

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
engage you with the community

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
and and we want to keep this

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
conversation going so the slack channels

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
will stay open for a while you can carry

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,920

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
let's kick off with today's keynote um

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,680
yesterday

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
gab spoke briefly about the noteworthy

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,000
progress that our financial services

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
community

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,040
has made in adopting open source and the

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
value it brings

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,959
to all participants both on the

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
technical and and business side

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
and today i'm going to focus a little

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,680
more on how the finance industry can

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
build on that

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
and tackle some big challenges and by

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
way of introduction

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,040
i'm tasha ellison the chief operating

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,879
officer at thanos

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,720
so this morning we issued a press

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,640
release announcing that two new projects

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,640
have been contributed to the foundation

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,319
and that we've kicked off an important

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
new initiative

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,480
so the first uh the symphony java

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
toolkit has been contributed by deutsche

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
bank

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
and as adoption of symphony grows this

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
is an ideal time

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
to collaborate on tools that address

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
common concerns and workflows

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
and this suite of libraries really does

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
just that you know it's been used in

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
production

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,879
at deutsche bank and it focuses on

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,879
delivering client functionality

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,519
things like request for quote building

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,519
orders sharing acts information

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,040
and these are useful utilities that

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
should be developed once

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
collaboratively not multiple times

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,720
across multiple firms

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,239
you know doing it once that means you

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
have more time to focus on

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
the price that's actually in that rfq or

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
the customer order

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
for your client really the value add for

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,400
your firm

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
and if you didn't catch yesterday's talk

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,519
um

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
it's worth watching the replay to learn

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
more

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
we also announced that openmama has

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
joined finos

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
now openmomma is a vendor-neutral

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,480
cross-platform api

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,080
that interfaces with a wide variety of

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,080
message-oriented middleware systems

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
it provides a simplified way of sharing

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,959
market data across

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,720
investment banks proprietary trading

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
companies hedge funds

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
and data providers

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,160
and if you've ever done an

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
implementation of a market data feed you

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
know it can be complicated

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
and take about a lot of time so you know

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
having this common project can

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
help reduce the cost of ownership and

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
the time and the time to market

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,639
for all of the market participants now

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
openmomma was already open sourced under

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
the linux foundation

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
but when finnos moved to the linux

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,080
foundation it made sense to join

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
together where we can jointly benefit

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,759
from the alignment

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,759
of our members and community

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
so where is this taking us you know

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,360
we're excited about these contributions

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,199
and they really highlight

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
part of what has been a great year for

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
us you know as gab and dove mentioned

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,280
yesterday

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
we've had a record number of

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,840
contributions from banks and this is a

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,320
strong indicator that financial services

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
is more fully embracing open source you

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,080
know with this growing community and

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
ecosystem and this greater comfort with

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
open source practices

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
the finance industry is in prime

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,160
position to collaborate on

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,759
bigger opportunities and innovate the

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,639
open source way

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
and you know one of the opportunities we

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,199
see

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,759
is in regtech

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,280
you know we think that there's that open

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,039
source software and standards

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,800
can really change the way that financial

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
regulation is interpreted

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
implemented and supervised and and

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
that's why we started the open reg tech

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
initiative

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
really to explore and promote

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
opportunities for collaboration between

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
financial financial institutions

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
technology firms

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,320
service providers and regulators

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,520
um i co-lead this initiative for venice

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,479
alongside my con

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,280
my colleague itana miyal and we're

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,199
thrilled

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,400
with the interested interests that we've

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,000
had so far

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,479
from all of these different market

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
participants you know and as a result of

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
that interest

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
our board has a crew approved the

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,360
creation of a special interest group

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
focused on this topic now before i get

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
into the

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
a bit more about the special interest

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,440
group i want to give you

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
a little bit of a sense for just how big

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
of a challenge this is

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
and why it's important you know there

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
are a very large number of financial

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
regulators across the globe

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,680
and many financial institutions provide

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
services

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
in a large number of markets and so they

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,600
need to address the requirements

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
for those many different regulators and

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
those regulators might all have

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
different models or different approaches

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,039
to how they deliver and want to receive

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,360
information related to the regulations

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,039
you know and these regulations can be

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
very lengthy and dense

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,880
for example dodd-frank's regulatory

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,160
definition of swaps

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,400
just swabs is 160 pages long

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
you know these many millions of pages of

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,919
regulation

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
ultimately result in the production of

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,840
billions of data points

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,440
former bank of england governor mark

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,759
carney said last year

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
that the bank can receive 65 billion

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
data points

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
in a single year and there's a reason

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,000
for this

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,759
you know financial services is an

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,080
extremely complex

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,160
and often nuanced industry covering a

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
huge range of products and services

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
delivered to hundreds of millions in in

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,039
some cases billions

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
of people and

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,639
as you can imagine with this level of

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,400
complexity

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,560
and scale there's a cost you know

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,240
it's it's costly it's expensive to

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,479
interpret those regulations

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,120
one report showed that bank compliance

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,360
costs jumped more than 50 billion

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
dollars a year after dodd-frank and

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
that's before you even get to the

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,240
implementation

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
and for each of the regulated entities

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
who has to implement those regulations

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
there's a technology cost you know a

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
systems cost uh lexus nexus recently

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
estimated that

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,680
40 of financial crime compliance costs

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,639
are associated with technology

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,599
and then there's the the expense of

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,599
making

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,440
understanding what all of that data is

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,000
telling us

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,919
you know but with all of this it's

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,319
important that we get regulation

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,240
and compliance right because if we can

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,080
get it if we get it wrong

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,199
there can be disastrous effects

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,039
so with that as a backdrop i'd like to

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,680
tell you about our regulation innovation

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,680
sig

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,800
which we announced this morning this is

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,800
being led by air

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,919
the alliance for innovative regulation

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,680
and ing

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,440
in fact you can chat with the sig leads

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,320
ian hollabrad and david eric

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
in our ask the expert session uh just

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,200
after

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
during the break just after this the

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
keynotes today

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
um and the goal here is to bring

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,519
together individuals who are interested

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,240
in creating open source solutions

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,839
for regulatory and compliance issues and

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
we provide a neutral

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,920
trusted environment to explore the

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
challenges identify opportunities

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,120
and ultimately build open source

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,080
projects standards

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,080
tools models documentation reference and

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
reference implementations

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
really anything that is open but

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
governed that can help

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
you know and we recognize that it's

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
important to have representatives

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
and insight from all of the different

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
participants in the industry

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,519
so from financial institutions we need

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,720
compliance professionals and architects

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,720
and engineers

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
and we need regulators at the table too

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
and you know there's some

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,880
great innovative regulators the fca the

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,000
bank of england finra cfpb

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,160
you can hear from later as well and the

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
tech and advisor community has a huge

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
role to play

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,279
also and we need the regtex consultants

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,040
other foundations associations

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,839
we all need to come together to figure

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,480
out how we can solve these industry

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,519
challenges

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,440
we had of the first the sig had its

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,760
first meeting earlier this week and

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,920
two items that came up repeatedly were

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,440
standards and interoperability

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,200
and we discussed a number of different

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,920
potential focus areas

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,640
digital regulatory digital regulatory

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
reporting

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,079
aml horizon scanning payments

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
and these discussions often came back to

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,160
the importance of

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,880
standards and interop and this really

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,800
underpinning

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,640
the ability to be successful in making

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
change you know so we had a great

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,519
initial conversation we have

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,519
lots of directions for future

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
conversations and you know we're really

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,680
looking forward to finding some exciting

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,959
projects to work on together

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
if you want to you can learn more about

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,720
the sig and find out how to get involved

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,440
on our website

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,680
or on our github repo at finos

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
github.com

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,680
finnosopenregtech

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,839
and so

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,880
we know that this is an in an easy

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
industry challenge to solve

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
it's hard it's going to take time and

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,560
effort of many individuals

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,440
and many groups but open source

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,560
in all of its variations must have a

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
prominent role

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,560
in how we make it faster better and

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,839
easier

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,480
to produce interpret

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,320
comply with and supervise financial

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
regulation

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
now this is just one of the big issues

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
we think open source can help

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,880
solve for the industry but we do think

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:31,839
it's an important one

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,160
so with that i'll wrap up you know we we

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
have many more projects and initiatives

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,760
and there are lots of ways that you can

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
get involved um you know whether that's

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,880
coding or providing insight

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,880
so many different opportunities so

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,560
please do reach out you can reach us on

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,800
slack via email

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,480
um lots of different ways and there are

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,240
a number of sessions today that touch on

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,399
different angles of regulation

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
and also a number of other topics so

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,880
we're

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,480
pretty excited about our lineup today

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,120
including our fantastic

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,880
keynotes and with that i'd like to

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,000
introduce our first speaker today

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,639
chris ferris chris is an ibm fellow and

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,680
cto

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,040
of open technology for ibm and he's been

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
involved in the architecture

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,240
design and engineering of distributed

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
systems

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,279
for most of his 40-plus year career in

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,279
it

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,440
and he's been actively engaged in open

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,800
standards and open source development

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,560
since 1999. today chris will talk about

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
the importance of securing the open

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
source supply chain

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:39,600
so please well help please welcome

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:42,320
chris ferris

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,800
hi my name is chris ferris i'm an ibm

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,560
fellow and cto for open tech

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,880
and i'd like to talk this morning about

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
securing the open source supply chain

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,399
so i think we can all agree that it's

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,519
really critical that you secure the

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
software that you deploy in your

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,040
enterprise i don't know

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,880
anybody disagrees with that particular

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,040
point what i'm talking about though this

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,639
morning is securing the supply chain

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,200
where did all of the open source

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
dependencies that comprise the projects

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
that you're deploying whether it's

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,880
kubernetes or

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,560
tensorflow or pi torch or what have you

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
where did all of that come from who was

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,800
developing and so forth

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,240
open source is the foundation for almost

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
everything that we do

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,600
in software these days and when you

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
think about it

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
open source projects can have tens

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,200
hundreds even thousands

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,760
of dependencies upon which they're built

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
and the the sheer reality is that not

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,959
all open source software is constructed

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,800
equally

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,040
it's really fundamentally important that

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,160
you understand where did the software

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,160
come from what team was developing it do

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,959
they have security engineering practices

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,639
in mind

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,160
are they developing it in the community

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
that's going to quickly address any

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,839
vulnerabilities that might be discovered

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,760
you don't want to be in a situation

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,600
where basically you have all of this

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
infrastructure deployed on the

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
right-hand side of the screen there and

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
then this one little tiny dependency

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,720
that's involved by one guy in nebraska

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,040
who gets hit by a bus

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
and nobody understands or under or has

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,000
uh is even paying attention to

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
and it fails in some way and brings the

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
whole house of cards tumbling down

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
i don't want to get anybody alarmed this

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
isn't really you know something that's

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,199
that we have to be fundamentally

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,519
concerned about and stop

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,360
using open source that's not my point

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,560
here my point is that we really do need

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,519
to focus on

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
how do we improve the process for

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,040
developing software

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,360
with these open source dependencies

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,560
ensuring that indeed they're going to be

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,920
secure as we deploy them so last fall

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
there were a number of different threads

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,519
that

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,040
sort of started up each sharing a common

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,959
mission we were trying to figure out how

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
do we improve the security of the open

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
source

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,519
software pipeline so the linux

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
foundation had been working on a project

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,399
called the core infrastructure

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
initiative some of you may be familiar

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,279
with

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,959
but it had come to an end in the

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,320
previous year and

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
jim zemlin and others at the lynx

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,079
foundation are trying to figure out what

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,240
do we do

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,920
with the core infrastructure initiative

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,160
its assets and so forth we

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
we need to sort of continue that program

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,040
but in a different

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,760
form factor github had gathered together

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,079
a number of partners including owasp and

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,399
jp morgan microsoft google

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,680
ncc group and a number of others and

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,360
they formed something called the open

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,760
source security coalition

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
and their mission was basically similar

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,880
it was to figure out

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,839
how do we improve the process of

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,199
developing open source software

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,800
to ensure that it's delivering securely

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,399
and then finally there was another group

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,199
pulled together by google

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,560
ibm microsoft github red hat intel and

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,800
the linux foundation

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,680
again focus on just about the same sort

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
of things

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
but we were doing this all independently

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
and we sort of found out about each

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
other

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
you know through our our co-mingled

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
members here

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,720
and we decided that it would be

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
important that we sort of pull all these

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
things

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,720
all these different threads together and

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,040
launch a single initiative

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
and that's where we have launched uh as

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,079
as of august the beginning of august we

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,279
launched the open source security

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,199
foundation

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
um it's been three months now since

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,839
we've launched and we've

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
accomplished quite a bit and i'll i'll

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,240
talk about that in a moment

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,720
we're currently member there's currently

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,600
35 different member organizations

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
of openssf and there are about 110

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
individuals that are collaborating on

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
the various working groups

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,360
and technical committees um as you can

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,480
see from the the membership it's pretty

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,880
diverse set of uh members it's not just

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,079
uh software vendors it's not just

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
hardware vendors

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
but you know consumers of technology as

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,079
well

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,639
um and and again we're growing pretty

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,240
quickly

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
again this is all during the pandemic

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
and so forth so this is a function of

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
getting the word out and i would

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
encourage

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,279
uh you it you know to to think about um

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,800
participating in the activities if not

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
becoming a member it doesn't actually

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
cost anything

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,600
to be a member this year um because of

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
the pandemic we figured

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
look let's just launch this let's let's

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,439
make the membership

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,079
free to all um and let's just grow this

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,760
and see what we can do with it

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,679
and we in fact are getting some things

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
done that's the important aspect of this

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
isn't it

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,160
um we've launched six different uh

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,919
technical working groups to

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,520
you know think about you know various

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,039
aspects of securing the open source

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,760
security pipeline

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,280
um identifying security threats what are

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,199
the means by which

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,679
open source can be kind of become

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,200
compromised um so identifying where

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,480
those security threats are is really a

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
fundamental piece

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,840
security tooling how do we scan and fuzz

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,760
test

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,039
our open source software as it's being

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,559
developed

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
and how do we scan images that we're

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
deploying into our enterprise let's

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,919
improve those

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,360
tools and let's make them available as

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,240
open source

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,120
where we can um the best practices is

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
now sort of

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
brought into itself the the work that

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,039
was ongoing in the core infrastructure

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,120
initiative

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,400
to improve and publish a set of security

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,880
best practices for

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
secure engineering and so forth the

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
vulnerability disclosures group is

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
looking at

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
efficient vulnerability reporting and

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,000
remediation

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
we've got a digital identity group

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,440
that's looking at how do we ensure the

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
providence of open source code how do

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
you know

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
that you're using the source code that

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,919
was actually published by

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
the kubernetes community for instance

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
and then securing critical projects this

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,200
is really sort of taking

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,039
the work that was done in the core

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
infrastructure initiative to

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,160
take a look at what are the most

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,400
critical projects to be

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,440
to be focused on again we can't do all

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
of them

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,679
but we can maybe look at the top 10 or

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,440
20 projects the ones that are most

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,960
heavily used the ones that

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,720
you know if there were a security

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,240
vulnerability would be the most

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,679
important to focus on

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
and we're looking at how can we help

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,080
those communities improve their

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,240
secure engineering practices incorporate

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,160
scanning and fuzzing in the production

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
of the software and so forth

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,520
and then finally we have a technical

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
advisory council that's looking across

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,360
all of the different initiatives and

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,280
will be incubating others as they come

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
along

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,960
to you know sort of keep everything sort

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,919
of uh

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,360
coherent if you will um in in terms of

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,000
uh from a technical

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,679
technical perspective we've accomplished

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,280
quite a bit in the first three months we

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,440
have six working groups as i

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,720
mentioned and a technical advisory

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
council all

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
up and running we published a couple of

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
different press releases including one

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,039
last week

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,120
we had our first town hall meeting just

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,240
a couple of days ago um the recording

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,679
will be out on

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,160
the internet soon um we've had added 16

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,000
new member organizations and we have

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
uh five new governing board members that

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,799
we've added uh to the mix

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,640
we published our our first edx course on

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,080
uh secure engineering practices i'll

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
talk about that in a second

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,240
and we've as i mentioned a couple of

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
times we've started to consolidate

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,360
some of the output of the core

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,240
infrastructure initiative and then

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,400
finally there's a

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,960
a cool store where you can buy cool swag

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,640
with the open ssf goose

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,799
uh on on the front label um

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,480
i mentioned the edx course um this is

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,559
something that's free

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,400
uh to anybody if you want to have the

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,320
certificate you'll have to pay

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,760
but it's free for anybody to take and i

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
think this is you know

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,559
a really a great opportunity to learn

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,039
more about secure engineering practices

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,760
we're pretty proud of this course and as

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,840
i mentioned

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
we've been working to consolidate the

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,480
output of

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,000
the core infrastructure initiative

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,280
including the survey of

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
uh critical projects um uh another

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,640
census

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
that was done uh as a function of okay

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,120
so

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,200
of those projects which ones are most

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,000
important to have follow-on work

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,799
and then uh we had a program called the

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
cii

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,000
best practices badging program where you

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,280
could basically

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,919
have a scan of your project to see based

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,640
on the the the repositories that you're

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,640
using

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
are you following secure engineering

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,679
practices

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,760
and then you can get a badge to indicate

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,679
that indeed you are

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,520
and again this is something that we're

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,960
going to be continuing to work on as we

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
go forward

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
i would encourage you to get involved

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,840
again as i mentioned it's free to join

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,640
um and we'd love to have new members

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,559
both

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,640
from a organizational perspective and

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,320
but also in terms of the working groups

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
and committees that we have

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,919
launched to date um there's mailing

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,120
lists meetings are

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,080
all online and open to anyone to join uh

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,360
we have slack we have twitter feed

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,200
um come on down it's really um it's

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
starting to really take off and we would

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,600
encourage

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
everybody to come in because as as we

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,880
all know this is really critically

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,480
important and nobody's going to secure

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,360
it for us we all have to

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
pitch in and help to secure the software

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,400
they're deploying

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,840
so thank you very much i appreciate your

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
time take care

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,960
now i'd like to introduce our next two

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
speakers joanne barefoot and matthew van

buskirk

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,200
who will be discussing the future of

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,640
financial regulation

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,280
and matt is the co-founder and ceo

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
fighting financial crime

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,600
and they're doing this by reducing

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
paperwork providing smart

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,880

and co-founder of the alliance for

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,960
innovative regulation or

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,120
air we are a non-profit dedicated to

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,159
digitizing the financial regulatory

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
world

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,120
and i'm happy to be joined in this

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,640
fireside chat with matt van buskirk

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:50,559
the co-ceo of hummingbird who is also

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,200
an advisor to us at air on technology in

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,080
general

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,720
and especially on open source so matt

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,039
welcome to this conversation

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,760
looking forward to it we are going to

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
make it a

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,440
two-way conversation we actually talk

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,279
about these issues all the time so we're

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,520
just going to have that conversation to

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,840
share with the group today

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,960
so when we think about bringing open

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,559
source to the financial regulatory space

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,440
a lot is at stake the financial system

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,880
is the circulatory system of the economy

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
if it doesn't work well

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,480
bad things happen if it works really

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,400
well some

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,320
really good things can happen in today's

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
technology world that weren't possible

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,159
in the

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,360
in the past but if we're not careful

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,200
uh the regulatory aspect of this since

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
it's such a highly regulated

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
set

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
it'll choke off good innovation that we

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,480
would all like to see

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,880
accidentally and it will also

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,640
potentially allow new risks to come into

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,279
the system

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,960
and the regulatory system needs new

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,880
tools for the digital age and the

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,840
pandemic in particular

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,919
has really uh accelerated the

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,200
recognition of that and the readiness to

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
adopt it

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,039
so matt let me start by asking you where

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,559
does open source

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,559
fit into that challenge

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,960
i like to draw parallels to the uh tech

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,919
world when we're thinking about

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,240
where the regulatory situation is today

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,279
and

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,080
where we would like it to go uh it's

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
basically

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,480
like the tech world was back in the

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,240
1990s with a bunch of different

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
uh providers sort of building their own

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
closed ecosystems

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,880
whether that's the microsoft versus

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
apple

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,000
comparison or the sort of fragmentation

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,279
we saw in the internet space with aol

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,360
and compuserve and all these other

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,400
solutions that didn't really

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,240
speak with each other at all

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
that's basically where we are today in

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
the regulatory world from a technology

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,640
perspective

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,799
and in some cases the technology that's

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,000
being used actually does come from the

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,760
1990s kind of vintage maybe even older

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,480
in some cases

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,480
so the revolution we've seen in the

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,600
software space moving towards more

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
interoperability

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,799
more reliance on shared protocols and

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,400
standards

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,480
more open source code bases

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
is non-existent really in the regulatory

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,600
world and

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,080
they're i think it presents a

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,440
major challenge to innovation widely in

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,039
financial services

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,039
as we've seen sort of fintech expand and

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,159
the banking industry tried to adopt more

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,400
and sophisticated technology

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,240
we're still regulating using the same

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,200
approaches and tools that we did

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,400
20 years ago and it's going to continue

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,279
to

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,919
it'll become a bigger and bigger anchor

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,799
weighing down

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,720
innovation unless we can move to a new

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,279
footing

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,080
using the some same themes i was just

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,200
talking about

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,400
in the regulatory space as well so we

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
could really

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
unlock innovation to a degree that we

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
have not seen before

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
if we can start to think about

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,279
regulation

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,120
as more of a open source software

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,640
challenge as opposed to

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,799
sort of lawyers and papers and

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,520
spreadsheets yeah

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,520
and this thinking is quite new in the

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,679
regulatory space we do have some

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
financial regulatory agencies that are

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,200
using

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,480
open source techniques the in the united

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,640
states the financial

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,480
uh or in the uk the financial conduct

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,399
authority has done this in the united

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,679
states the consumer financial protection

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,559
bureau

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,080
has open sourced some of its work but

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,120
regulators still

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,880
tend to react to the thought of open

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,600
source as sounding

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
insecure and risky so there's a lot of

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
education

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,080
and part of what we're trying to do

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,799
today is to offer a

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,960
issue a call to action uh for the people

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,480
in this virtual room to do more

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
but they're tremendous potential

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,799
benefits to regulators

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,720
and some of them are just what this

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,520
audience already knows about open source

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
but

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,760
part of it is uh that regulators today

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,679
reinvent the wheel

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,000
every time they need to develop

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,240
something and we could tell you horror

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,399
stories about agencies spending

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,200
tens of millions of dollars to create

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,440
some new

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
platform for doing their work that type

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,200
of thing

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
completely inside their own silo when

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
there's maybe

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,000
already a better one at a sister agency

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,600
that they don't even know about

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,080
so you could get beyond reinventing the

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,480
wheel you could get the benefit

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,080
of regulators being able to build on

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,520
each other's work

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,480
you could get the benefit of scrutiny

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,559
from the open source community on these

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,600
tools to find the

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,600
the bugs and the weaknesses and the

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,279
vulnerable spots in them and get those

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,360
fixed quickly

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,000
you can get the ability to constantly

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,360
uh improve can continuously update and

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,520
build these tools out

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,120
much of the financial system and

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,559
certainly the financial regulatory

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,679
system is

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,600
is half paralyzed with rigid old

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,039
technologies as you said

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,360
that are really hard to update um

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,039
and you can also build interoperability

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
of the regulatory system which

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,279
would foster in interoperability of the

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,080
financial system which would be very

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,240
beneficial especially to international

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,480
financial organizations

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,640
and you can also get the benefit of

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,480
regulatory agencies being able

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,399
and to some extent to get away from

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,279
their procurement

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,360
processes for technology which are very

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,039
cumbersome and difficult

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,799
um and inflexible and let them start to

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,720
be able to build tools

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:51,440
just by finding the open source um

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,559
material for it and and be able to move

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,159
in a much more

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,039
adaptable way so

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
toward that end one of the exciting

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,120
things that

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,720
i want to talk about today is that we

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,840
at air are partnering with venos

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,399
and creating a special interest group a

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,919
sig

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,039
on reg tech in the um

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,360
in the linux ecosystem we want to invite

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,720
all of you to join in that we're just at

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,360
the very start of it i think it's going

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,080
to be a very exciting opportunity

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,440
but matt let me ask you what you think

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,840
are the obstacles

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,559
to being able to bring open source

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,399
approaches

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:37,200
into the financial regulatory space

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,760
i touched on some on the regulatory side

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
the

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
existing procurement processes are one

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,000
of the biggest barriers

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,880
one of the agencies that we've met with

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,679
in the past

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,000
which i will not name said that if they

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,440
wanted to get their hands on the new uh

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
piece of technology it would probably

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,799
take them seven years from

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,399
taking the process off to when they

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,519
would actually have it deployed i

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,279
remember that meeting

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,240
yeah we think about how uh it would be

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,760
no good anyway yeah yeah it will be way

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,720
out of date

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,640
um so there are all sorts of structural

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,880
barriers that the regulators face

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,159
and another challenge is that since

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,480
they're typically forced to go through

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,080
normal procurement processes

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,519
the companies that are often the best at

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,480
navigating procurement

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,960
uh the procurement world and government

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,880
are

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,360
rarely the ones that are the most

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,640
cutting edge on technology

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,240
so there have been multiple instances

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,600
we've seen in the past where a

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,080
contractor gets steel

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,519
deploys technology and it's already many

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,000
years out of date by the time it's

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,000
deployed

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,799
and probably cost five or ten times more

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,360
than it would need to if they had taken

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,200
a more open source development

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,960
model so there are a variety of

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,559
legal structural impediments that the

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,679
regulators face

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,440
the air the alliance regulation and the

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,919
buckley law firm

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,480
released a memo or report earlier this

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,200
year

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,320
which was analyzing several of those

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,159
barriers

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,000
which if adjusted slightly could enable

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,600
the regulators to adopt this approach

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,640
more readily but another i think is

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
a challenge they face is that the

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,960
regulatory agencies themselves are

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,679
used to needing to be authoritative and

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,200
fully understanding of all the risks and

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,120
opportunities presented by something

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,120
before they come out in

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,799
uh make their view publicly known

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,240
and that typically involves them sitting

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,640
back for two or three years

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,240
and studying something but they don't

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,480
have the in-house expertise

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,360
to understand this technology for the

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,559
most part

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,159
with some notable exceptions

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,799
and they don't the process inherently

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,120
doesn't lend itself to staying on top of

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,320
things as they evolve

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,440
so the lack of exposure and

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,039
uh lack of in-house expertise or at

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
least enough in-house expertise is one

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,600
of the biggest barriers

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,840
and i think that's one of the largest

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,880
opportunities presented by

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,120
the open source community here

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,480
i think one major learning i've had as a

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,519
i'm a former regulator

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,000
uh but a techie at heart

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,279
uh there are not too many people in the

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,640
regulatory world have a full

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,240
understanding of what

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,000
uh the cutting edge capabilities in the

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,039
tech world are

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,960
and if you go to a technologist and

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,640
tell them about or speak about the

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,799
regulatory world they probably would be

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,159
falling asleep immediately

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,080
without realizing that there are some

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,080
very meaningful and

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,840
impactful challenges that could

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,159
really benefit from bringing their

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,200
talents to bear

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
so we really need to be able to

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,960
cross-pollinate

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,240
have people understand regulation

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,919
getting in the same room with people

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,000
understand the technology and start to

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,880
develop

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,399
common approaches to things and i

00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,679
strongly believe the most effective way

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,960
to do that is through

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,559
open source uh development mechanisms

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
and putting projects out on github for

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,639
people to contribute to

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,320
and start to build a community that can

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,760
brainstorm solutions to these very

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,760
meaningful challenges that we face

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,240
go ahead go ahead oh good so there will

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,639
be

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,320
areas where certainly regulators will

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,280
need to keep their data

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,399
uh not shared although there be some

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,280
places where it'd be good

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,000
for them to share data so that for

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,960
example

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,760
companies in the industry can benchmark

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,480
themselves

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,480
against other information or trends and

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,079
that type of thing

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,520
but your view is that there's not

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,399
too much reason to fear that putting

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,839
methodologies into open source

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,520
uh will compromise them there's a lot

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,960
you do a lot of work in financial crime

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,520
at hummingbird

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,400
and there's certainly a concern raised

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,400
that if

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,520
if regulators were open sourcing their

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
techniques

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
for detecting financial crime that the

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,560
criminals would all

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,880
uh go figure out how to how to game it

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,400
what's your answer to that that's sort

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,760
of the same response to

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,200
the information security angle on

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,480
open source where there's sort of a

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,640
common uh stereotypical view that open

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,960
source means open data

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,760
and reality it's sort of the the

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,599
eyeballs

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,599
comparison question like how many people

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
are looking for vulnerabilities versus

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,800
how many

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
people are looking for uh

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,839
vulnerabilities to exploit versus how

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,359
many are looking for them to protect

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,000
against them

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,640
that holds true very significantly in

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,359
the

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,040
any money laundering world as well where

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,440
the criminal world are not

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,560
they're not hiding information from each

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,560
other there's

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,920
been the advent of a concept of crime as

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,720
a service

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,240
where people are developing tools and

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,240
finding vulnerabilities in financial

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,359
services providers

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,119
and they're often not exploiting

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,040
themselves they're building those tools

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,880
then selling them or licensing licensing

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,400
them to other criminal

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,000
people so you have a average level of

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
sophistication these tools that keeps

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,880
getting

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,079
better and better but on the financial

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,599
industry side of

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,880
the table we're often combating

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,760
these bad actors by going to conferences

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
once a year

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,200
and learning what the latest

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,119
developments are

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,560
so best case scenario there you may

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,280
learn about a new approach

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,720
a year plus after it's been commonly

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,000
deployed

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,800
um so the there's an equivalent

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,040
challenge there where i would argue that

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,560
if we were developing capabilities and

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,240
that were much more sophisticated and

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,680
robust and

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
uh even if they were visible to the

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,240
criminal world it wouldn't be any

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,680
different than it is today

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,000
where they're freely sharing information

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,119
amongst themselves but

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,560
every financial institution in out there

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,880
regardless of whether they are

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,000
a major bank with thousands of people

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,599
doing this work

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,760
or a community bank that may only be

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,040
able to put half of a full-time person

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,520
onto it they could all

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,760
coordinate uh and defend themselves more

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,200
effectively and it would

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,280
um even the playing field significantly

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,240
so i think there's a lot of parallels to

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
there

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,480
there's there's shocking uh statistics

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,359
from the un

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,920
uh saying that the volume of money

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,000
laundering annually is

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,520
somewhere around two trillion dollars

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,119
and that we catch less than one percent

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,640
of it with the tools we have now so

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,440
we're gonna have to have better tools if

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,599
we're gonna

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,400
combat crimes for example like human

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,000
trafficking that rely on laundered money

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,200
so i know we're going to run short on

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,560
time we want to share with the audience

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,480
some

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,000
some things we want to urge you to do

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,160
because this is a revolution

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,599
that's coming it we think it may be

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,880
coming faster than people

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,640
think there's a lot of energy globally

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,320
gathering around

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,240
really transforming the financial

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,520
regulatory space

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,440
so for the the people in this room who

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,119
may be working for their

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,400
major financial company on uh

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,079
on the product side what should they do

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,680
if they want to get involved in helping

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
their company do

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,480
better on the compliance side with open

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,480
source tools

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,000
i think part of it is just educating

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,680
the getting involved with the compliance

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,480
team letting them know what

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,920
could be done compliance teams very

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,359
rarely actually have engineering

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,640
resources that they can

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,119
bring to bear on the challenges that

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,640
they face so they don't know what

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,680
could be done so

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,400
it's getting interested in your

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,680
compliance team's work uh obviously

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,440
there's sort of a stereotypical view of

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,720
compliance that they're the people

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,760
that say no to all of your good ideas

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,000
but in most cases hopefully

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,119
those it's just because they may not

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,440
understand fully

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,520
the opportunities or the risks presented

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,359
by adopting new tech

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,000
and uh investing technical effort into

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,119
your compliance function could really

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,359
unlock

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,640
a lot of potential for you to do other

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,760
things that are

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,040
consumer-facing um

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,640
so that's one piece of it i think

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,760
another would be

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,720
participating in the

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,839
the sig and with non-profits like air

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,000
and the

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,440
uh finnos that are trying to bring

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,640
collaborative efforts to bear on this

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,200
those

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,280
uh are there other issues you would

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,079
highlight

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,000
i think one thing that would be a good

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,240
practical step would be as you talk with

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,119
your compliance teams about this

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,520
uh talk with their examiners as well if

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,839
especially if you're a bank

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,440
and uh let them know that you that

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,720
you're thinking about doing some work

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,760
along these lines

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,599
and and bring them along because

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,040
matt and i are both former regulators

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,800
and we know we don't

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,000
we're not criticizing the regulators

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,160
they're they've been doing the best they

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,520
can with the technology they've had

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,000
but getting that community comfortable

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,680
with newer technology is is a learning

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
process and we need to engage in it

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,119
together

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,599
and maybe to close just to say that

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,079
working with this effort as matt said

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,119
there's a stereotype that regulatory

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,960
work is boring and uh

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,200
you know box checking and bureaucratic

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,160
and that's really not true there are

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,240
very interesting problems in this space

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,160
there are problems that nobody has

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,680
touched yet with good technology

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,640
and uh that you could really have major

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,560
impact and the good that it can do if

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,640
you want to fight

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,760
credit discrimination or you want to

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,800
fight

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,400
trafficking in children or you want to

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,000
figure out sustainable finance

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,680
because you care about climate change i

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,359
mean these are the big issues on the

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,200
regulatory agenda

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,040
and these kinds of tools are going to be

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,000
the secret to doing it

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
so we hope you'll work with the new sig

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,520
and

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,720
um and and go back to your offices

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,200
and or virtually go back and talk with

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,839
your

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,280
regulatory teams about how to bring open

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,240
source innovation

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,040
into this very important sector so thank

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,319
you matt

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,480
thanks everyone thank you

you know if you have any questions or

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,119
want to pick up the conversation

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,800
please do join the slack channel on on

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,680
regulation as well

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,680
um now it is my absolute pleasure to

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,920
announce our last keynote session

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,880
a discussion between co-author of the

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,000
creat

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,000
create react app dan abramoff and

macleod

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,520
dan is a well-known software engineer at

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,079
facebook and a remember of the react

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,240
core team

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,680
and prior to joining facebook dan

a predictable state container for

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,000
javascript applications

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,119
and and this really catapulted him to be

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040

so please welcome dan abramoff and james

00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:30,319
[Music]

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,880
macleod

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,520
hi i'm james macleod finnos director of

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,599
community

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,200
and i'd like to welcome dan abramoff

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,000
software engineer at facebook

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,240
co-author of create react app and redux

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,200
and twitter open source commentator to

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,119
the finnos open source strategy forum

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
dan it's an absolute pleasure to have

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,599
you here today to answer questions

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,680
from the finnos community but before we

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,440
start can you introduce yourself

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,000
for those who aren't familiar with the

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,040
work you do within the wider javascript

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,480
or facebook open source community

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:08,480
sure uh thank you for the introduction

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,440
so i um i guess i'm only uh i mostly

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,560
work on

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,440
react itself so react is a javascript

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,560
library for

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,079
building user interfaces um

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,160
so i i was like you used to react a lot

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,440
before i got the job at facebook and i

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,560
work on the reaccore themes so that

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,800
involves mostly uh fixing box

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,760
maintenance uh helping develop new

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,640
features writing documentation

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,359
and talking to the community which is

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,960
what i'm doing now

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,040
that's awesome so firstly what are your

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,960
thoughts on the funding of open source

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,119
projects and sustainability

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,160
would a project like react work without

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,920
the backing from facebook

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,520
yeah that's uh that that is an

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,720
interesting question um

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,839
i think there is uh

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,119
um it is definitely possible that

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,680
projects uh like work without uh like a

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,760
specific

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,040
like a single corporate i mean obviously

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,800
they do need

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,400
some sponsors right and like usually

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,680
those would be corporate

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,400
um but like i think like vue is a

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,599
uh there is a um kind of like a

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,720
competing library

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,280
called view that is uh fairly popular

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,800
and vue doesn't have a single corporate

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,200
sponsor so it's

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,480
uh it's multiple sponsors they change

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,839
over time

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,240
um so it is funded by by the community

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,160
and

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,760
the users so i think it's it's

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,040
definitely true that this model can be

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,680
successful

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,440
it's it's not very easy to like

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,760
replicate it you need a

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,440
critical mass of users so i think it

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,200
mostly works for

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,960
already established like pretty big

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,920
projects uh

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,720
but it is uh it is definitely possible

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,800
as for

00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,839
react itself i think there is a um

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:07,359
like it's hard to say like what if

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,359
like i don't know uh i think there is a

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,920
there are definitely differences in like

00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,680
how we would work

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,800
um and i think like one particular area

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,480
that i think people um

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,800
underestimate the value of uh

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,520
of like a company that is that is the

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,720
stable

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,000
that uh that that is not like a startup

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,440
like a um a stable corporate sponsor is

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,880
the ability to do long-term research

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,280
so um because for

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,000
for a lot of at least in my experience

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,040
and like i

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,400
i'm not like i don't want to offend

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,839
anyone but

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,280
uh i think it is true that when

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:56,480
uh like for smaller companies

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,880
the return on investment is uh

00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,520
like it needs to be very concrete uh

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,560
like

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,960
it's it's support it's developing like

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,560
particular features that they ask for

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,440
um and well that by itself is obvious

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,640
valuable and

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,400
that's fine um i think sometimes this

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,079
uh this comes at the expense of um

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,160
like not being able to do kind of

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,960
moonshot projects

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,720
where like you might uh whereas like a

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,440
bigger company might be able to fund

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,400
like

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,200
uh three years working on some idea that

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,680
is

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,599
um that is maybe more ambitious than the

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,520
usual and not all of them pan out

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,520
and i think that that is what i i

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,640
appreciate about facebook back in

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,960
react is that we have the ability to go

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,359
for like really big ideas even if they

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,119
take time

00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,400
so from what i understand when you're

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,240
developing redux

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,680
you had to get multiple different

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,040
sponsors in order to

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,480
keep your work going um is that true

00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,520
um so redux was

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,920
and it's kind of a uh unusual case

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,560
because

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,400
it is it was developed as a proof of

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,760
concept for a conference stop

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,319
it was not meant to be this like heavily

00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,960
used

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,720
library in production uh but people

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,240
started using it they liked it

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,839
and then for a few months uh like i i

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,240
didn't have a job at the time because

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,440
like my previous uh the company when i

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,400
where i was working it has folded um and

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,839
so i did

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,040
um i did have the community funded

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,599
for like maybe three to five months

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,200
something like this but i was primarily

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,319
focused on documentation

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,079
and uh and like examples so i was not

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,040
even coding that much

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,680
and i would say that redux hasn't really

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,319
changed

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,680
since like that was like five four or

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,880
five years ago

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,559
like it's it's a very uh it's a very

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,240
unusual library in that it doesn't

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,440
really do anything

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,960
uh and it's just like a a pattern and i

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,680
would say like even like maybe an

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,240
overused

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,240
uh pattern um but it is what it is yeah

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,680
it certainly has its competitors now and

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,040
so you've sparked some

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,280
inspiration in the rest of the open

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,359
source community with it

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,960
so um last month i actually noticed that

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,440
there are various different tweets about

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,359
um hacktoberfest and you know the value

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,119
that hacktopervest actually brings to

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,319
the open source community and the

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,800
the value of the contributions um now

00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,800
hacktoberfest has ended did the react

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,760
team actually see an uplift in bogus

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,359
contributions

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,160
or did the situation address the

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:39,200
community concerns

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,079
yeah i think it was a complete mess in

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,640
the beginning

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,800
and in part i i think like the

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,920
from what i gathered it was just like

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,720
there was a person

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,839
like a youtube uh person who like

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,640
uploaded the video

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,559
that said basically here's how you can

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,319
get like free t-shirts

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,839
and so people got carried away i don't

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,559
think like a lot of them were even

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,680
familiar

00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,760
with like open source um

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,839
so that that was a bit strange uh but

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,800
that lasted for like three or four days

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,640
and then uh i think like digital ocean

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,359
changed it to be often or something like

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,559
this

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,839
uh we did not often um and so

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,640
it's it's hard for me to say if like

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,880
aside from those early uh like noisy

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
aprs if there was like actual african

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,319
contributions

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,880
uh but that's mostly because it's just

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,319
like i'm doing a pretty bad job of

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,599
like actually checking those um

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,880
because we're like we're in a um kind of

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,440
a final stretch

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,640
of like a few multi-year projects that

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,480
we're just trying to wrap

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,520
up and get to completion and so we

00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:54,319
have intentionally de-emphasized uh

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:56,720
like looking at contributions and um

00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,000
and like communicative pull requests so

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,079
i haven't really been keeping

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,599
track and like i don't expect to you

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,720
until like

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,040
several months after now yeah because i

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,960
i suppose um the reacting which have to

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,720
label on some of the issues that they're

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,599
inviting out to the hacktoberfest

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,200
community

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,640
and so it kind of puts a bit of um

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,760
pressure on the team to

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,319
um review and then accept yeah and i

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,440
think for

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,319
especially for react's case uh it's

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,200
pretty tough

00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,800
because like it's not a new project

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,359
there aren't many

00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,040
uh linear like simple bugs you can just

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,240
go ahead and fix

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,200
um so it's like

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,839
there are issues we do want to work out

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,960
but they

00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,960
require like multiple months of

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,400
like just gaining context on like what

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,599
the problem is

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,480
so it's not particularly like amenable

00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,680
to

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,440
uh just like drive by contributions

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,280
uh whereas and i think like that's

00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,200
that's fine i think like a lot of people

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,200
who think about oh like i want to

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,040
contribute the open source

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,760
like they think about big projects but

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,760
it's really like i would encourage to go

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,240
beyond them and instead just like

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,319
fix something that you use it's often

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,599
like small components small libraries

00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,800
that would appreciate

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,440
the uh you know like the actual like bug

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,079
fixes

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,680
and like there's plenty like

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,480
opportunities for like performance

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,000
improvements and stuff um

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,119
so i would say just focus on the uh

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,920
you know on the uh long tail uh not on

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,440
the

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,480
uh like like on on the

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,880
just a few highly visible projects

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,240
absolutely i know um from a financial

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,280
services point of view

00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,240
um having react be an open source it

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,160
means that you know

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,440
our engineering leads can actually take

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,760
a look under the hood

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,520
at the code that's there and so it gives

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,079
you reassurance about the quality of the

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,760
product

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,359
rather than you know the odds of you

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,400
being able to contribute into the

00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,559
project

00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,079
um so from that point of view you know

00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,119
open source you know does increase

00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,880
quality

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,640
and it keeps the engineers accountable

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,440
for the work they're doing

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,160
um so if people actually follow you on

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,319
twitter

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,559
and you know look at all of the

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,800
tutorials you've been putting online

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,640
you actually spend a lot of time on

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,480
community engagement

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,319
would you say that's essential for

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,359
project success

00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:26,000
and what works best for building that

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,000
community

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,280
um yeah i i think i i don't actually

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:35,599
do as much of that now and it's kind of

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,839
a tough balance like i wish i

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,800
i had a good answer but like i'm just

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,920
learning

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,960
um because i think like early on

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,000
uh it really helped to react

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,280
that uh there was a uh

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,480
like i think react in that sense was

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,839
unusual because

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,240
uh like usually you would have dedicated

00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:02,640
people like developer advocates

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,400
uh actually uh um like

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,319
helping people understand the project

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,440
and like documenting and so on

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:11,760
and i think react from like from very

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,520
intentionally from early days it was

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,920
like most of that work was done by

00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,040
engineers working on it

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:22,000
um and so the downside of this

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,000
is that uh

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:29,839
so the upside of this is that it's uh

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,760
like the vision uh of

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,800
the the people promoting the product is

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,960
this like it

00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,240
it is guaranteed to be the same as the

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,880
vision of the people actually

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,200
like working on it so there is no like

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,200
chance of miscommunication or like

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,319
framing something that is like not

00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,680
entirely

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:53,119
correct uh so it is very uh like it is

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,640
very honest

00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,920
uh but the the downside of that is that

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,880
um as the project grows it doesn't

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,880
really scale

00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,000
so like you can't keep responding to

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,800
everyone

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,280
and also i think like one thing that i'm

00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,720
kind of

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,920
uh trying to figure out now is like

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,079
i think uh like

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,920
a few team members like including myself

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,200
become kind of the center of attention

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,400
where like all this energy is

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,559
concentrated

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,319
and that actually makes it harder for

00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:28,000
like newer people to break out

00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:30,480
into the like in the ecosystem because

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,920
um like they're not the ones being asked

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,200
questions like they don't get the same

00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,960
opportunities

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,480
so it becomes this very top-down

00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,040
structure uh even like unintentionally

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,799
um and i think that that's something

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,720
that uh like that's why i feel like

00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:47,359
like i don't really have advice because

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,839
like i i want to figure out how to

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,799
uh like decentralize it a little bit and

00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,079
maybe it not

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,960
not have to be as involved yeah actually

00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,359
that is a

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,280
really good well that's an unintentional

00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,920
consequence of you know that momentum

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,119
that your

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,280
own personal brand has built um so

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,400
how do you actually invite um other

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,000
engineers from

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,480
you know the open source community or

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,200
facebook into that you know how do you

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,599
delegate

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,520
you know all of that focus that you have

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,680
outwards so it becomes more federated

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,319
and less centralized

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,440
yeah and like i feel like some teams are

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,599
better at this

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,559
uh than us like i think view team is a

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,599
good example

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:31,200
uh like they even though there is a

00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:34,079
small kind of um like the project

00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,119
itself is driven by a a small number of

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,760
people

00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:40,160
they do a pretty good job at

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,480
distributing knowledge even like

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,240
um things that do that are top down like

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,480
there is uh there's a particular

00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,440
like direction that the team wants to to

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,640
take

00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:53,680
um they do kind of find ways to uh

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,960
distribute it across uh like educators

00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,799
and and like

00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,160
so that it's it doesn't seem like it's

00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:03,920
coming from like just a single source

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:07,040
so i think that that uh that helps um

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,160
but another part of this is just um

00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,040
better documentation for sure like

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,720
uh because like the reason people ask me

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,520
questions is just because like something

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,720
is not

00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:21,440
plainly stated in the darks

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,119
and that's like also partially like like

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,160
our fault because

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,400
uh for some things

00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,319
like for example like uh react hooks

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,000
right like it's a it's a uh it's a

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,400
pretty big shift in how you think about

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,280
react components uh it's like in the api

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,599
we introduced

00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,680
uh two years ago well i think it's

00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:44,000
almost three years ago by now

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:47,040
um and actually a bit over two years um

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,359
and it's

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,160
like at the time we didn't know how to

00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,040
use them

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,880
like sure we wrote the docs but like we

00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,720
didn't have two years of ex like nobody

00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,319
had the experience it's a novel concept

00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,559
it's like nobody like wrote code quite

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,160
the same way before and so of course we

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,119
didn't document a lot of things and

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,119
we're just

00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,880
because we are just finding them out and

00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,839
like we are finding them out through

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,160
those conversations and through those

00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,559
questions

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,240
but it's it's like you know you need to

00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,000
take time to kind of

00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,839
gather things and then you need to like

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,680
consolidate them and i think that's

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,119
that's the phase we're in now is like

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,559
we've learned all of those things from

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,280
those conversations

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,960
and now we need to put them in a like in

00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,880
the reference so that other people can

00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,680
refer to them without asking us

00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,480
yeah so we were talking about um

00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,880
federation versus centralization so with

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,599
um

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,520
reactors being an example did the

00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,280
requirements or the idea for that

00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,839
come from the community or did it come

00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,799
from the react team

00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,799
yeah um

00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,119
it's an interesting question i think

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,040
it's uh like there is a broader

00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,040
question here of like

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,160
the where does the division of react

00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,760
come

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,760
i think it's it's actually something

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,960
that is quite misunderstood

00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,359
uh in the community uh so like there are

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,760
people

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,680
who think that like facebook sets uh the

00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,760
direction of react

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,720
and i think like maybe we have said

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,720
something

00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,720
to that point that like that's the

00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,240
reason people are saying that is that we

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:25,200
we have miscommunicated earlier

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,079
but i think it's it's really neither

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,480
it's

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:30,480
it's neither facebook nor the open

00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:36,559
source community

00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:39,599
um i think the

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,640
so like um the

00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:45,680
the way i see it happening is that we

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,319
um we look at different problems

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,960
and like people bring problems to us

00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,000
right so

00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,400
and that happens both at facebook and

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,160
externally and like

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,319
there are different characteristics of

00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,920
like how that happens so like

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:05,119
um externally we get a larger volume

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,000
of problems but slightly lower quality

00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,760
because the barrier like to to like file

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,119
an issue is so low that

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,400
people can just like fix my code so it's

00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,640
uh you don't

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,240
like this signal to noise ratio is is

00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,200
not very effective

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,319
uh but the volume is so large that you

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,000
pick up on

00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,000
like you notice things that you wouldn't

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,119
like have you wouldn't have thought of

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,760
otherwise uh that like people run into

00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,599
so that gives you breath and then i

00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,040
think at facebook it's more about

00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,400
depth so facebook we also

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,400
like people also come to us with

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,760
problems and

00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,359
we can spend much longer time kind of

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,280
because like we have access to the

00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,760
product we don't just take their word

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,119
for it

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,680
that it's a problem we can like

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,680
literally run that code and see oh like

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,760
i see what they're saying i see how that

00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,200
influences the product

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,520
um so we get a lot of like

01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,079
much more depth from those conversations

01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,880
and though those investigations

01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,760
um but the solutions don't come from

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,200
that either

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,119
like that's just inputs and um

01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,480
i can't really say where solutions come

01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,079
from because like i'm not

01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,839
the primary person who comes up with

01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:23,440
them uh is mostly

01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:25,280
like sebastian or jack lead

01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,559
but the way he works is more like a

01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,440
scientist

01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:32,000
in the sense that uh he accumulates all

01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,480
these problems

01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
but then he kind of takes you know like

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,680
how you need to take a step

01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,160
back and see like how how

01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,119
like how did we how did we end up in

01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,400
this situation

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,319
and like what what are the different

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,920
things we could do um

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,920
but i think what is unique about

01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,319
sebastian from like my perspective

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,359
like compared to people i worked with is

01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:56,559
that he takes like

01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:59,599
10 steps back or like 15 steps back

01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,680
and he he discovers

01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:04,079
like pathways that like other people

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,760
didn't take for whatever reason

01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,119
uh that are actually like pretty

01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,440
interesting

01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,760
and so and like i think he's his

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,839
thinking is shaped by first principles

01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,520
which means that like it's not about

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,640
facebook not about open source it's

01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,920
about

01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:23,119
what is a user interface

01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,160
how does a computer work how do we make

01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,760
those things

01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,240
work together and it sounds really vague

01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,119
but

01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,799
uh i think like if he finds those

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,880
solutions and he's inspired like

01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,599
obviously he takes a lot of inspiration

01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,640
from

01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,160
things happening elsewhere right so it

01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,280
could be like compact competitor

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,480
frameworks

01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,960
but also again like his uh like he looks

01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,559
at

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,680
uh like things in programming language

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,960
research

01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,640
or like low-level graphics or

01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,720
like all of those things that he would

01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,160
usually not necessarily connect

01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,760
to front end but like he finds

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,839
inspiration there as well

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,520
and i think it's just this work like the

01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,000
way he comes up with solutions

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,839
is just this synthesis of different

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,960
things that he learned from like

01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,960
different places that's um an amazing

01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,640
observation because it's very easy to

01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,319
get caught in you know delivering

01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,760
features or doing what a business

01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,400
analysts ask you to do

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,079
you know and you know computer science

01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,680
is actually very creative and

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,520
it's a good opportunity to go back to

01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,200
the science and explore you know

01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,520
our roots and what we need to do in

01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,920
order to further things

01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,079
so within financial services um inner

01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,680
source is actually a really big um uh

01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,400
topic and that's all about the

01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,240
collaboration inside teams and inside um

01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,920
firewalls before you even get to open

01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,599
source so

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,359
what is the strategy at facebook

01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,920
regarding in a sourcing

01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:49,599
and open sourcing projects how does each

01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,720
team decide which project

01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:55,440
to open source yeah

01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,720
um i think this really comes down to

01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,720
individual engineers

01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,839
because like you can't force somebody to

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,240
open source a project

01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,559
and i think uh projects that have been

01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,119
open source have always had

01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,319
somebody who like felt really passionate

01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,359
about it

01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,160
and kind of convinced like other people

01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,240
that it's

01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,799
it's the right thing to do but then even

01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,680
if you open source it right there's like

01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:24,400
um there's different ways to do it and

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,000
um

01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,359
a lot of teams like they might open

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,039
source something and then they don't

01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:30,319
know

01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,760
well they just threw something over the

01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,480
wall but they don't work with the

01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,079
community

01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,039
or they um like they don't really

01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,440
explain

01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,400
uh what it is or they stop maintaining

01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,640
it so

01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,720
like in that case it's it's it's better

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,920
not to open source than to open source

01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,640
poorly

01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,599
um because that that just creates like a

01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,680
burden for

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,200
your users or you need to be very clear

01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,240
in expectations

01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,319
so we do have a process like we have a

01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,599
open source team that supports open

01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,280
source efforts

01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,880
um that is there like if you want to

01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,760
open source something you send them a

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,359
request

01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,880
and they like follow up with you just to

01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:09,760
check that you understand

01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,160
that like open source is a commitment uh

01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,760
that

01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,520
like it's it's not just throwing things

01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,359
over the wall um

01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,119
like what this thing is how is it

01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,559
different from what we already open

01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,359
source because like we have a large

01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,880
portfolio

01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,400
project um and we also they like they

01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,640
have a stage process

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,400
so we start in like uh something called

01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,640
like facebook incubator

01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,079
which is just a home to like all experts

01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,079
and i think like facebook experimental

01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,640
maybe that's what it's called

01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,200
but it's like a home to all the projects

01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,280
that

01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,280
we don't really know if like they're

01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,799
going to work out as open source

01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,720
and then if there is like if there is

01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,160
adoption and the team is still

01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,920
interested like eventually they kind of

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,039
graduate

01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,960
um but there are plenty uh there are

01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:57,039
plenty of libraries and solutions that

01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,960
like the authors are just not interested

01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,799
or they just feel that they

01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,400
bring more value to the company by

01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,760
focusing on

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,079
uh on like internal integrations and so

01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,200
they they explicitly decide against open

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,680
sourcing

01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:18,000
um and i think like that's also a

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,880
that's also a way of doing things um

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,319
i think just my kind of mantra there is

01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,880
just that it

01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,079
it's better not to open source than to

01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,079
open source poorly

01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,119
so you you need to really know like why

01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,280
you're doing it and

01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,720
what what you're hoping to get from it

01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,400
because

01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,319
like you're probably not going to get

01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,079
contributions like that's

01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,720
that's not the uh i think like a lot of

01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,240
people think that

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,000
that's like oh facebook is getting so

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,799
many contributions that's by the open

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,680
source

01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:48,640
uh for react we actually get sure we

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,720
have a lot of

01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:55,920
small contributions but uh

01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,400
the vast majority of the work is done by

01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,079
uh like folks uh employer facebook or

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,440
our partners like companies that we

01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,680
partner with

01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,599
um it's not like just like drive-by

01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,839
fixes uh

01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,039
that are like uh really making the big

01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,680
difference

01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,559
so open source is not about like getting

01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,880
something

01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,119
it's more about like if you feel that

01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,440
you want to influence the industry

01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,160
you want to share what you learned and

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,119
you want to

01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,640
put your approach under the scrutiny

01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,720
like i think that that's one of the most

01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,920
positive things about big company open

01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,319
source is that

01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,240
it keeps you honest uh because

01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,559
internally it's easy to stagnate

01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,280
there's like there's a solution everyone

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,280
uses it

01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,799
too hard to migrate away from and it

01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,400
just uh

01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,079
it's just like uh it just

01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,400
dominates within the company because

01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,319
there's nothing better

01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,319
but in the open source you're forced to

01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,200
confront that there are other solutions

01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,559
and they have different

01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,960
characteristics and now you have to

01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,440
compete and so that makes your product

01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,039
better because you have those like

01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,359
abstraction boundaries

01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,880
uh that that they can check that those

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,039
actually make sense

01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,720
yeah so i think that it's it's a good

01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:09,599
like self-check

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,119
if your code is actually like it yeah

01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,079
that's amazing thank you very much for

01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,119
that advice

01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:17,520
um so the final question

01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,240
so taking a look at your own um personal

01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,119
projects

01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,880
uh within your own um personal uh repay

01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,520
we noticed that you have a project there

01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,440
called done

01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,039
so this is the acronym so i know that

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,200
it's not actually called this but it's

01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,640
um called by some wider name but

01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:35,440
that wtf is so so what is that and and

01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,640
what's the motivation behind it

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,799
yeah so um it's kind of like a side

01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,039
project i actually forgot about it so i

01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,839
i need to add a few a few more

01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,520
definitions

01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:50,400
but it's uh it's a glossary

01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,920
of uh of like terms you might encounter

01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,119
in javascript

01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,440
um like closure hydration

01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,160
you know like things that sound like uh

01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,760
something

01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,359
computer science concepts like

01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,079
memorization

01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,880
uh some of them are just like uh some

01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,079
tooling

01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,599
or uh like just concepts that don't

01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,640
really make sense but that

01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,799
people kind of like

01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,640
that made their way into javascript

01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,199
developer vocabulary

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,279
um but the point of that glossary was i

01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:24,319
just can't find anything quite

01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,679
like if i wanted to explain like

01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,440
one of those words to somebody i

01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,480
couldn't find like a place to link them

01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,159
to you

01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,159
because uh wikipedia is just impossible

01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,679
to read it's like

01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:39,120
on computer science if you open

01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:42,159
something it's just i don't know

01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,159
there's they assume so much

01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:45,279
existing knowledge and like existing

01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,279
context

01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:50,159
and like uh they're over complicating

01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,400
things

01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,920
and then if you if you just search for

01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,560
like simple definitions

01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,679
uh on like blogs and articles a lot of

01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,239
them are playing wrong

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,080
or misleading uh like the person

01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,679
misunderstood something and then

01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,359
and then like wrote an article about it

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:08,719
that's super calm and i mean like

01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,880
i i i can fall to the same thing as well

01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,640
hopefully because like my material gets

01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,759
a lot of circulation people will point

01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:18,080
out the mistakes um

01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,759
yeah i guess that's kind of the

01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,520
motivation is just to

01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,880
have something that is worth it in a way

01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,440
i would explain

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,319
a concept to someone over lunch yeah

01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,319
yeah

01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,920
and what i was thinking so earlier in

01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,679
the interview you said

01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,600
people should actually be contributing

01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,480
to the smaller libraries and the more

01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,000
long tail kind of solutions and so this

01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,400
could actually be a perfect

01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,319
um you know project for people within

01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,600
the finos community to raise pool

01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,799
requests against

01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,600
to help you maybe flesh it out yeah i

01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,960
don't think

01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:54,000
this one is a good example because uh

01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:58,320
it is also intentionally um

01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,360
it has a very kind of um

01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,120
well-defined voice so it's

01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,360
it's like my writing it is very

01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,840
intentionally um

01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,120
i don't think like uh anyone would write

01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,120
in exactly the same way

01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,880
and like i wanted to be written with my

01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,600
particular voice that's that's kind of

01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,760
like

01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,880
an aspect of this project but similar

01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,040
projects sure

01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,480
like they they would sure and like

01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,159
especially because people don't

01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,080
contribute as much to

01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,199
like they want to contribute code they

01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,880
don't want to like contribute

01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:28,560
documentation as much

01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,640
but that's actually like documentation

01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,800
is one of the things that

01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,800
can be like really really difficult

01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,000
especially writing good one

01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,080
um so so maybe one way people could

01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,520
actually help you is by racing an issue

01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,960
you know something that they found that

01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,000
you might want to consider

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:49,120
for inclusion in the glossary

01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,040
yeah that's awesome so thank you dan for

01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,560
joining me today but before we leave

01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,080
how can people follow the work that

01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,800
you're doing in the open source

01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,040
community

01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,880
and potentially leverage it for their

01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,400
own projects

01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:05,760
um yeah

01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:08,640
i i don't i don't know uh because i

01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,600
i have a twitter but i i mostly just

01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,640
like

01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,760
uh post random things there

01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,360
in part because like especially lately i

01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,640
feel like

01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,679
twitter has gotten so uh like i mean

01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,960
technical twitter

01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:28,239
has gotten very kind of polarized uh

01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,239
in terms of like oh like this library

01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,600
like it's bad at this library is like

01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,800
but it's it's just

01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,280
it's very emotionally taxing so i

01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,719
kind of stepped away from like technical

01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,679
discussions on twitter

01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,400
um and i prefer to have them on github

01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,280
so

01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,840
but if i think like if we release

01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,000
anything

01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,400
important like if you're interested in

01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,120
react just follow the react.js twitter

01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,199
account

01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,719
that's uh anything important will be

01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:57,600
there for sure

01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:59,199
and on the vrjs blog so again like we

01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,760
post anything that's on the blog that's

01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,080
going to be

01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,440
cross-posted on twitter uh so you can

01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,199
follow react.js

01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,880
as for my personal work uh you can

01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:11,199

um but just be prepared that it's a lot

01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,440
of random stuff and then somewhere in

01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,760
the middle maybe i

01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,800
post something about a project i work on

01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,560
