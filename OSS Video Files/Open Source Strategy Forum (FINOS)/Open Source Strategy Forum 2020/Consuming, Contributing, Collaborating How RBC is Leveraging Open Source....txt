thank you all for being here

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,880
my name is kim prado and i run client

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,280
banking

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
and digital technology across capital

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,080
markets at rbc

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
what does this mean i manage all

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,119
technology that pertains to client

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,840
all the touch points all the trades all

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
the data

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
as well as our external properties

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,039
websites etc

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,920
my main focus is to enhance the customer

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,640
experience

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,520
for our users through our tools and

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
applications

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,960
as well as to assist them at deepening

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
of their relationships with external

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
clients

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
as you can imagine this is very

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
challenging

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,680
and can take many avenues to achieve

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,000
this goal

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,039
we have built applications from the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
ground up

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
we've purchased new software that we've

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
integrated into our ecosystem we have

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,039
hired

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,079
experts in the field of big data and

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,479
analytics

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,240
we have hired data scientists we have

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,439
partnered with universities

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,400
and our own internal innovation labs

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,799
but perhaps the one thing that has stood

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,520
out

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
over the last few years has been our

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,040
partnership

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
with the finnos and linux foundation and

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
the success

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,400
we have had in the open source community

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
so i am here today to talk to you about

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
our journey

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,520
the challenges we face how we overcame

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
those challenges

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
our focus on the customer experience and

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
how

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,840
we have benefited from our partnership

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
with the open source community

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,119
so i always like to start with our

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,479
strategy which is one two three

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,439
first we go and we collect all the data

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
we take we we bring it all together the

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,280
trades

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,960
the miss trades the crm information

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
the structured information the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
unstructured data

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
you name the data set the first thing we

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
do

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,959
is bring that data together then we

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
layer

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,879
intelligence on top what does that mean

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,760
well

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,640
alexa who covers pimco that's what i

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,680
mean

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,720
we want to take the data and make it

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,920
smart right serve up those customized

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
experiences

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,239
but in a way that is so seamless to our

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,360
user hence number three

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,280
the client experience serving our data

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,519
up in a way that is proactive actionable

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:44,160
and leads to leads to true revenue lifts

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,800
is our main goal so how do we do this

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,440
well let me take you back in time as you

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
can see

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,519
we're having a vintage user experience

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,160
right now

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,959
so this is our application called sales

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,159
book that we

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:03,200
started years ago in built it out in wpf

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,760
but what this did was lay the foundation

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
for us to collect the data the

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
e-commerce

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,480
all the electronic trades all the

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,120
inquiries all the executed trades

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319
the missed trades all the holdings all

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
the market data

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,760
all the pricing you name the data set we

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,159
lead the pipes from 2014

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
till even till now to collect this

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,400
information

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,599
right but this is where we were in 2014

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
through 2018.

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,920
fast forward to 2018

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,200
2017 2018 our journey is still vintage

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,720
however we tried we made an attempt at

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,959
using html5

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,120
ourselves so the evolution was dot-net

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,280
wpf html5 but we learned very quickly

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
that in the html5 space

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
we needed help so that brought us to

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
here

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
and at this point we integrated with

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
openfin

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,599
and they helped us really take our html5

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,720
strategy to the next level

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,599
but this is where we got to by creating

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,200
the rbc

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,680
ecosystem so using workflow

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,359
interop all those good things we've been

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
able to bring together

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,400
all our different analytics and data

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,400
sets

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,759
so from this screen you can see our

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,040
client analytics

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,520
our client flow our client 360

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
and our notifications on the bottom

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,560
and then leveraging all of that and all

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,880
the additional data sets

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
in the ecosystem we've been able to

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,199
continue to integrate the community

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,479
and as you can see from our client flow

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,160
blotter you'll see

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,040
all the all of the third-party idbs

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,240
trading systems integrated right

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,160
we'll move on that sets up all up for

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,360
our partnership with bloomberg

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,080
which enabled us to integrate our own

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,960
bulletin platform in with the bloomberg

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
windows

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,120
and then our flow aura blotter

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
with the bloomberg windows and on in our

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
bloomberg chat

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
integration with our system through

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,000
interop

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
and then our bulletin but you can see

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
these are the old windows right

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,520
well these are the old windows that were

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
slowly migrated to the new windows

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,400
but we were able to do this in a phased

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,039
approach that did that enabled us to buy

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,080
time and train our users and get exactly

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,680
what they needed

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,800
but that wasn't enough so that led us to

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
open source

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
so if you can't build it and you can't

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
buy it

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
then you want to open source it right so

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
this is the evolution of how

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,080
we were able to sell the idea of open

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,400
source within the rd within rbc

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,560
so in the 1890s everybody was building

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
build build built then we had the rise

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,039
of the vendors

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,199
and it was built in and buy and now

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,400
open source so the fitness organization

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,639
has led us to the to the point where

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,520
we've been able to integrate with many

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,280
of the projects that are going on

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
specifically i'm going to speak to

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,800
perspective which was originally

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
contributed by j.p morgan

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,440
and if you go to fitness.org and github

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,280
slash video

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
you can see the perspective libraries

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
are there they're easy to download and

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,680
they're easy to use

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,080
but why am i such a prospective fan well

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
let me show you why

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
so here's an example of one of the

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,319
screens that we were able to integrate

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
into perspective integrate using

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,039
perspective

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,360
so this data that you're looking at here

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,240
has millions of rows associated with it

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
it's slow it was hard to bring into a

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,319
screen

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,560
it took forever for me to get our

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
developers to make one simple little pie

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,919
chart

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,120
well what perspective has given us is

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,479
the ability

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,880
to actually provide visualization

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
on top of our data sets in a

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,840
configurable way

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
so underneath here you'll see okay this

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
is

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,800
a neat heat map and a chart but within

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,360
the prospective ecosystem

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
there's probably another 30 plus

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
visualizations that are available

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,360
so once you plug your data set into the

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,120
prospective libraries

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,440
you very quickly are able to deliver

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
really interesting information about

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,080
your data

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,960
so for example here in arsenal higher

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
spend

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,319
again this is all dummy data you can

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,680
quickly see

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,759
how much we're spending with that

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
company right and

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
across what lines of business and what

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,319
sectors etc

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:58,000
but the key here is nobody had to code

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,759
so it's configuration

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
through the supply through the

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
prospective libraries

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,199
anyone and i mean anyone in the

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
organization

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,400
can can set it up themselves so what

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
we've

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,479
what we've had to do is put governance

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
around who's allowed to do this

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,759
and entitlements and so on but through

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
that

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,520
we've been able to deliver faster

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
cheaper

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,400
and so much more advanced features

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,160
in such a short period of time that um

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,080
that it's enabled our business to just

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,880
be able to make decisions

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
so much easier it's also enabled our

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,039
quant teams

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,919
to be able to visual see visualizations

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,680
of data

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,080
quickly so as they're working through

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,320
new models they can very easily see

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,279
you know how is this working right what

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,839
if analysis

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:53,360
and so on so that leads me here

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,080
so the pandemic strikes right

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
everybody's shifting all so this leads

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,399
us to

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,600
this which is one of my favorite ways of

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,880
looking at

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,000
open source versus build versus buy

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,120
so if you think about an asset light

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,680
economy what does that mean well

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
uber let's look at uber for a second

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
uber doesn't have

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,959
cars right they don't they don't have a

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,680
lot of people

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,240
right they don't pay for that it's acid

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
light

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,920
they have third-party people who drive

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
their own car

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
to deliver people where they want to go

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,519
same with doordash

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,640
uber eats etc it's an asset

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,519
light economy and i like to think of

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,880
open source

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,760
in the same way it's asset light i don't

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,440
have to go

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,080
hire developers to build visualizations

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
i can leverage the open source community

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,160
for that feature

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,440
i don't have to go buy you know hire

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
developers to build

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
interop i can leverage the open source

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,040
community for that

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,160
so by thinking asset lite you're able to

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,440
think what can i do without adding

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,200
more cost and overhead to the overall

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
program so if you look here this article

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,720
is saying the emergence and growth of

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
virtual businesses

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,920
provide right i can't stress this

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,920
this enough like the amount of times

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
i have sat in meeting rooms and the

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,880
business needs something

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,040
and my it department my it team says

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,240
well i'm gonna need to add three bodies

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,000
to deliver that

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,519
if i had a dollar for every time that

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
work that that ass

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,440
came up i wouldn't need to be working

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,440
anymore right

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,040
so the more we can look to the open

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,839
source community

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
for things or software or solutions that

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,560
are

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,480
part of the way there we are then in

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,079
turn saving our business

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,399
money we're buying time you know we're

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,399
our time to market goes up and we're not

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,120
spending as much money

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,120
so let me walk you through why i'm so

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,640
why i'm such a believer of this

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,399
and the asset light model again just

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
focusing on perspective

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,640
which again i just want to repeat was

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,600
originally contributed by jp morgan so

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,320
thank you jp morgan for doing this

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
um so perspectives code base currently

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
sits

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
at approximately 170

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
000 lines of code today in the open

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
source

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,680
iteration right divided up 40

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,720
javascript 30 c plus and

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,360
20 python 30 000

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,440
lines of this was developed internally

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,480
as proprietary software

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
before open sourcing so over its

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,120
lifetime

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
as open source the code base has seen

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,040
well over

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,079
a million lines of code committed or

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,600
altered that is

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,639
the poster child for open source right

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,200
that is why that is why

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,200
i am such a fan that's just one example

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,200
4191 commits

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
to the open source repo with 500 coming

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
in

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,480
outside of jp morgan chase

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,920
come on that in itself is just

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,040
mind-blowing right so

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,440
with this you know perspective has over

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,560
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,079
000 test scenarios which we run on 15

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,839
separate os hardware configurations

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:39,360
so i mean why not try it right

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,360
what's your downside and so what we've

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,880
been able to see at rbc

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,920
is time savings head count savings

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,240
cost savings but most but

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,079
really really the biggest one is the

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,360
reputational savings

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,720
we are using software that

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,320
right out of the gate is adopted

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,120
and really really appreciated

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
and has taken our business to another

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
level

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,440
right because they are not the first

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
ones to use it

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
they don't have to live through the fact

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,519
that we delivered something oh and the

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,800
qa oh we miss that will come back

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,839
right the quality factor is

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,200
way higher in fact by doing this it has

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,240
raised the bar

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,480
on my development team so high

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
that they're looking to use as much open

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
source as possible

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,639
across now

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
so where are we heading with all of this

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,760
right

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,839
so we are building out our next

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
generation of tooling again using

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,320
perspective

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,040
using open source by and using

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,360
you know the content the concept of

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,000
searching across the data set

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,240
called the cortex so right here you're

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,560
looking at a filtered view of one of our

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,760
one of our accounts granted this is all

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,199
development data so

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,760
nobody worried it's all qa data

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,600
but what we're showing here is being

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,680
able to filter down

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
and then quickly visualize the

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,839
information

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,240
right so if you filter on one client

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,360
you get their live stream but you also

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
get

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
neat visualizations that tell you what

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,800
your next step is or

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,040
what your next action is that tied in

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,440
with our concept of a smart chat window

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,880
it's not really a chat window it's a

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,320
smart just question window right

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,959
so what is the month to date you know uh

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
revenue for rock inc right and that

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,279
gives you a search window of

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,680
all the data sets so if you think about

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,720
it

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,600
we're enabling searching but we're also

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,279
enabling

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,760
a smart question window so

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,360
really i don't want to call it a chatbot

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
but i want to call it

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,360
a smart answer window so

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,120
for example right now you have to go to

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,720
multiple places you'd have to go to

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
multiple places to ask multiple

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,839
questions

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,120
what the cortex does is it ties it all

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,440
together

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
right it's one window where you can ask

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,079
it any question you want

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,560
and it will bring you back an answer but

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,680
more important than that what this does

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,199
is it ties together

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,680
the whole strategy it's showing

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,480
it exposes all the data we collected in

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
one

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
it exposes all the analytics we're

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
putting into

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
and then it's serving it up in a

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,160
customized client experience

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
for our end users

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,720
thank you all for taking the time to

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:49,920
attend my presentation

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:49,920
