good local time everybody

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,320
um my name is justin ratcliff and um

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
we're going to be doing this

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,880
presentation

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
around kind of avoiding your own jungle

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,240
of the commercial software supply chain

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680
uh it's a riff essentially on upton

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,080
sinclair's book

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
the jungle we're not going to be talking

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,000
about meat packing plants

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,239
that's not the discussion we're going to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,040
be having we're going to apply the same

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
kind of

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,960
concepts and the metaphor to our own

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
supply chains

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,160
the ones that we produce and the ones

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,520
that we consume

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
through commercial services uh so a

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
little bit about who

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,480
i am uh so i work for fidelity

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,360
investments

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,440
uh i kind of handle all their open

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,199
source stuff i lead up their open source

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
program office

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
i'm the kind of main point of contact

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
for linux foundation

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,159
in the to do group which is all the open

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,000
source program office leads

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,159
internally it's really just being that

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520
the advocate for doing cool things in

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,320
open source

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
at fidelity and that could be we want to

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
use it

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
we want to patch it we want to

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,479
contribute it

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,080
we want to work with a supplier who

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,320
depends on it which is pretty much all

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,200
of them

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,479
so i tend to be fairly busy and uh but

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,479
it's it's fun stuff

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
um and just because this is a global

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,000
event uh i

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,320
am in cary north carolina which is part

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,439
of the research triangle park

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,079
uh it says a little geolocation

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,000
um so why does this matter to me

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,520
and we all know that open source is in

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,119
everything we've all seen all the

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,799
surveys

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,280
all the information all the stuff

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,920
gathered i did a little video

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
i didn't write this app somebody else's

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
um

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,560
but i it's going to

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,759
kind of go through react native just an

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,680
npm that

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,880
many of us may have used we may use

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,840
internally

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
we may kind of watch

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,160
and yeah i just want you to kind of see

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,599
why and i think a visual really just

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,239
kind of helps

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,480
so i'm selecting out react native and

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,160
what it's doing is it's walking through

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,200
every single module that mpm is pulling

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
out

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,959
um so this is the kind of normal speed

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,000
of the thing um i realized though that

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,720
this was going a little slow

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
so i actually had to accelerate time

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
it's going to

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
pop in right about now and what's

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,959
happening

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,560
is again every single link every single

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,200
module is being

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,959
connected and potentially creating

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,959
another edge

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:03,519
and you can see wow

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,480
so i just included one react native

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,440
and all of a sudden my software supply

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
chain

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,040
looks like this um

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,200
that's a little complicated so that's it

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,760
so almost 600 packages were needed

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,319
uh they're linked a thousand times and

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,519
that's

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,319
all the people who are responsible

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
in contributing to making react native a

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,319
reality

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,560
so that i can use it um

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,080
yikes it's not necessarily bad they're

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,840
all doing really really cool

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,879
stuff but it's pretty complicated

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,200
and that's both what we

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:51,040
absorb when we write our own software

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120
but also what what also contributes to

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
some some areas of risk when we source

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,959
somebody else's

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,280
software so the kind of the narrative is

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
is

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,239
really figuring out uh

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,080
what are people doing do they care about

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
their bill materials

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
do they have concerns around this are

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,439
all those

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,799
modules really needed

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,840
and and what does it mean to

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,120
to uh quote unquote um

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,000
operate locally eat locally and

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
really understand what my supply chain

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,040
means to me

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
so um this is a quote

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,320
from the jungle i'm not going to read it

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,000
out loud

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,639
um but again this this idea

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,639
that we're getting a product and it's a

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,520
fine product probably was put in the can

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,400
may have a nice label on it um that's

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
awesome

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,960
uh now that if you kind of apply this

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,840
beyond the the concept of food

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,280
um this could be an endpoint from a

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,360
cloud service provider

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,040
this could be a commercial distribution

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,039
this could be a commercial

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
of open source it could be a commercial

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,960
product that's both proprietary and

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,560
open source but if you don't know what's

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,520
inside it

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
well how do you know it's good for you

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,639
um

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,880
how do you know it's not been doctored

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,960
and again this was a problem

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
that the book was written to kind of

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,039
resolve and to wrestle with and it

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
caused a whole lot of changes

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,280
when we look at food quality for the

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,400
united states

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,210
and it's kind of a turning point when we

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
look at

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,320
[Music]

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
what is what's the responsibility for

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,039
the social good and keeping people

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
healthy

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,160
and what's responsibility for the the

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
producer

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
because they can't they don't have an

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
infinite budget people only

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
willing to spend so much um

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,440
but it's important to kind of wrestle

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,440
with these these kind of questions

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,479
so kind of like i mentioned before um

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,479
people use open source no shocker so

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,680
again this comes from the to do group

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,600
um i look like i need to refresh it to

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,800
the 2020

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,160
but we look at the ratios

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
and this is only so that people were

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
willing to admit

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,280
for those who have already been taking

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
the survey they felt comfortable talking

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,400
about it

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,280
honestly i feel like most uh products

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,120
commercial

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,600
or commercial distributions of open

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,199
source they include open source

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,800
it's a big part of what we do today and

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,080
so those numbers i actually probably

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,039
think are a little bit low um

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,759
and when we have to take this as kind of

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,600
a

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,880
an end-to-end thing well if that amount

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,880
of open source

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,400
is sitting in our commercial products

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,319
we're sitting at the other side of an

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,919
end point for a software as a service

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,880
product

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,400
and we're giving them their our data for

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,120
them to protect

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,240
well other people supply chain matters

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,639
as well

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,160
and life comes at you fast

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,000
there's always something

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
new um again

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
before we used to source things from

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,199
some big

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,560
commercial supplier that could be any

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
name brand that you know

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,919
cisco microsoft whatever the case may be

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,520
it's not that those are bad but the

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
world is very different

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,720
and oftentimes those same suppliers are

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,960
contributing to open source projects

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
and it's not that those closed source

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,880
projects were without bugs or

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,919
errors um but oftentimes we we kind of

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,400
trusted the brand

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,759
came with some credibility uh fidelity

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,080
investments is very

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,199
brand uh brand centric um you come to us

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,479
as a as a broker as someone who will

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
make a trade

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,160
or manage your retirement um those are

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,639
really

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
important things those are long lasting

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,840
things

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
and it's that trust that that's there in

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,160
the brand

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
with an open source project it's harder

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,199
to draw that bright line

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,560
and there could be a number of reasons

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,759
why that project

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,080
could have problems and again

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
companies can have problems it happens

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,520
all the time

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,560
but how do we make ourselves aware of

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,919
those things

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
so what can be done

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,199
i think one of the kind of the basic

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,440
things is

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
basic education talk to your developers

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,120
about it

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
um make it kind of part of their

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,839
curriculum

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,200
oftentimes they're required to take some

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,000
basic security

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,880
well tie in some light and license tie

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,519
in some open source life cycle

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
if we know that they're going to be 60

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,560
70 80 90

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
of their code base is going to be open

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
source

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
well let's make sure they understand

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
what they're getting and how they're

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,800
getting it

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,320
they don't need to be an expert we have

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,320
application security teams for a reason

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
we have open source program offices for

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,560
a reason

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,800
this allows again some of those those uh

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,560
policy type questions things that are

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
really down in the weeds

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
what does a pharaoh gpl mean to me kind

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,000
of things

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,240
well that's not the responsibility of

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480
every developer be really expensive

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
it would take a lot of their time but

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
there's some basic

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
operations of dealing in an open source

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
world

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,560
that actually can be educated it can be

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
part of that portfolio

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,000
so that as they're developing that

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
application

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,680
they can go in it with with eyes open um

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,680
if they see a license and they know that

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,800
this is for a mobile app well

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,720
that's a distribution i have to keep

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,160
keep an eye out for the gpl it doesn't

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
mean you can't use it

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
but there might be other things that we

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,120
as an organization need to do

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
if if we do so let's try to figure that

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,360
out

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,959
um you can be an advocate

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,959
for tools and practices that make sense

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,480
for stuff that generates a level of

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
ownership and accountability

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,760
giving developers options

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,279
telling a developer hey you can only

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
choose

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
this color or this front-end web dev

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,680
framework

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,640
probably is not going to end up well

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,079
it's going to be a little bit of a

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,240
demotivator

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,279
and well they're probably going to get a

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,480
bit of shadow i.t

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,440
going because this is a fast-moving

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
environment

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
we're always being incented to take a

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
look at

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,360
alternatives and different technology

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
and there's some good to that and we

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
want to be able to foster that as

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,079
organizations

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
but there's also some risk to it so we

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,959
have to be able to measure that

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
um so tools and processes especially

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,279
like with the react

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,680
native example you can't be policing 600

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,800
dependencies that probably are changing

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,480
every day that's not a scalable thing

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,839
for a person to do

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,519
tools can do it really really well

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,079
though um

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
and we need to be that advocate to take

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,920
that

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,399
put tools in the appropriate locations

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,160
and then get that data to developers

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,680
along with some education to help them

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
kind of distill that and say what does

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,440
this mean to me

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,880
not just gates not just hard policies

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,360
but really understanding what those

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,839
motivations are why does this matter in

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
this case but maybe not in this case

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
um inviting the developers to the

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,839
conversation

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
can be really really important and this

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,800
is also

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,079
part of engaging with commercial

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,800
suppliers

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,920
so when you ask them for for a bill of

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,839
materials

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
or what is their practice around open

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
source governance

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
they don't have an answer well it's not

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
a bad thing some people have just not

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
thought about it

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
but being curious can actually really

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
help them

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
they may actually have something but you

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
may be talking with a salesperson or a

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
legal person

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,279
and they have to bring in a subject

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
matter expert those are important

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,600
conversation to have

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,600
and again being that advocate advocate

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,079
for tools and practices

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
even in our commercial supply chains

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,959
very valuable

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
because oftentimes everybody's looking

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,680
at the bottom line whether it's products

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
you're writing or products you're

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,320
purchasing

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,360
so if if customers are not asking for a

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
capability

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,279
or an artifact or something along those

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
lines you're probably not going to get

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,160
it

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,800
in this case if more people ask for it

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,399
it'll become normalized kind of like

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,399
wearing masks

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,720
where we're figuring this thing out

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,120
together

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
and then engaging in the thought and the

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
sustainability integrity

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,320
of our own supply chain so caring about

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
it

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,320
investing your talent investing your

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,880
dollars um

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
not just asking the questions um to our

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,000
commercial suppliers

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,839
but potentially writing upstream patches

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,880
helping to again move those ecosystems

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,760
forward um

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,160
it's really really interesting and fun

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
stuff

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,839
so um we need to basically we need to

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,079
expect more

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,600
we need to look at it and say hey we

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,160
can't just trust what it's on the

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,320
shelves

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
it's not that it's bad we can give it a

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,880
little bit of trust

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
um but it's it's still a little bit wild

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,200
west there

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,360
um there is no usda of software

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,399
there's no one making sure this stuff is

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,920
good even

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,240
with all the flaws of of uh the usda

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,959
checks and being able to time them and

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,800
the overhead

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,720
it's not a perfect system but it is a

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,079
system and it helps

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,160
most of the time us in the states

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,399
to eat food safely we can rely on it

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,920
we don't have that for software

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,199
especially when we get beyond

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,920
legal and copyright related stuff

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,199
security best practices or maintenance

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
best practices

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,320
there's a lot of best practices not a

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,519
lot of

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
policies or regulations um so being able

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,040
to say what is

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,440
good is a lot more complex

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
so uh here's some specifics i'm going to

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
kind of

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,519
run through them um kind of four points

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,959
that i think can make a big difference

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,120
in in avoiding uh essentially

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,040
bad stuff making into our own supply

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,240
chains whether from things that we buy

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,920
or things we pull in from github or npm

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,920
um so knowing your bill of materials

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,120
uh seems to be kind of an obvious one

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,560
but often times teams overlook it

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
maybe they just look at their direct

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,800
dependencies even if they have it

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,279
they may avoid doing transitive work

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,000
and again maybe back in the day when you

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,920
had five or ten or fifteen dependencies

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,680
and then we're kind of big let's call

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,760
them java

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,279
maybe that was a feasible way of

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,519
approaching this

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,279
but now we have these heavily integrated

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,720
interrelated ecosystems

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,480
like node in npm that

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,880
understanding your real bill of

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,680
materials not just the surface stuff

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,160
gets complicated again as we saw him

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,360
react native

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,160
quality ingredients so

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
a little bit of the food theme again but

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
uh

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
buying things that you can trust um and

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,880
then

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
how do you trust things what are

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,000
characteristics of the things that you

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
do trust

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
uh those can be hard questions is it

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,079
just because you find it on a store

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,959
shelf

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,079
that you should apply some trust to it

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,920
maybe

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,480
um but there's some other options there

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
uh organizational preferences i think is

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
one that

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,959
that smaller organizations can get by

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
with

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,440
um but as you get into bigger

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,440
organizations fidelity has a wide

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,959
breadth of developers

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,040
we have those who are still responsible

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,399
for our mainframe those who are still

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,240
writing cobol

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
um and then we have those who are

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,680
responsible for our mobile apps

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,680
um both have equal responsibilities to

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,600
security and compliance and all that

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
kind of good stuff

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
their needs are really different though

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,000
based around the ecosystems that they

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,600
deal with

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,199
the velocity of change in those

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,519
ecosystems

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:34,000
so being able to apply some context

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,199
into understanding your supply chain can

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,360
really make a difference to your

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,920
developers

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,680
because what what works for a mobile

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,160
a mobile developer probably won't work

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,160
for a mainframe developer

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,639
and recognizing that make sure the

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
policies and practices reflect that

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,120
they're not overly biased in one

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,120
direction

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,399
but just making sure that

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,160
organizationally we can

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,079
we can figure it out and then mine that

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,199
data

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,720
to to help the next set of developers

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,559
uh and then again investing upstream

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,520
so software bill materials um this is

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,280
a little bit complicated um there's a

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,799
couple specifications out there

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,319
i put a couple of them on there so you

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,319
have spdx

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
so that's the linux foundation's uh

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,760
primary one

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,760
there's also cyclone dx a little lighter

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
weight i'm finding

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,919
some organizations are adopting that as

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,360
opposed to spdx

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,799
not going to get into specification wars

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,480
the the goal is that it's machine

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,160
readable though

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,280
you don't want the back of the cocktail

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,880
napkin kind of ingredients list

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,520
you want something that it should be

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,360
somewhat reliable and it's been created

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,559
by an automated tool now if you ever

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,360
looked at either of those schemas

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,520
you're not going to write those by hand

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,919
so being able to adopt

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,039
a bill of material bill of materials

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,000
schema

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,799
that is machine readable but can still

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,360
be converted to something human readable

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,799
it's super important and it becomes a

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,360
what they're intended to be

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,960
in exchange i could have a supplier to

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,400
give me that and say hey yeah these are

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,480
all my ingredients

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,880
um and i should be able to trust it a

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,559
little bit

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,960
one thing to always remember though is

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,760
these bills and materials are generated

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,919
by

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,000
sometimes open source sometimes

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,960
proprietary code bases

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,039
they're all built around heuristics and

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,720
it could be natural language processing

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,320
or kind of fragment analysis

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
and tokenization and all this kind of

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,240
fun parsing stuff that somewhere in the

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
back of my head

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,919
from the days of writing software but

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
um they're they're in some ways

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,400
proprietary

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
and everybody might come up with

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,039
something a little bit different which

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,799
is why you

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,039
you need that kind of normalized or

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,559
neutral schema to hand it off to

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,880
somebody else

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,960
um there's a couple of plenty of open

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,600
source options i put a couple there so

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,919
pathology uh linux foundation project

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,520
next be scan code very popular project

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,280
out there

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
certain organizations will use something

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
like the oauth dependency check

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,320
dependency track projects heavily kind

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,880
of

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,200
uh core in the java world but but doing

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,039
a lot more than that lately

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
and then there's also any number of

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,120
commercial

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
entities getting into this space they

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,559
all realized that

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
static analysis for security and dynamic

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
analysis for security

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,400
when it was 100 proprietary code maybe

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,039
that made sense

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,480
um but now with open source composition

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,600
analysis

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,799
um is is kind of a key part of your

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,960
of your pipeline um because

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,160
what you do with those findings is a

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,360
little bit different

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,520
they may become a cve it may be

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,280
something that is publicly registered

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
with the government

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,360
and possibly has an answer it says hey

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,760
just update

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,559
those are important parts that we can

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,240
take uh

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,280
take part of um we also have platform

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,799
capabilities

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,840
so a couple github and gitlab both have

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,320
have kind of accepted that dependency

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,320
analysis

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,440
should be should just be a platform

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,679
capability

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
you can use those dependent dependency

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,280
graph

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,400
to feed any number of other types of

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,280
systems

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,440
a security system do you have any cves

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,720
for this dependency

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,679
it could be a licensing system

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
or if this is a distributable artifact

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
do you have gpl

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,200
code in it and does that create a

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,760
concern or it could be a maintenance

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,080
type of concern is this project being

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,880
maintained

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,960
and being able to surface those kind of

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,440
indicators

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,440
can be very valuable to a developer but

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,400
they're all based around that core

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
bill of material

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,320
so when we're thinking about the the

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,799
bill materials a lot of concerns you

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,280
have to bring in

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,200
one is declared versus observed and then

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,360
we get into licensing in that way

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,679
so a lot of projects will say hey this

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,679
is a license that i'm under

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,679
but then if you look at its dependencies

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,880
so that transitive dependency chain

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,640
well really

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,559
if you're including gpl but you're

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,000
declaring that you're apache

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,640
that doesn't work um so what can we do

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
about that

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,760
well you may not be able to resolve that

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,080
yourself that may

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,919
take some upstream work but you have to

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,440
be able to surface those things and

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:50,000
that's a great role of a tool

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,120
and then when we think about end of life

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
technology life cycle management

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,480
how do we get this type of data

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,559
available to our developers

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,679
because if it isn't broke oftentimes we

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,039
don't fix it

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,120
um and then if it does break

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,080
and well you haven't fixed it for or

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,039
haven't maintained it

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,039
for a decade that could be a lot more

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,720
complex of the fix

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,159
we like to get our oil changes done

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,760
regularly

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,120
even if the engine doesn't seize um so

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
we have to be able to kind of get ahead

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,400
of that stuff and keep to a regular

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,320
cadence

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,120
and a lot of that will all be built

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,280
around a bill of materials

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,159
and again this may sound like it only

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,559
matters the software that we're writing

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
but feel free to talk to your to your

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,840
commercial suppliers

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,720
some of them will put their third-party

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,919
notices or attribution notice or

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,440
some form of disclosure on their website

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,039
to say hey these are the open source

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,320
works that we depend on

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,960
possibly even the version that it

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,000
depends on

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,120
so you can use those but

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,559
ask can you pro excuse me can you

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
provide me

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,200
a software bill material because if they

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,559
can and they can do it on a pretty rapid

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,080
pace

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
probably they have a good process and

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,440
practice in place they know what's

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,840
inside their code base

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
they may have policies built off that

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,400
bill of materials

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,320
so it becomes a strong indicator that

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,000
they're aware of what's going into their

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,480
products

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,600
if they look at you and kind of go no

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,520
clue

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,360
um well it doesn't mean there's a

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,280
problem again you could be talking to

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,600
the wrong person

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,960
but it is something that's not

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,159
necessarily

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,799
intuitive to them and it may be a growth

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,720
area

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,039
um there's something an area of risk

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,120
that they weren't aware of before

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,559
and you're helping make them more aware

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
of the criticality

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,400
because you're going to be giving them

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,600
some sort of data

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,679
that could be very minor a query

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,360
um for maybe public data um

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,799
say a stock picker or something like

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,520
that

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,279
or it could be personalized personally

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,080
identifiable information

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,559
tii so be in the regulated space that

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,279
matters a lot

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,640
so being able to surface that is is

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,000
really important

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,039
and helping organizations know

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,960
you're not out there to to nitpick

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,400
their software development life cycle

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
what you're there is to say hey i'm

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,279
giving you

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,679
potentially the keys to the kingdom

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,120
something that represents my brand

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,440
and i want to make sure you'll care for

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,440
it that you'll protect it

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
and that you understand all the things

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
that go into it

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,799
because oftentimes they're very

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,080
comfortable with doing this for

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,520
their subcontractors maybe a geography

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
type of check

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
for any kind of procurement we don't

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,559
think of it for software

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,000
but it does matter and you're also

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
seeing a lot of work in the industry

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
standard space

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,960
so open chain again another linux

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,120
foundation project

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,159
they're going to be an iso standard

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,200
shortly if

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,840
not done by the time this uh this airs

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,240
and that's really important it gives us

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,559
all

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
a place to look and say okay that's

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,880
consistent

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,559
we can all kind of rotate towards that

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,640
from our practices

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,400
and while it's really focused around the

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,919
legal compliance

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,480
it provides us a framework for

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,520
discussion because again

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,760
ingredients are what's in the mix

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,080
speaking of ingredients so i'm going to

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,720
call it to a friend

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:39,279
everybody likes link i know i like link

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:43,760
maybe i'm dating myself a little bit but

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,720
from a more recent game um

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,279
yeah we all remember if you played

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,960
preston wild

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,000
you couldn't just slam any ingredients

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,960
together and get a good product

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
and unfortunately this didn't poison you

00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
but

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,360
yeah it wasn't what you were looking for

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
you you hopefully we're looking for this

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,360
one

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,679
um and um we all remember where you had

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,640
to go and get the ingredients for that

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,520
um but in general uh we have to care

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,039
about

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,279
where the where the ingredients come

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,120
from uh we see this a lot in the

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,640
eating local so you'll have now

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,760
restaurants saying hey we're a local

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
based restaurant

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,679
that means they're just sourcing

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,600
ingredients from the places around them

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
um and why would you do that

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,720
and a lot of it comes down to the

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,600
freshness

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,200
but it's again that trust concern again

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,919
when you can go and see and you can

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,840
visit a farm and you can look at the

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,559
practices or you can look at the animals

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,480
you can look at the produce

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,640
you're going to feel more confident that

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,559
what you're getting is good

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,480
it isn't something that's your way

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,400
separated from

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,600
so being able to apply those things to

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,360
software is complicated

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
because especially when we look at open

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,159
source one of its

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:04,840
strengths is that it's borderless

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,360
that we have so many individual users

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,440
organizations foundations

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,720
all contributing to create something

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,440
common and awesome

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,640
so throwing the easy one up there on

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,679
kubernetes

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,960
um we should feel proud there's 20

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,799
almost like 2500 plus people

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,000
that have contributed to this and those

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
are the only ones that are recorded on

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
github

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
all those behind the shadows um are not

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,840
listed

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,200
and that's awesome we should all be very

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,600
very proud of that

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,039
um so when we think of it in the context

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,760
of an ingredient

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,000
um is the community active well

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,480
obviously we have so many people playing

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,559
on it

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,080
we have so many pull requests coming in

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,960
to saying hey this is a fix

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,120
or this is some something new um and

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,760
that engagement is very high

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,960
well there's a lot of issues um how many

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
were closed though

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
what's that mean time to close all of

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,159
those

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
you can look at and you can start kind

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,880
of pulling out and saying okay well this

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,520
is this is a community that's vibrant

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
that i can

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,679
in some ways depend on in my supply

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,240
chain

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,600
i can't name a specific developer and

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,919
say because of them

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,679
this project is good it's not a brand

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,520
name type of thing

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,760
but we can look at the characteristics

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,960
of the community

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,480
and decide that hey this looks awesome

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
um several projects that are kind of in

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,559
this space

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,360
and again they're related so chaos um

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,640
the health in characters and health and

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,200
open source

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,840
attributes of open source software sorry

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,679
i completely butchered that

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,120
um the sub foundation that we look at

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,279
the health of communities

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,799
and this isn't just looking at hey i

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,200
have an open source work

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,919
and i need to maintain this work and i

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,840
need to build a community around it

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,320
but it can also be around hey i'm going

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,640
to use this open source work

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,320
um take those same characteristics those

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,600
same attributes and apply them

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,399
almost like a risk lens and say is this

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,760
a vibrant

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:15,120
thing can i depend on this community

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,039
and augur is one of the projects

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,960
that's partially maintained by the chaos

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,520
foundation

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,399
to help kind of pull that data out so

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,080
i'll go out and

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:29,200
look at github it'll aggregate this data

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,919
and help you make some decisions this is

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,399
also an emerging area of

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,600
in the commercial space where you have

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,320
maintenance

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,120
of open source works becoming far more

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,640
critical

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,200
um because the first generation of open

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,399
source

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,880
uh passed a long time ago

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,559
so we may have adopted some apache

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,000
project

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,000
from early 2000s and that's great

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,760
because it saved us from from buying a

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,320
commercial product

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,399
but because that project is not broken

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
we may still be using it

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,320
and it may be in the apache attic well

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,600
how can we surface that

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,679
how can make that available to the

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,559
developers and help nudge them

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,440
potentially to

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,440
an alternative

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,559
so again this is the organizational

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,080
preferences um i tend to kind of call

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,440
this the amazon shopping cart experience

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,120
a lot of people are very familiar with

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
amazon so it makes for a good metaphor

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,559
but it's a little bit of an abstract

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,600
concept what you're looking at is

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,679
metadata

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,320
you have this giant storefront this

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,240
giant warehouse full of stuff

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,480
we don't know what's good and a lot of

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,159
the stuff looks exactly the same

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
i throw a spatula on here just because

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,520
it's fun um

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,159
and that spatula is is awesome by itself

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
but there's

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,600
thousands of spatulas in amazon well

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,960
which one's

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,919
good uh which one's gonna meet my needs

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
and some of that becomes from what we

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,880
see

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,000
and we can see things like star ratings

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,240
we can see that there's

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,279
people answering questions we can see

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,399
there's a badge

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,679
that says amazon's choice and those are

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,840
all indicators

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
to us that hey this is probably a pretty

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,480
good spatula

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,000
it probably will meet my needs i don't

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
know what the cost is

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,600
but maybe this is the one that i should

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,440
get um

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:27,600
and some of this is is organic

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,559
um but some of it is definitely not

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,080
um amazon has a lot of smart people and

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,919
they're trying to steer you

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,600
and that's okay um and we can do that

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,919
along the lines with

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,760
what comes up in our software builds and

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,720
materials

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,720
we want to help our organizations adopt

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,039
similar products

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,320
generate a little bit of consistency

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,080
because if hey we're going to work

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,640
upstream on a project

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,440
well it'd be great to have more people

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,919
work on

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,679
fewer projects because we'll be able to

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,000
materially influence them

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,679
rather than spreading it out and not

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,320
really being able to move the needle on

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,960
any project

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,440
but we also need to be able to to help

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,480
people

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,440
not not by what's

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,120
directly on the menu so you might be an

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,279
angular shop

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,760
and that's great it's still an awesome

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,000
project very well maintained

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,840
but your developers may come to you and

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,399
say hey i want to try react or view or

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,279
spelt um

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,360
okay well we're in angular shop all of

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,559
our knowledge all of our experience may

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,000
be there

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,640
but we shouldn't necessarily be kind of

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,960
single

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,559
single-minded how do we allow our

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,240
developers a little bit of freedom

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,679
have them take some accountability

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,159
because there's some risk

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,279
um if you now have a defect and and

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,000
react

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,200
um and all of a sudden it goes back to

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,480
an angular developer

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,640
that's probably not going to work out

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,960
well

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,000
but if we aren't aware of these things

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
we'll probably

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,519
miss emerging concepts we'll not be able

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,559
to stay up

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,080
we'll increase our technical debt

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,200
so you have to find this balance

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,880
and exposing this type of data around

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,559
who's using what

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,360
how effective was it how supported do

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,720
they feel and can they help support

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,080
use can be really really powerful

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,120
so a lot of times it's building a

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,159
taxonomy building topics

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,279
and allowing for for organic communities

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,440
to grow

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,559
um centers of excellence can be let's

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,200
say a formal way of creating this

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,720
but oftentimes those are almost a

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,480
lagging

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,159
they can't really catch those emerging

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,440
concepts

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,679
whereas a tagging taxonomy can't

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,120
we're gonna if you're subscribed to

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,320
front-end web dev and all of a sudden

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,519
they start seeing

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,120
topics on view well okay maybe i should

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,480
pay attention to this

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,159
um and again that goal is really to

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,440
reduce the amount of variety

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
in focus that allows us as businesses as

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,720
well as

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,839
from our suppliers to maximize those

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,079
relationships

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,079
uh so the basic economy is a scale

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,679
investing upstream um so this is one

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,280
that

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,599
i think a lot of organizations are still

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,639
trying to figure out mine included

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:33,280
um this is maybe the most comfortable

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,720
at least a fidelity budget dollars

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,599
we can allocate those things to

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,280
foundations we can do it on events

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,599
uh through an all things open just

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,320
happened uh last week

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,760
for me and uh here in in raleigh or

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,879
ideally in raleigh

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,599
um we can sponsor events um

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,560
we can work with partners like uh i put

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,040
in tidelift

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,599
and github sponsors which really start

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,359
getting at

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,839
hey how do we how do we help support a

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,480
specific project or specific domain of

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,839
projects

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,960
all those things take money so

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,440
this just helps you direct it some some

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,480
benefits there

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,440
because when we think about investment

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,040
in some of these

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,160
kind of core platforms it generates

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,400
talent it gets our brand out there um

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,440
hopefully folks will be interested in

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,839
coming and talking to us about a job

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,160
as well as it helps to stabilize

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,320
potentially commercial distributions

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,079
or cloud service provider endpoints that

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,960
we source

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,000
that's important because we're all

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,359
depending on those

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,520
at some point time

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,520
um so i think this was actually probably

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,880
from the kubernetes project as well

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,160
um but we can just have our

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,440
our development associates spend mon

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,839
spend their time fixing bugs

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,119
handling issues just being generally

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,480
engaged

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,720
they can do that in something like

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,560
github issues they can do it in stack

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,680
overflow

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,320
they can be focused on documentation

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,040
that's a challenge for every every group

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,520
out there

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,560
and it isn't just your readme it could

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
be a quick start

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,520
it could be an in-depth motivational

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,440
thing it could be an architectural

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,440
decision point

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,359
any of those little document artifacts

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,040
become super valuable to the next

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,800
generation

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,560
as well as those who want to learn from

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,359
the project

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,760
so taking our resources and investing

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,760
that time

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,599
can really make a difference and again

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,160
this bubbles up it flows

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,560
from these open source projects back

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,520
into our commercial supply chain

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,960
so if we open a patch and fix a bug or a

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,680
public cve

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
on an open source work well we're

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,400
probably not the only ones using that

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,760
open source work we probably have

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
suppliers

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,000
that are using that open source work and

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,880
they didn't have that time

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,400
so that bubbles up into their code base

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,119
and helps to protect their code base

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,000
which is

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,040
protecting our data so again there's a

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,599
lot of these

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,160
cascading benefits that we can talk

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,400
about we can wrestle with

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:22,240
and then code so again

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,320
most obvious one for source code is

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,680
open those pull requests um those could

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,560
be bug fixes it could be

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,280
enhancements um but working upstream

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,119
rather than

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,560
almost creating something new and

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,720
sometimes it could be hard for

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
organizations because they want that

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,680
that control and that

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,760
brand awareness but having all the

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,440
organizations work on

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,560
fewer projects can be beneficial

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,320
now again it doesn't come without any

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,760
risk you're always going to be looking

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,079
and making sure that project is the

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,000
right

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,520
one it's going in a good direction so

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,320
neutral governance and all that other

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,680
kind of fun stuff

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,800
forks are a way to handle that um

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,960
but being able to create freedom in your

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,599
development talent to work upstream

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,000
on the actual source code can make a big

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,000
difference

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,720
so here's some kind of next steps

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,240
because this stuff sounds all great and

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,680
everything like that but how does it fit

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,520
where does it fit in my world

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,800
so when you're coming for your product

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,599
review documents

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,280
or maybe you're working with your

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,119
procurement team

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,839
make sure open source supply chain is a

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,839
question you ask

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,440
and be willing to listen and to learn

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,680
and to adapt how to answer and respond

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,280
to that question

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,560
and also when you're creating products

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,320
within reason be able to talk about what

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,160
your supply chain is

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,400
um if you want to put a third party

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,079
notices out there that's great

00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,320
uh in some ways radical transparency

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,359
that's an effective uh an effective

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,880
light

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,000
to shine light and say okay yeah we

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,480
don't want these bugs um

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,079
but on request is is good as well you're

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,240
not legally required

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,640
um in many circumstances especially as

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,400
software as a service to providing this

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,000
type of notice

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,920
but it's community it's a good thing

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,040
and it may help you it may people may

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
make you aware

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,200
of a concern that you were maybe not

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,720
seeing

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,720
uh engaging communities of interest so

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,920
being involved in the things that matter

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,000
to you

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
so if you're a big kubernetes shop and

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,880
honestly

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,280
who doesn't have it on their radar right

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,240
now making sure your

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,920
your talent is also attending in special

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,000
interest groups or working groups or

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,200
user groups

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,040
maybe not leading them day one

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,720
but at least listening getting exposed

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,560
to alternative opinions

00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,520
how are people solving a problem um

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,440
do is this a good problem to have or

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,359
potentially is it an anti-pattern

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,760
one of my favorites is always kind of

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,560
multi-cluster management for kubernetes

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,560
everybody's got an opinion there and you

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,079
want to be able to hear those

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,720
because you're going to land somewhere

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,040
in that in a decision spectrum

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,359
so having a number of people be able to

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,119
kind of talk about that problem

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,440
potentially even writing code or writing

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,599
documentation

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,280
those who have tried to do it and maybe

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,079
not have success

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,000
super valuable make your developer

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,760
experience first class

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,079
this isn't just about tools it's not

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,680
just about githubs or ids or anything

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,079
along those lines

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,920
but when developers are there and

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,160
they're trying to do their day-to-day

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,680
do they feel supported do they feel

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,000
respected

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,560
are they given information so that they

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,240
can make decisions themselves

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,400
on that they can take on risk and

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,079
document that motivation

00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,760
or are they just putting in lines of

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,040
code

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,960
so really thinking through that

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,480
developer experience and trying to

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,920
empower them

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,520
not it's not anarchy um but empower them

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,280
to make good decisions

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,599
um build that accountability and that

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,280
trust inside your organization

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,800
um and when we get to questions

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,599
i'm always up for suggestions on this

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,319
stuff i think it's an interesting topic

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,240
for us all

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,920
to be really wrestling with when you

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,359
think about supply chains

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,359
so just talk about it those could be on

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,359
medium posts it could be wherever

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,040
linkedin whatever your your platform of

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,119
choices

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,720
but really thinking through all the

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,760
ingredients that go into the software

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,200
that we write

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,800
and the software that we use um

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,960
in trying to generate something that we

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,240
can all trust

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,760
i'll leave you with a quote um

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,319
so this was again this is pbs's poison

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,680
squad

00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:01,839
talking about the the situation um

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,480
that spawned up in sinclair's book um

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,480
but

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,160
we all look at things and we see this is

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,599
awesome you can't go to github and not

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,480
be in awe

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,000
of what so many people have created in a

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,520
common place

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,240
i mean it's not perfect but seeing just

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,560
such

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,920
great stuff coming out of it in this

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,119
generation

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,520
um but we need to care we still need to

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,359
to wonder what's inside uh because it

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,000
isn't necessarily good for us

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,599
um so feel free to ask those questions

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,920
stay curious

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:44,400
and you'll make it better for everyone

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,400
