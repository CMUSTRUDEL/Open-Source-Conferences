hi

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,840
and welcome to pioneering open source at

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,360
the cfpb

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
my name is adam scott i'm the web

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
development lead at the cfgb

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
i'll be joined by my colleagues eric

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,320
spry who's our honda operations lead

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,480
jennifer lasseter who's our program

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
operations lead and tim lambert who's a

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,199
senior council in the office of fair

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,439
lending and equal opportunity

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,679
the cfe is a government agency formed

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
after the 2008 financial crisis

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,120
and we were tasked with regulating and

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,360
providing education for consumer

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
financial products in the united states

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,719
um being a new government agency that's

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,239
not something that happens very often so

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
we really had an opportunity to set

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
forward a vision and motivation

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,879
for technology that's modern and

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
innovative

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,719
and a big part of that was thinking

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,199
about how we would integrate open source

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,719
into the bureau's mission and so we set

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,640
forth in those early days with some

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,559
vision and motivation for that

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
to use and create open source software

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,160
that would help us accomplish our

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
mission

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
effectively and efficiently we also

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
thought that

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
since the bureau uses government

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
resources to create source code

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,720
we should provide access to the public

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
to that creation

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
we also believe that open source code

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
provides a public window into how

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
a government agency fulfills its mission

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
to the public

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
and that sharing code could make our

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
products better by allowing us to

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,880
receive and incorporate feedback from

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
the public

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
so we set forth that the bureau opened

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,520
its doors in 2011

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,280
and less than a year later in april 2012

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,960
released a source code policy

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
along with our first two open source

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,920
code repositories

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
six days after releasing those two open

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
source code repositories we received our

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,479
first pull request from a member of the

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439
public

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,119
it was a simple typo fix which is a

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,799
frequent first pull request

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,560
but it was the first time that a

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
government agency had accepted

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
a pull request from a member of the

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,600
public so it felt really groundbreaking

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,280
and exciting that we were onto something

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,799
and so in those early days we took this

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,719
initial approach to open source where we

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
would develop source code in a closed

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,600
environment

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
and then we'd thoroughly vet that source

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
code then potentially release it

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,599
publicly

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
so that's what we saw with those first

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,560
two repositories

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,520
but in the spring of 2013 our team had

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
grown and we really saw an opportunity

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
to start developing the open so to

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
provide that transparency

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
and that vision from the start of our

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,040
projects so that we can encourage that

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
public

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,440
collaboration communication throughout

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,879
the development process

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,000
and you can see here this is our first

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,440
project that was developed in the open

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
and in parallel with that we also

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
started to move our existing source code

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
to the open so we formed an open source

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
working group

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,319
that working group defined a checklist

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
for migrating internal source code to

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,000
our public github and you can see here

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,160
i've linked to that

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
checklist we've made that available and

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
we worked to move our repositories

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,319
to github.com one by one we worked with

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
the maintainers of those repositories or

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,159
that working

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,159
that open source working group

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,599
and that brings us to our approach today

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,879
where we really work in a way that's

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
open source by default

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,200
so rather than develop and enclose and

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
make exceptions where we develop in the

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,159
open

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
we really aim to develop in the open

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,360
from the start as much as possible

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,879
the life cycle for that code looks like

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
this we develop our code

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,480
a developer makes a pull request to

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
integrate that code into our code base

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
and when that happens we run a lot of

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
automated checks both publicly on github

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,319
but also internally

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,879
that check things for security and

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,280
code quality through linting and tests

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,319
we also require a manual review so we do

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
the automated checks

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,840
but also a full-time developer on our

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
team

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,000
does a review of the code and then

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,640
finally we deploy and release that code

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
and this cycle can happen several times

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
a day so this is something that's an

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,879
ongoing process

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
on our team now even though we aim to

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
release things

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,599
as open source by default there are

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
exceptions sometimes the code is just

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
too crude

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,840
it's intended to be a prototype or

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
something that we're doing testing on

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
um other times we may not have the open

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,480
source rights to do something license

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,040
doesn't permit us

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,239
to release it as open source still other

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
times there may be some law or

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,880
regulatory requirements that forbid it

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
or there's security risks by releasing

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
something as open source

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,759
but these really are the exceptions to

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,960
the rule by and large the vast majority

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
of our work is able to be

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,479
released in the open

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
and today we really have taken a varied

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,560
approach to open source so we've

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
really looked at making this a core part

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
of the way we do development and

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
release information uh through

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
technology

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
so we have 299 open source code projects

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
on our public github at this time

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,479
and that includes large projects like

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
our public website or the hmda filing

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
platform which my colleague air will

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,880
speak about shortly

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
we also have things like

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
cross-government initiatives such as

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
interactive regulations which

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,400
we've created and have been forked and

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,160
used by other government agencies

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
we also look to build general purpose

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
projects uh

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
where we're building something for our

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
own use and we think that could be

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,080
extracted and used by the larger open

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,840
source community one example

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,680
is our flag library django flags

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,000
and we also look to use open source

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,240
outside of traditional code models so

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,919
one example is our models for disclosure

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,160
notices which are regular

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,680
regulatory requirement and they help

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
businesses more easily comply with our

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
rules so we release those notices

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
on github and they're available for the

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,400
industry to take

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,240
and use and and build upon and then we

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,560
invest in open source so members of the

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
cfa development team participate and are

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
encouraged to contribute to open source

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,199
products that we use

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
uh for example wagtail which is the

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
content management system that our

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
our website uses two members are our

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
development team we're on the core

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
platform team for wagtail and many

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
members of our development team have

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,360
contributed back to the wagtail

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,560
ecosystem

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,919
uh with that i'll pass it to my

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,199
colleague eric spry who can talk a

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
little bit about the humda platform and

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
how we've leveraged open source

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,360
in that platform

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,400
thank you adam uh it's really

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
fascinating to introduce

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,560
our open source policies and then uh now

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
i'd like to talk about how we've applied

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,919
those policies to a program

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,280
uh the hum to operations program humda

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,400
for short is the home mortgage

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
disclosure act

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,840
which requires certain lenders to

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
disclose who they are lending to and

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
under what terms

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
the honda platform is a regulatory

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
reporting system

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,800
that collects stores and publishes this

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,120
information

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,880
i'm excited to share a bit about how we

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
developed this platform in the open

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,560
and why it matters to the open source

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,440
community

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
so platform development process the

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,160
honda platform was developed in-house at

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,039
the cfpb with an eye towards the future

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,960
of regulation technology

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
by studying pain points that the lending

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,199
industry had with an older process

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,160
we developed a web-based application

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,080
based on insight from filers

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,479
the ideas that came out of our early

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
studies resulted in a pilot application

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
in 2015

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,319
a kind of first draft of the honda

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
filing application

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,520
the platform had an ambitious goal to

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,280
use the bleeding edge technology of 2015

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
that we hoped would be state of the art

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,520
by the time we went into production in

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
january of 2018.

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,000
that strategy worked out and i'll talk a

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,759
little bit more about that later

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
ultimately the work of my team has been

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,520
informed by the engagements we've had

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,039
with our public stakeholders

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,880
and with industry open source

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,720
development

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,560
one of the principles we follow is

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
transparency in the code we write as

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
adam outlined

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,599
this is part of our showing our work and

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
hopefully sharing back to our

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,520
stakeholders

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
the open source code can be used by

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
interested parties to recreate

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
the entire humd platform locally test

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
our code

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
and offer opportunities to suggest

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,800
improvements

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
i'm very proud to say that a number of

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,919
contributions from outside cfpb

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
have become part of the humd platform

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,039
for example

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,599
in the first production rollout of the

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,520
platform someone in the lending industry

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,360
took a look at our code and realized

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
they could make a suggested change to

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
add a new

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,160
helpful validation endpoint that showed

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,960
up as a github pull request

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
my developers reviewed the suggestions

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,599
made a few tweaks

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,560
and incorporated it into our platform

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,440
another example we had a bug in checking

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,760
for a certain loan status flag

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,599
our code had reversed a logical operator

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
for min max values

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,080
deep in the code base causing a problem

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
for a few of our customers

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
one of our industry stakeholders had

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
been digging through the documentation

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
and

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,040
found the inconsistency in the program

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,200
code and submitted a github issue

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,320
this is a very cool catch because the

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,279
fix was

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,680
quick and rapidly deployed as an update

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,519
to the production system

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,839
what i often tell folks when i meet with

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,680
the financial or compliance industry

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,120
is bring your technical people so we can

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,320
talk about apis and code

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,080
api driven architecture

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
apis are important to a lot of the

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,640
lending industry in their compliance

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,240
software

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
and to people who study the lending

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
industry

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
we have great documentation on how to

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
use our apis

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,320
and how to integrate ap humder resources

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,000
into compliance checking process

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
much of that documentation has been

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,680
improved based on industry feedback

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,760
via github issues pull requests and help

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,240
desk tickets

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,399
the honda filing api allows you to work

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,360
with every stage of the honda filing

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
process

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,560
same as the web application

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
the public api is a good one for

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,040
compliance checks because you don't have

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,279
to use a specific user id

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,240
or login so it doesn't require a token

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,519
the hum to data browser apis our data

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
publisher

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
allows you to use filtered and

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839
aggregated data

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
along with csv exports that can allow

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,360
you to build

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
an entire data analysis pipeline without

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,800
the burden of etl

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,240
of the tens of millions of humda records

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
other tools also live in the same

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
platform ecosystem and provide robust

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,720
apis for the industry to use in their

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,640
systems

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,519
technology forward i spoke earlier about

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
starting

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
years back with bleeding edge technology

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
so we could

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
be closer to the state of the art in

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
production

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
some of those important technical

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,160
elements have been

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,079
container based microservices this

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
allows us to scale the platform in the

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,040
right way

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,079
and update specific services without

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,680
causing downtime

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,120
in others as a team dedicated to the

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
humda platform

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
my team focuses on continuous

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,880
improvement and optimization

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,200
and tweaks code to make it better all

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
the time

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,399
one of the ideas that we started with

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,160
the whole program

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,760
the beginning was to connect the

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,079
regulation with our code where possible

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,720
the domain specific language we develop

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,480
for hamda is one such step

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,959
there is a lot of innovation happening

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,680
across industry now that takes this idea

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,959
even further

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
stakeholder engagement

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,920
lastly i'll share that user testing

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,320
engaging with public and industry

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
stakeholders and making improvements

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,200
based

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,480
on feedback are core to the way we like

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,000
to work

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,240
a few examples we heard from compliance

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
vendors that they wanted a way to test

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
their honda systems

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,240
so we created a beta platform for them

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,079
that's open year-round

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
for their testing and continuous

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,040
compliance checks

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,760
our help desk noted that users were

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,079
finding certain error messages confusing

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,720
so we improved error messages to be more

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,880
descriptive and clear

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,200
we've improved our user guides based on

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
user feedback

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
we also heard from a large mortgage

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,480
wholesaler that a

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,079
full file validator would be very

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,519
valuable to them

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,320
so we wrote one and published it

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,000
and lastly we heard from all of our

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,800
customers how the first

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
production filing season went and asked

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
them for

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
ways to improve our system based on that

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
feedback we wrote we wrote a lot of our

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
code

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,399
and improved the performance of the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,240
system

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,600
we accept feedback and suggestions for

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,399
the humd platform

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,160
through industry contacts via hum to

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
help

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,800
cfpb.gov or for your

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,279
technically minded folks through github

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,880
pull requests and issues

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,399
we learn a lot by engaging with our

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
customers and incorporate their

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,680
suggestions and updates

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,720
um to improve the honda platform by

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
sharing our code

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,160
and connecting to our stakeholders we

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,519
have been able to make the humda

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,920
technology better

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
together jen

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,480
thank you eric continuing on the path of

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
open source and innovation at the bureau

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,040
i'm delighted to share details on the

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
cfpb's newly christened tech sprint

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,519
program

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,920
as many of you are aware financial

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,839
regulators have a unique

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
convening power to shape the direction

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,959
of innovation

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,040
both in technology and where wider

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,199
issues persist in the market

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,519
following in the footsteps of the uk's

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,600
financial conduct authority's success

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,680
the bureau has adopted the tech sprint

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
as a key element in our innovation

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,880
toolkit

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,360
in brief summary as i'm sure many of you

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,680
are already aware but in this context

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,399
text prints are referred to as a

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
typically

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
two to five day event that bring

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
together a wide range of subject matter

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,199
experts

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
from across and outside of financial

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,760
services to develop technology-based

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,160
ideas or proof of concepts

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,279
that address specific industry or policy

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,279
challenges

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,639
as many of you also are already aware

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,040
the text front can take on

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
several forms traditional hackathon

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
style

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,320
pre-formed team hackathons and

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
independent work competitions to name a

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
few

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
in all cases the participants are

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
expected to show actionable ideas to an

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,839
evaluation panel

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,839
that have innovated on the presented

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
challenge

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,320
being a data-driven agency it was only

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
right that the first step to kicking off

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,279
the text print program was a public

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,360
request for information in fall of 2019.

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,720
this request was valuable in many ways

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
but especially helpful

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,399
engaging interest from the public and

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
collaborating with the bureau in this

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,120
manner

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,720
and identifying relevant topics for the

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
bureau's first sprints

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,560
by june 2020 the bureau announced the

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,480
first set of sprints and released their

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,399
corresponding problem statements

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,040
and set out to execute the inaugural

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,800
sprint on october 5th through 9th

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
summer was operations heavy with

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,720
planning and recruitment efforts

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,920
we had several adjustments to the sprint

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,600
as you can imagine

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,440
that mirrored the world shifting to a

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,040
fully remote status

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,399
to guide those planning efforts the

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,839
bureau pulled heavily from the

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
previously mentioned work of the

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,760
financial conduct authority

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,519
as well as a meticulously written text

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,360
print manual released by the alliance

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,800
for innovative regulation

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,440
otherwise known as air this manual was a

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,360
companion how to to the fca's efforts

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,360
and in true open source spirit those

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,959
documents are available for anyone's use

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:43,440
on air's website

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,199
october 5th through 9th we did execute

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,639
our first sprint

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,399
virtual i should note including 13 teams

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,880
comprised of various representatives

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,000
from industry community groups academics

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
and technologists

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,040
and globally located the interest in

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,199
terms of volume of applicants was well

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,360
beyond what we had anticipated

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,199
i have several hypotheses for why that

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,040
happened but one of the stronger

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,880
strongest drivers in my opinion was the

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,279
recruitment effort made on behalf of the

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,360
bureau's markets and innovations teams

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,279
they were diligent in making phone calls

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
for pre-registration to validate both

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,720
the problem statement

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
and the value in companies collaborating

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
with the bureau in this way

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,079
we had most applicants come as preform

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
team a sign

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,959
of the remote uh collaboration i believe

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,040
though we allowed for about 15

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,880
individuals to form their own teams

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,839
the week prior to the sprint so i think

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
traditional hackathon style team

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,079
formation

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,680
and some of those folks also joined

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,360
existing teams

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,360
again i believe the summertime calls

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,279
help set the stage for the expectations

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,440
that teams should be multi-disciplined

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,600
and as a result we saw most pre-formed

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,320
teams comprised of multiple companies

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,519
and various subject matter expertise

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,839
it was truly impressive during the week

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,320
the team sprinted independently with a

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
30-minute touchpoint back to the bureau

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,759
this was an adjustment made to

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,919
accommodate the virtual setting

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,839
we anticipated most participants would

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
still be working across the week

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,480
different than in-person execution of

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,480
course and that seemed to be accurate

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,480
in terms of preparation for the week we

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,079
did a one-hour kickoff the week prior to

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
the sprint and allowed for team

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,640
formation

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,079
and problem statement conversations to

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
occur via slack

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,079
across that week as well we also

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,439
provided a tech sprint toolkit with

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
additional reading

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,440
resources such as mock adverse action

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,160
notices and recommended

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
not endorsed a particularly relevant

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
open source data set and model while

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
also

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,760
encouraging teams to use proprietary or

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,760
other open source data sets and models

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,919
friday was a traditional demonstration

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,440
day and we convened an evaluation panel

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,840
that asked questions and scored the

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
demonstrations based on three categories

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,679
creativity effectiveness and market

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
readiness

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,520
the day included opening remarks from

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,120
cfpb director cranninger

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,080
and a keynote speech from nick cook

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,480
director of innovation at the fca

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,480
we are in the midst of post-sprint work

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,559
the hardest and most rewarding steps in

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,720
the process in my opinion

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,640
these follow-up steps include one-on-one

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,559
deep dive meetings between bureau staff

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
and participating teams

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,440
internal bureau discussions around the

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
innovations in their potential

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,160
relationship to future rule making

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
efforts

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,600
potential applications for the bureau's

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
trial disclosure program

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,320
and in some instances innovations are

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,640
already gearing up to go to market

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,480
we hope to have tangible progress to in

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
all of these areas to report back on in

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,360
the following months

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,799
the bureau has several sprints in the

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,280
queue for 2021

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,840
our first as you can see will be held 20

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,280
march 22nd through 26th and focused on

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
the honda platform you heard my

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,679
colleague eric surprise speak to earlier

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,919
i encourage everyone that is interested

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,760
to go to consumerfinance.gov

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,039
and fill out a request for information

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,640
for this sprint

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,160
we'll be starting outreach within the

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
next six to eight weeks and welcome

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,880
everyone that wants to be involved

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,120
into that process and adam i turn back

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,039
to you

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,559
so hopefully you've gotten a sense of

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,039
the

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,559
value and benefits we've experienced

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
through our open source programs both

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,960
the

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,880
general practice as well as how it's

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,080
applied to our humda program as one

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,919
specific example

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
and also how we're taking that and

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,640
building on it with our tech sprints and

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,559
so those

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,160
initial benefits that we explored we've

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,760
seen them play out we've seen that

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,679
this provides an opportunity for our

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,440
industry stakeholders to adopt

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,000
shared code and build directly to our

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,679
regulatory specifications

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,760
it's allowed the public and industry to

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,360
review our source code suggest changes

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,960
and make improvements

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,480
it's also been a signal to advanced

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,280
financial technologists that we

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,200
understand

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
modern technology and development and

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,000
are able and willing to collaborate

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
and we've supported advocates academia

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
students researchers by offering our

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,480
free open access to

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,240
our software and design work and finally

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,280
it's enabled this cross-agency

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,360
collaboration

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,120
and really given us a jump start on on

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
our work so we've been able to share

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,480
our work with other government agencies

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,760
and build on the work of

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,840
our partners in government

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,520
and this is just one step on our journey

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
you can see we've come a long way in the

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,919
past

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
several years but there's a long way to

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,919
go so i encourage you to reach out

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,440
if you're a part of this open source

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,200
journey within your organization you'd

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,880
love to talk and hear more about your

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
experience and share our own

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,200
thank you

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,840
thank you

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
