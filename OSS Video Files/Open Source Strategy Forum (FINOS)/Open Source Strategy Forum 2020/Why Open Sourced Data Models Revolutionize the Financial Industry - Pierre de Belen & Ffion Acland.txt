thank you for joining us at this session

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,360
today

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,960
i'm theon ackland i've been at goldman

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,040
sachs for 10 years

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,199
and i currently manage our london data

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
models team helping to build the data

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,160
models

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920
for our global markets business prior to

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
that i spent six years

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,199
in the middle office supporting our

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
credit derivatives deaths

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,000
from everything operational

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
hopefully you're able to tune in to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
pierre's keynote session

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,920
earlier in this conference where he took

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,719
us through the technology behind legend

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,719
and the recent open sourcing of the code

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
in this session we want to dig a little

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
bit deeper into one of those use cases

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
specifically the derivatives one that

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,360
pierre took you through

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
also there are two other things that we

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,760
want to call out during this session

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,680
one is to discuss the opportunities

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,360
beyond the derivatives use case

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
of where we could collaborate as an

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,079
industry and build data standards

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,280
and finally we want to explore how you

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
can get involved

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,439
in legend and using it to enhance

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
perhaps your own

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
environments or also the industry as a

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
whole

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,799
so before we get started a couple of

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
notes pierre and i will both be

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,759
available during this session to answer

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,920
questions

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
and you will notice alloy on the screen

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
right now but in the next code release

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
this will be updated

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,240
to legend so doing a little bit of a

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,479
deeper dive into the use case

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
than the derivatives use case for the

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,000
last four years

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
we've been working with isda and other

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,720
industry participants

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
on the development of the common domain

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
model

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,520
or the cdm as you may be aware of it and

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
when we were looking to

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
open source legend we wanted to make

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
sure that we were really going to add

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,520
value back to the industry

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,360
not just demonstrate it as a tool and as

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
a functionality

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
so the cdm felt like a great place for

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,000
us to position the pilots

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
and with the support of ista regnosis

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
and through finos

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
we were able to set up two working

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,719
groups

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,000
the first one looked at developing and

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
enhancing the current

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
code available for fx options and the

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,200
second

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
looked to actually build a brand new

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,480
payout in order to be able to define

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,879
commodities products

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
last month we successfully committed

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
code back

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:29,040
to the cdm and this was a big milestone

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
for many of us in the project showcasing

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,720
how legend was able to help us to

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,080
continue to build and develop together

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,800
in collaboration with the

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
industry and translate that code back

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
into the rosetta form

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
in order to be able to submit that to

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,480
the golden source

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
some of the functions that we found

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,200
really helpful during this collaboration

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
were the diagrams and i will showcase

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,400
that a little bit later in a

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,920
demonstration

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
one of the things that came out of the

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,840
pilot that we felt would be even more

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
beneficial for collaboration

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
was the idea of a notes page bit like a

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
sticky note

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
where you may just want to jot down some

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
ideas to come back to as a group

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
or even put it out there for someone

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
else to try and solve a particular issue

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,879
that you were working on

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,360
i'll also demonstrate that as we go into

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,599
the next section

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
as a second part of the demonstration i

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,840
also want to show you some of the

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,560
extended functionality within legend

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,720
mainly the validations the model to

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
model mappings or transformations of

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,599
data

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,360
and then how we can test this to

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,360
demonstrate the compilation of the code

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
finally we'll look at how we actually

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
commit this code back

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,720
and the sdlc functionality that is

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
available through gitlab

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,760
to ensure that we have governed commits

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,519
and we avoid any conflicts

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
so let's get started with our

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
demonstration hopefully you can all see

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
my screen

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
so we are going to use the cdn i just

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,239
spoke about

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
as part of the demonstration and this is

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,319
available in the external version

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,360
of legend so if you choose the project

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:12,239
you can then create your own workspace

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,560
so for this i will call it lf demo

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,639
and hit create once that's ready for you

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,639
you can hit next to open your workspace

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
and now we're all set so you can see on

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,600
the left hand side here

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
that we have the cdm available to us if

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
we open these drop downs you can

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,600
actually see the model

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
and for those of you that are familiar

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,040
with the cdm some of these classes you

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
will recognize

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
for those of you who aren't these are

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
just all the classes that have been

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,360
built

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
to define derivatives products and

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
within each class there'll be

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,800
multiple properties and we'll show you

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,479
some of those

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
a little bit later on when i started out

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,680
i mentioned this idea of

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,960
diagrams so let's have a look at one of

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,240
those

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,160
so this is a diagram of payouts payouts

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,039
is how we define products

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
in the cdm and the idea is that they are

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,440
building blocks

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,160
to defining a product overall so

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,680
in this version you can see the entire

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,080
class of payout

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,880
and you can see that we have other

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
classes

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
coming off of this you can zoom in and

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
out

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,280
using the scroll button on the mouse and

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,280
you can also move it around

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,720
using the right hand click button

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,720
you'll notice when you zoom it you

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
actually focus on the center of the page

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
so if you move it around you can then

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,039
zoom into other parts

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,400
of the diagram as you wish

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,400
to collapse the diagram very simple

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
you can click on the class and hit

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
delete so i can do this across all of

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
them

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,360
and as i do you'll notice that it pulled

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,440
back

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,440
into the original class

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
i could also go into the model and start

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
to pull

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
those payouts back out again so if we go

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
and have a look for the interest rate

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
payout

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
if i drag this back into the diagram we

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
will see it removed from within the

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,240
class

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,360
and connected by line with all of the

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
details within itself

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,720
next i want to show you how to use the

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,199
sticky note so

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
in here we can quickly and easily click

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,520
the plus

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
we have a choice of things to create and

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
we are going to use a few of these a

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
little bit later

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,639
but the one i want to bring your

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,000
attention to now is this new text

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
so if we call it to do

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
within this we can just type some things

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,160
down that might help us

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,120
in the future so from those payouts we

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,240
may want to do

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,680
a few extra things we may want to

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
change the name of a property

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,280
we may also want to combine

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
the equity payout and the commodity

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,160
payout

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,599
into an asset payout and this is

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,840
actually what happened

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,840
as part of one of the finos pilots

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,199
you will see that our to-do does find

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,840
its way

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,840
into the list the left-hand side here as

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
well

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,520
so we have a to-do list how about we

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,960
give it a go

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,199
to do the actual first one on our list

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,199
so if we go back to our diagram you'll

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
notice it's here in the left hand

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,800
but also since i've already picked it up

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,800
you will see it in this top

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
panel for a quick and easy navigation

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,639
and if we double click on the payouts

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
here it will open up on the right hand

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,199
side

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
such that we can see the properties

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,759
within that class

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,440
and edit them directly so the first

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
item on our to-do list was to change

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,039
equity payouts

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
to asset payouts hopefully as you can

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
see from that

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
nice and easy to make that change if i

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,720
wanted to add

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,560
a new property i just hit the plus here

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,200
and i can equally remove it

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,599
using the x what i wanted at this point

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,839
is show you the compilation of the code

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
now in this scenario i am expecting it

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,320
to provide us an error

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,399
because the asset payout or as was

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
previously called the equity payout

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
is in other parts of the code and so by

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
trying to compile now

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
it is likely to fail but we will go

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,839
through it to show you

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
right hand side

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,480
but it's also brought up the code in the

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,480
background so for those of you

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,399
who are more comfortable with coding

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
directly this is all happening in the

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
background and you could update directly

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:23,839
in here

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:23,839
but if we hit f8 it will take us back

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,000
great so now i want to take you through

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,120
to some of the more extended

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
functions available within legend and to

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,600
do this

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
we're going to have a look at one of the

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,240
classes called fx

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:53,120
haircut currency

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
this is a class that has two properties

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,399
one

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,200
is is termination currency and the other

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,079
fx designated currency

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,440
basically for this class it is defining

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,560
which currency we use

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
for the haircut if it's the termination

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,079
currency then

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
this is termination currency attribute

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,600
would be true

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,000
and if this was false then we would be

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,079
able to specify a currency

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
that we would want to use you can see

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,800
that this is termination currency is

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,839
boolean

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,440
and is mandatory whereas the fx

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,240
designated currency is an

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
optional field and this class actually

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,160
has a few constraints

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,120
on it for those of you who are familiar

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,839
with code

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
you might already be able to see um a

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,079
discrepancy here

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,959
so we have a validation of one of

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,519
constraint

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
which is saying that you must have one

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
of

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,279
these however you can notice that the is

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,040
termination currency is mandatory

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,640
and therefore we're always going to have

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,279
two um

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
so this is actually obsolete but i am

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,160
going to leave it here

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
um so that when we come through to the

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,480
tests we'll be able to demonstrate

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,000
that the tests do fail and we can

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
resolve it at that point in time

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
so to run the tests what we'll do is

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,880
also generate

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
a model to model mapping now this is

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
something that would help

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,560
you if you were looking to map perhaps

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,720
between proprietary data models

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,959
and industry standards or even

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,880
internally between your own data models

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,519
you could do this model to model mapping

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,519
in legend

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,360
so for us to make a start we are going

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
to create a new package

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,320
and i'm going to call this one target

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,320
haircut

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,839
and within target haircut i'm also going

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,839
to create a new class

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,519
so as you can see i've been going

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
through nice and easy to navigate adding

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
new

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,839
items and now we have a new class i can

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,399
add the new properties

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,160
so on my internal model i'm also going

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,959
to have two properties

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,160
but i'm going to call the first one use

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
termination currency

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,720
and specified currency

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,079
i'm going to leave both of my attributes

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
as string

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,200
but i will make the specified currency

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
optional

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,560
given we won't always need it

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,360
so how do we map between these two

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
again to add an item just in our

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,680
drop-down list

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,680
add a new mapping

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,440
i'm going to call this mapping haircut

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,200
now we have the ability to add the

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,760
target class and also the source class

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
so if we add the target class first this

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,600
is our

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
target haircut

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,240
and here on the right hand side we can

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
add our source

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,920
which is the one from our cdm model

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
which is

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,839
fx haircut currency

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
so in the middle you can see it's

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,079
already pulled in our properties

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,959
from our target class and on the right

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,800
hand side

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,480
the two properties that are available to

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,120
us from the source

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,680
class are ready to go so we can drag and

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
drop these

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,160
to demonstrate the mapping now you may

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,639
remember that actually

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,680
the is termination currency is actually

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,440
a boolean

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:49,839
so we need to do a conversion of that

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,839
into a string

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,480
so

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
now you will have noticed as i was

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
typing there that there is a red error

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,680
box

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,839
just below this will be there until you

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,079
have written a logical statement

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
in the code and that's very helpful for

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,079
those who are perhaps not so

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,800
technical in the coding languages

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,120
so we now have a logical transformation

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,360
from our is termination currency to

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,600
use termination currency and our

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
specified currency and fx designated

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,760
currency

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,720
should work as they are so let's start

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,720
building some tests

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,839
so we want to test our new target

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,839
currency class

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,839
so here we can build some data so

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,959
is termination currency i'm going to

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,560
start with false

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:04,959
such that we can specify a currency

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,959
let's go for gbp for these purposes

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,839
and we can generate an expected result

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,839
and i'm expecting this to fail

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,720
so it's actually failing because we

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,839
haven't actually changed

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,839
our equity payout back so as i mentioned

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
previously

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
when we did our compilation this asset

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,199
payout

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,519
was in other places so if we change this

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,519
back

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
and this demonstrates that the entire

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,759
time

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,759
the the code is compiling

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,040
and that helps us to avoid conflict in

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,360
data as we go along

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
so we now have another error this is the

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,320
one related

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,279
to our constraint so that one-off

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
constraint

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
that we mentioned earlier so nice and

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,959
easy way for us to

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,199
fix this one if we go back to our

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,440
haircut currency class

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,800
and into the constraints we can just hit

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
the x to remove it

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,399
now if we try and generate an expected

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,199
outcome

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,759
excellent so now we have an expected

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,320
outcome we can see the conversion of our

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,480
code

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
so is termination currency of false has

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
mapped to no

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,519
and we've now received our specified

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,560
currency of gbp

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,040
because of that i also now want to

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,079
create

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
a test so that we can test true in this

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,600
scenario

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,600
so to add a test i just click the plus

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
button

00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:01,199
i'm going to leave this one as true

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,800
and let's go for usd this time around

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,880
although when i try and generate this

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,600
expected result i'm again expecting to

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,919
receive an

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,919
error

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,319
and that is because when is termination

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
currency is true

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
we should be using the termination

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,880
currency and therefore

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,400
should not be specifying another so

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,840
in this case we actually need to remove

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,840
the additional piece of data from our

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
source

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,520
and now we have an expected result with

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,360
our use termination currency of

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,840
yes and our specified currency as null

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,760
so we have two tests available as you

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,000
can see as we built those tests the

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,039
validations that we expected to fail

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
were failing

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
and therefore we were able to

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,520
demonstrate those and now we can

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,720
actually run

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,919
our two tests here so to run the tests

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
you can hit the play button

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,240
so we have one test passed and we'll

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,120
just do

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,120
the second one as well

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,880
and our second test is past two so we've

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
now been able to demonstrate

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,559
a check of the validations i've managed

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
to also show you

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,640
how the compilation runs in the

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,919
background the entire time such that if

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,919
anything is changed

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,240
even if not directly to the code you're

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,440
working on it will also throw an error

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,360
where necessary

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
and we've managed to test our model to

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,600
model mappings between

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,520
two classes and show those to be able to

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,200
pass

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,880
if this was where we were and we were

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
complete with what we wanted to

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,559
do today we could then go and submit

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,760
this

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,640
back through the sdlc now there is sdlc

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,679
that sits within

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,400
git lab so each submission and commit

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,840
goes through gitlab but you are able to

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,280
do that directly

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,120
from legend so the changes

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,200
are tracked everything that we've done

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,160
today and i could go through

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,280
and submit these once i've submitted

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,559
people could go in

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,559
and also approve them and once approved

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,799
they could be merged back in

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,799
so all of that can be run directly from

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,760
the ui it can also be done

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,760
by gitlab as well

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
so that's everything we wanted to show

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,559
in the demo

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,679
hopefully that's given you a taste of

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,760
what you could achieve by using the tool

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,120
and some of the benefits in terms of how

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
we use it in the industry for

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,200
collaboration

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,039
as well so the other two parts of this

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,280
session we wanted to cover

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,679
where what other opportunities are there

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,440
beyond this cdm use case for us to

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,080
collaborate in the industry

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
and use legend as a tool to accelerate

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
those industry standards

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,440
so there are a couple of projects

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,840
already running one of those

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,799
is the finos securities reference data

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
project

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,240
and this is one that was set up actually

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
on the back of the

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,039
fx options pilot where we

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,960
found that it'd be really helpful to

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,159
have an industry standard

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,919
around fx currencies and so there was

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,440
one that had started up was in

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,360
relatively early stages

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,960
and they are now looking to use legend

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,559
in their data modeling

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,480
going forwards other places so

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,400
finos also have a financial object

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,039
project where they would want to be

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,559
trying to

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,960
solve specific problems in the industry

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,240
now this could be within the derivative

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,400
space already

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,360
continuing to develop the cdm as we have

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,120
already demonstrated over this last year

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,640
it could also be looking at other areas

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
and other problem statements

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
that could be in new products it could

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
be different parts of a life cycle such

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,120
as the quoting

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,559
or it could be specific issues in the

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,400
processing that we can identify today

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,960
another option is to go beyond

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
financial data specifically and actually

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,000
look at other strands of data within the

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,600
industry

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,080
there's obvious ones around reference

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,440
data perhaps or market data

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
another that we looked at also was

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,159
actually esg data

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,919
so as part of the pilot we started to

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,039
explore this it was decided

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,600
that it was probably going to be a

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,679
bigger project than we could tackle

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,679
within the time frame that we wanted to

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,200
but during those discussions it was

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,640
definitely identified

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
that it would be a helpful place for us

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,559
to start to standardize

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
industry data in this space and so

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,799
perhaps that's another place

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,480
we could continue to develop some new

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,840
features that are coming

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,400
into legend that should also help to

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,400
bring extra benefits in this space so

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,360
the mapping to databases

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,440
so giving access to real data such that

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,720
you could start to integrate that into

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,400
your processes and into your systems

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,880
this way we'd really realize the

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,039
benefits available in terms of industry

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,400
standards and communicating

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,799
in data supporting flat

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
data sources so the idea that we could

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,039
output a csv

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,919
file for instance and automated code

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,679
generation

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,760
so i did mention at the beginning that

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
we were able to translate the code

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,159
from the legend language to rosetta in

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,120
order to submit that back as part of the

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
pilots

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,400
that will be available coming soon

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,000
and it will also give us the opportunity

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,640
to add other languages

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
into that translation so you could use

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,000
it for

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,600
proprietary language transformation or

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,640
other languages that are available in

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,640
the industry as well

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,640
and finally let's explore how you can

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,440
get involved

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,280
and use legends as we go forward the

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
first one is contribution

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,559
so legend is now open source that

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
happened last month

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,080
so you can contribute directly through

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,880
the github

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,280
legend repositories you could go in and

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
raise

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,120
issues or comments on current code that

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,039
people are working on

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,400
will raise issues just that you think

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,600
should be resolved

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,600
if you couldn't go and resolve it

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,400
yourself another space is the doc site

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,120
this is actually where new people who

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
are looking to

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,440
onboard onto legend can go and get

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,919
demonstrations similar to today

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
but in different parts of the system as

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,559
well

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
and you could go in and improve that

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,159
document site as you start to

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,320
use it and play around

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,240
secondly collaboration we've touched on

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,279
this i guess in the use case and also

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,640
just recently

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,480
but you could get involved in

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,360
collaboration that's ongoing in the

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,880
industry

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,559
perhaps there's some current efforts

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
that are of interest to you and you

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,200
could get involved in those groups

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
and influence industry standards or

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,919
suggest

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,279
and push new industry standards so where

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
there's places that you think there

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,720
would be benefit

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,640
to actually build a working group get

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,799
some industry participants together

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
and start working in legend to improve

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,760
that

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,159
and finally adopting legend on premise

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
so this is where people start to really

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,600
gain those benefits of that model to

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,919
model mapping that i demonstrated

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,600
being able to generate your proprietary

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,000
models in the system

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,640
and map those to some of the industry

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,120
standards

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,919
that are already available you could

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,640
also as i

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,720
mentioned before start to map between

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,320
your own internal data models perhaps

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,080
and that would help in translation and

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,080
processing of data in other ways

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,520
so thank you for your attention through

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,440
this session today

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,039
as i mentioned pierre and i are both

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,039
available for questions

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,559
right now and we'd love to continue a

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,559
discussion on any of the points

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,039
i have touched on or also that pi

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,760
mentioned in his keynote speech

00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:01,200
please do follow up with us and thank

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:03,279
you for attending

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,279
