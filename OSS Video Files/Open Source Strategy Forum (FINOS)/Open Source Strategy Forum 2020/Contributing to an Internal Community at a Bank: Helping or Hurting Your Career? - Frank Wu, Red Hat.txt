hello everybody

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
my name is frank wu and this is my

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,880
lightning talk around contributing to a

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,240
community at a bank

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,560
does it help or hurt your career

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,160
so first a little bit about myself what

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,119
i'm about to say is my personal

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
opinion um it does not reflect the my

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,080
employer

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
who is red hat and i am based in new

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,640
york city

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,160
focusing on supporting large financial

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
services institutions

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
but have a history of working with

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,079
various open source technologies

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,000
including open source databases as well

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
as in the data center infrastructure

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,399
space

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,000
before we begin about building a career

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
at a

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
bank i thought it's important to

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,440
understand the history of baking and

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
really the scale of how technology has

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
developed at the banks

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,360
one of the stories that's resonated with

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,760
me was when i had a customer tell me how

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,320
facebook in the early days and all the

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
other quote unquote web scale companies

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,840
made the trek from california to new

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
york city to really

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
look to understand how the banks

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
operated at scale

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
because this is something that a lot of

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
folks know

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,759
most likely attending but you know the

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,119
banks have been operating at scale for

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,560
decades

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,400
employing tens of thousands of

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,960
developers running code across

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
hundreds of thousands of servers the

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
interesting thing about how the banks

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
have operated was from a historical

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,759
perspective

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,680
a lot of this was done mostly on

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,560
proprietary and homegrown

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,200
tooling and to build a career within the

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
bank

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,439
a lot of times the path to building a

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,759
path to a distinguished engineer

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,799
was to contribute custom code or

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
maintain

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
part of the technology that enabled the

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
bank

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
to advance one's career it wasn't

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
necessarily about

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
sharing or collaborating with other

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,240
groups but rather

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
you know controlling a particular

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
technology or contributing to a

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
particular homegrown technology

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,399
that enabled the bank to do their

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,280
business activities

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
so what's changed well this is the open

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
source strategy forum so i think it

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,599
comes

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
to no surprise to everybody that the

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,160
growth of open source has risen

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,239
dramatically

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,319
not only has the rise of open source

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
been around community open source but

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,480
also enterprise open source

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,640
and the decline of proprietary software

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
the growth of open source has touched

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,000
all parts of the stack

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,160
it's no longer just the operating system

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,400
where linux is fairly pervasive

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,680
but it touched the database world the

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
analytics space

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
as well as security and cloud management

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
another thing that has changed

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,440
fundamentally compared to decades before

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,519
has been the rise of public clouds

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,560
whereas previous i.t workers

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,160
were always working in a walled garden

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
so to speak

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
operating in the bank's homegrown kind

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
of enclosed

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,879
environment today that bank employee

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,800
on the weekend may have access to

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,680
on-demand computing resources

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,760
in a plethora of tools and technologies

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
and think to himself or herself

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,959
hey why can't i use this tool or

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,599
technology

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,599
at my day job it works pretty well

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,959
so thinking about the framework of

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,560
growing one's career

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
the way i think about building an

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
internal community at a bank

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,640
is really around the idea of bringing on

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,799
board a new technology to the bank

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,959
typically a open source technology

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,360
that's not necessarily supported

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
and not part of the corporate standards

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
and you really have to look at the

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
trade-offs on the left side and the

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,120
right side

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
on the left side when you bring on board

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,840
a new technology you really have to

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,760
consider

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,879
does this technology solve an immediate

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
business problem

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
does my ed or md have a particular

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
deliverable

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,000
and bring on board this new technology

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
uh close that gap

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
that exists today and that gap may be

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
budgetary it may be

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
a function of the product are there

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
others within the bank that have the

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,519
same problem

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000
where this is something that could be

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
repeated and moreover are there others

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,959
in the industry in the financial

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
services industry

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
also looking at evaluating these new

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,080
choices with the growth of

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,760
these different open source options the

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
other side of the trade-off

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,799
you really have to wonder does it really

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
make sense

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,560
to bring in yet another technology or

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
choice

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
in all the options that exist today just

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,000
given the significant level of effort

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
to integrate into existing systems and

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
really this is an important question i

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
pose to engineers

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
is is this about a technology solving a

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,720
business problem

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
or is it about politics and religions in

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,520
the sense that

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,000
you may not like the corporate standard

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
because it's based on a particular

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
coding language

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,320
such as java for example and you really

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
like

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
haskell or erlang and that's why you

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
want a database built around those

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,840
programming languages

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
that's not really valid enough

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
so thinking how building a internal

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
community around a new open source

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
technology

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
that you're bringing to your company you

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
really have to think and understand

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
who you're interacting with and how

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
you're solving problems

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
in a typical traditional hierarchy of

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,520
the bank you have the eds dmds

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,360
svp cpos and so on and you'll see that

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
as the higher up you go within

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,120
the hierarchy the longer the time

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,440
horizon is

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,039
at the lower level someone may care that

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,759
this technology can solve a particular

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,680
problem

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
but at the higher up that's where this

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,479
technology becomes more

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,479
strategic and building an internal

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,840
community may actually benefit the

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,280
company in ways that you may not

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,919
anticipate

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,840
at the highest levels what's really

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,360
important to the bank is around talent

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,120
around attracting and retaining and

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,840
managing people and

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
understanding how you keep the top 20

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,360
performers engaged and

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
perhaps stimulated you know if you build

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
a community around

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
the latest machine learning or

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
artificial intelligence tooling

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,840
you know that may really benefit the top

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
20 performers

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,120
and decide and have them stay at the

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,080
bank as opposed to go to

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
facebook or google to work on the other

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
side of the coin

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,319
there's also a question around how do

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
you leverage and optimize

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
the bottom eighty percent right um the

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
eighty percent

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
may not necessarily be um the the most

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,639
rock star programmer but

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,199
they can contribute a little bit to the

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
overall

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,479
knowledge of the bank into the community

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
and there's 10

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
000 of them and they all contribute a

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
little bit

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,759
that makes a significant shift for the

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,319
bank

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,240
so let's talk about a real world story

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,880
this presentation isn't about ansible

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,919
animation but the example is

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,160
one common problem that banks often have

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,280
is around integrating various domain

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,960
specific tooling

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,880
and specifically around use cases such

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,599
as disaster recovery or

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,759
application resiliency right oftentimes

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
the technology is not the problem

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039
the problem is around the manual

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
coordination and hanover

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,319
between the two different groups because

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,800
there's a dependency on the database

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
side

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,080
but perhaps a dependency on the

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
networking side right

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,240
given the size and scale that banks

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
operate it's simply untenable

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,039
for everyone to be consolidated under

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,039
one big devops group or cloud groups

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,440
so it's really around how can i

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,199
coordinate and orchestrate the different

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
workflows across these different

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,919
disparate groups

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,960
and technologies for those who are not

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
familiar

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,479
ansible automation is a great use case

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
and tool for this type of problem ansibo

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,759
is probably one of the most popular

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,919
automation frameworks and language in

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
the world it's designed to be very

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
simple

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,599
based on yet in their markup language

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
where anybody

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,039
if they're a linux admin an application

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
owner

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,879
a firewall administrator can understand

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,520
the automation syntax

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,520
based on yaml and its agentless which

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,479
means it's a very simple and lightweight

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,879
technology

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,560
enabling the stitching of all these

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,560
despair technologies

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,000
so at one bank there was once a java

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
developer that hated

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
waiting for his jvm to restart and

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
he knew from a technical perspective it

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,919
did not take five to six hours

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
for that jvm to restart but he had to

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,800
wait

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,720
five to six hours in order to get access

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,199
for that jbm to restart

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,240
and he decided to bring on board a new

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
technology

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,000
one that was based on open source at the

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,319
time called ansible

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,520
with the support of a managing director

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
he was able to help

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,360
integrating parts of this technology to

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,680
their homegrown system

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
and start a little community and really

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,919
build a coalition of various

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,080
stakeholders with their own use cases

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,200
ranging from networking to application

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,519
owners

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
um today that internal community as a

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
bank

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
has grown by leaps and bounds and

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
there's a massive

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,519
global community of 5 000 users from

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,959
india

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,640
ohio the us the uk

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
where they're all writing code and

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,320
reusing that code and sharing it

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
across the different lines of businesses

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,839
and groups

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,000
moreover there's a great internal

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,360
community chat room based on symphony or

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,760
other chat tools where if a new user

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
has questions around this technology the

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
product owner of the bank

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
doesn't actually have to explain what

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,480
the technology is

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
but rather other users of that service

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,839
that part of the community

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
can help answer that q a

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,279
so going back to the question you know

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
does building an internal community of

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,000
the bank

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,320
benefit your own personal career or not

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,560
this is a slide that really shows

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
uh if it does right and whether or not

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,959
you can reach that inflection point

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
at the far left side at level one you'll

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,080
see

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
the effort to make change is very very

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
high and

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,640
the eternal community benefits are low

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
and this is a challenging time because

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,120
you may be an individual contributor

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
that's passionate about technology and

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
that you know will solve a lot of

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
problems at the bank

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,279
but you have your day job you have your

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
deliverables and it's very hard to

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
affect

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,440
change as an individual and effort level

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,839
is very high

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
but as you start progressing forward to

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,640
the right

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
you see as you build a community you

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
start standardizing how that technology

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
is brought in

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,959
and as new users want to use that

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
technology you can explain hey this is

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,320
how i work for security

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,640
to get this done this is how i worked

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
with compliance and the inflection point

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,000
is really around level three

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
right and where community is

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
self-sustaining this is where

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
you as an individual don't have to do

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
all the care and feeding

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,560
but rather the community itself is

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,600
self-sustaining

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,040
and can help onboard new users based on

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,040
other uh their own individual use cases

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
level four is really where it becomes

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
institutionalized it's where the cio and

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
the cto look down and

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
they see this grassroots coalition of

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
stakeholders all

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
using this new technology to solve real

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,440
business problems

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,880
and they formally institutionalize it

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
across the enterprise

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,640
and across various teams and at the far

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,320
right side

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,560
is really where you see this idea of

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,320
federated community driven development

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,600
where folks at the grassroots level are

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
rapidly prototyping

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
experimenting new ways to use that

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
technology and if it's

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,880
successful they re-share and use that

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
knowledge across different lines of

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
groups

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
and businesses at the bank as opposed to

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,440
a top-down approach

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
where you have a committee made indeed

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
mandating to you

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
how to use that technology

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,279
the last law i would like to close on is

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
oftentimes when you meet with

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,440
individuals they often tell you

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,399
their job title they say i'm an engineer

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,040
i'm an architect

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,079
i'm an assist admin but when you think

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
about it

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,079
a lot of times what you do from a job

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
title perspective is only 10

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
of what you do and ninety percent of

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
what you really do

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
is work with people and if you're gonna

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
try to optimize something

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,200
that you know helps improve your life or

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,360
perhaps

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,440
the business of the company you work for

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,120
why not focus on the ninety percent

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
and that ninety percent is really around

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:08,560
building communities

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:08,560
