hi

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,200
thanks for joining my talk bots chat ups

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
covid

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,240
and the symphony java toolkit i'm also

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,199
going to talk about hackathons workflow

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,480
agile github and open source as we go

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
and hopefully i'll be able to tie all

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,279
that together into some consistent hole

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,960
but you can be the judge of that and i

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
know that this might be a confusing

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,800
bunch of disparate keywords but

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,480
over the next few minutes i'll unpack

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,760
all those and hopefully you'll see how

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
they all fit together

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
so let's start with symphony uh this is

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,760
a screenshot from symfony it's a chat

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,200
platform

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,960
i'm imagining that lots of people here

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,559
today are very familiar with chat

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
platforms now and use them in their

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,960
day-to-day work

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
and this is slack it's pretty similar to

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,399
symphony maybe you're familiar with that

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
you've got your chats down the left hand

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
side and the box at the bottom for

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,120
entering text

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,559
and this is microsoft teams and again

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
it's the same kind of layout i guess you

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
could say there's a lot of

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,840
convergent evolution going on here all

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
these platforms share a lot of the same

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
features

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
and we'll talk about some of these

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
features as we go

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,200
and you might have even seen this in the

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,400
press lately about how the guy guys

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,479
building slack

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
are trying to sue microsoft over exactly

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,680
that issue

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,119
not only is teams similar to slack but

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,759
they're trying to push teams out to

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,280
everyone

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,840
they're using their dominance of office

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,159
tools to try and muscle in on slack's

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,080
territory

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
and here is a google trends chart of

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,439
those two

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
as you can see teams is now a lot more

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,200
popular as a search term than slack

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
which explains why slack guys are

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,079
getting mad now what's really

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
interesting to me at least is what

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,000
happens in march

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,840
suddenly teams gets this huge boost and

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,680
slack gets a smaller one

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
loads more people are using it and i'm

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,439
pretty convinced this is

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,040
kovid related it ties into when we all

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,439
started to work from home

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
somehow microsoft got a big covered

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
related uptick here which

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,119
really helped their notoriety now

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,079
symphony isn't on this graph symphony is

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,200
a kind of a small

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,880
player when compared to slack and teams

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
it's super specific to the finance

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
industry and it has a really good market

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
share there

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
the reason being it has a much better

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
story with regards to compliance and

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
security

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
which is something that banks and

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,480
financial regulators are really keen on

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,920
at deutsche bank we saw the same things

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
in this chart the number of messages

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,640
going over symphony since about march

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
has doubled and that makes sense people

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
can't communicate

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
face to face anymore obviously covert

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,680
has changed the way we work

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
and teams and slack and symphony they're

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,840
the kind of tools we use to interact

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,840
with each other now

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
uh so let's let's just change tac now

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
this is the the manifesto for agile

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
software development it's a website from

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,800
about 20 years ago

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,319
and i expect most of the people at this

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
conference are going to know what agile

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,519
software development is basically the

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
guys who came up with the agile

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
manifesto were unhappy about the way the

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,040
software got built in the 90s

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,959
and they wanted to throw out the big

00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
project plans and the big upfront design

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
and so on

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,760
and try and build software in a more

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
collaborative exploratory way

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,879
this has had a massive impact on

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
software development and i'm going to

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,080
run through a few

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
agile practices now really quickly

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,599
because i know everyone's just going to

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
be

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
nodding along to these they know what

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
they are and i want to get onto the good

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
stuff

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,640
but there are four main statements in

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
this manifesto here and the one i want

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,080
you to keep in mind is the first one

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
individuals and interactions over

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
processes and tools

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
so here are a bunch of beautiful people

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
having a stand-up meeting in their

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
office

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
this could well be a photo taken at

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
deutsche bank in 2019

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
everyone stands up to keep the meeting

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
short these are individuals having

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,239
interactions

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,799
over processes and tools now if i'm in

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,560
a meeting now no one knows whether i'm

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,159
standing up or lying down

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
the other thing about stand-up meeting

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,080
is that it forces you to concentrate

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
but on a conference call or a zoom chat

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
like this one i might be present

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,120
but engaged in some other task on my

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
computer and if i'm

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
present but i'm not really paying

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,439
attention and if you're there but you're

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,159
not really

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,519
you know focused and involved is it is

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,519
it really still even a meeting

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,519
number two this is a scrum board it's a

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,120
it's a bunch of post-it notes keeping

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
track of what works being done and who's

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
doing it and these were already on the

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,479
ropes before

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,079
coronavirus because of distributed teams

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,160
but now it's just impossible there's no

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,560
way i'm devoting a wall to my house

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,479
in my house to do this and it wouldn't

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
help anyone because my team are

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
everywhere else so we end up with tools

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
like jira for

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
tracking this stuff and here's some guys

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
doing some pair programming two people

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
at one computer

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,880
and you can see their scrum board in the

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
background there this doesn't really

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
happen anymore either

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
we have to screen share to get things

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
like this and even then it's it's not

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
quite the same

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,800
and the tools we generally use for

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
screen share are things like teams and

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
skype and

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,520
and things that allow us to do chat too

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
and so there's this idea of having teams

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,440
big enough to feed with two pizzas

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
now this is attributed to jeff bezos on

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,960
this slide but i think this idea kind of

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
comes from ken beck who came up with the

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
agile approach called xp

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
or extreme programming he was he was

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
very keen on his developers all eating

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
together and working in close proximity

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,919
to each other so they could

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
discuss their issues over a coffee or a

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,639
doughnut

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
i don't know about you but most of the

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,639
people i work close closely with now

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,759
i've i've never even met physically

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,639
there a lot of them are in india

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,520
and finally uh this is planning poker

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,880
from scrum

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,280
the idea is that when you're planning

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,039
what work to do everyone's playing cards

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
and you you play a card down and the

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,720
higher the number of cards

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
you play the more complicated you think

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
the piece of work is

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
and the idea that is that everyone in

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
the team will eventually agree on the

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
complexity the size of a piece of work

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
the reason you're doing this with cards

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
is to stop peer pressure and group thing

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,759
you don't want the first person's

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
estimate

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
to affect the last person's so you play

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
all your cards at the same time

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
face down and then discuss why you all

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
came up with something different

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,919
again cards table face-to-face

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,600
discussions

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,360
it's it's all gone and so this is that

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
statement from the agile manifesto again

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,039
individuals and interactions over

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,840
processes and tools

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,759
it's it's apparent now and certainly for

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
a while that you can't do

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
individuals and interactions without

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
chat and phones and video conference

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,160
tools we need those

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,199
tools it's not a choice of this over

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
that as the

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,759
agile manifesto had it it's literally

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
you can't do that thing on the left

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,919
without the thing on the right it should

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
be

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,199
individuals and interactions via

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,639
processes and tools

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,600
but luckily there are teams that have

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,919
been working like that for a while now

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
on github like a lot of other people i

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,560
contribute to software projects and

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
rather than

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
coordinate with people using agile

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
approaches

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
that i've discussed we coordinate with

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
chat and here's an example where someone

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,599
on the internet has contributed a minor

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,680
fix for an article i wrote on github

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,199
and they opened an issue submitted a

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
pull request

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,440
and then i reviewed and merged it and

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,120
github works really well

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,639
like this so kobe is really forcing us

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
to move away from those traditional

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
agile practices

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
a while ago whether or not you preferred

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,599
one approach over the other was personal

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,479
style but now that's kind of irrelevant

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,880
you have to make that change

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,680
let's talk a bit about chat helps now so

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
when i've

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
done previous presentations i've thrown

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
up the definition of chat ops and it's

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,960
got a lot of people scratching their

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,919
heads and maybe not really understanding

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,400
the full impact of

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,199
it so today i'm going to come up at it

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,560
from a different

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,680
direction so let's ask the question

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,880
what is an operating system and

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
according to bbc bite size which is part

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,400
of the bbc for helping school children

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
advice for their exams

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,879
an operating system or os controls the

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
general operation of a computer

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
and provides an easy way for us to

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,440
interact with computers

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,960
and run applications the reason i chose

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,720
this definition is because

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,360
it's one of the only ones that mentions

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
us and os provides us an easy way to

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
interact with our computers

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,400
and do the stuff we want our computers

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
to do printing

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,039
editing spreadsheets whatever on the

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
desktop the dominant operating system is

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
microsoft windows

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,479
it's mediating the interactions between

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,680
you some software applications

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,599
and the hardware whereas on mobile

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
the dominant operating systems are ios

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,759
and android microsoft did try to

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,919
have a windows version for mobile but

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
that didn't really work out

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,719
the types of things we do on our phones

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
and tablets are different to the things

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,680
we do on the desktop so perhaps that's

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,640
one reason why we ended up with a

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,919
different operating system there

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
the underlying hardware is also

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,039
different so the operating system is

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,720
doing different things

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,800
and the applications a lot of the time

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
are different too

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
now here's a couple of other things that

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
you could claim to be a bit like

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,519
that definition of an operating system

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,920
things like skype or whatsapp here

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,880
mediate the interactions with a lot of

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,959
people

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,959
rather than applications and something

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
like apache kafka on the right there

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,720
which is an enterprise service bus is

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,560
mediating the interactions between

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,519
lots of applications it's allowing them

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,519
all to talk to each other

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,680
so chat ops essentially is the chat

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,839
platform as some kind of operating

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,360
system lots of users

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,160
lots of applications all working

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,760
together so let's look at an example and

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
for this i'm going to show you an issue

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,240
from our github project's

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,519
symfony java toolkit

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,360
so in this issue gab raises and

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
raises an issue suggesting changes

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
changing to the name the namespace and

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
he's see seeing mao

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
on on this with with that symbol there

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
in his comments

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
and on the left next line you can see a

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
verified badge

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,160
uh which says that gabs commit was

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,200
verified and next to that you can see a

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
red x

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,519
which shows that the result of the

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
commit a builder's run and it's failed

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,200
and additionally you can see that

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
there's the finos cla bot has added the

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
tag

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,360
cla present and mao mentions the issue

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,519
somewhere else and i comment on it

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,079
and this is a workflow input involving

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,360
people and applications

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
although in this context we call them

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
bots that you know for historic reasons

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,360
and github have arguably achieved a type

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,959
of operating system here designed to

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,880
allow people and applications to

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,959
collaborate and build software

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,839
whereas windows was an operating system

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
about well windows and people and mouse

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,560
and

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,800
on-screen buttons github is an operating

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
system about chats and repos and bots

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,200
and users and releases

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,959
and software and this slide says it all

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
teams is the new operating system

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,120
essentially for a customer it's where

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
they will do

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,880
everything that they need to do and this

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,360
is microsoft saying this microsoft gets

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
this they want to recreate the glory of

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
windows so much

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
that they bought github and they own

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,200
that and they're also throwing

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,279
everything they have at teams

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
so where we are so far well one there's

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,839
a new kind of operating system

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,160
that hosts our applications two cofit

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,200
has forced us into a new way of working

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,720
and three old agile practices

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,320
don't work anymore so if that's the case

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
we need to build our applications to

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
suit this new working environment

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,240
i've been developing bots and apps on

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,880
symphony for a number of years both at

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,320
hsbc and deutsche bank

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,320
since being at deutsche bank we've put

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,480
together the symphony java toolkit

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,120
and recently we've denoted donated this

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
to finos to own a market going forward

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
it's an open source collection of

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,880
libraries available on github

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,399
that you can use to build symphony bots

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
but to frame this work i want to take

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,160
you through the evolution of our

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,760
thinking with respect to building bots

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
and through that arrive at the reason

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,120
why we built this toolkit

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,839
so to start with my view of bots was

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,600
like

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,440
oh it's the command line all over again

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,160
i can type commands to my bot

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,560
and have it respond text text out it's

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,519
just like dos or linux

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,040
and although that's limiting it's also

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,880
really liberating because i don't have

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,480
to worry about authenticating the user i

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
don't have to worry about testing in

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
different browsers

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,839
i'll worry about networks of firewalls

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
or accessibility or keeping up to date

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,920
with the latest

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
fad javascript libraries on the front

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
end

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
so so that seemed nice but at the same

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
time it's much more limited than

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,600
building a web app say

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
we've see we've also seen a lot of times

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
bots being used for things they

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
shouldn't be

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
it seems like every website has a bot

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,720
these days and they're

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,720
they're really victims of a hype cycle

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
but there are use cases that work better

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,000
on chat platform

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
the first is anything to do with

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
notifications that works so much better

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
than than on a web application because

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,440
generally people always have their chat

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
platform open

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
and it's probably a better way to

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,079
receive a notification via email

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,760
if the notification is something short

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,680
a chat platform doesn't replace like a

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,519
wiki or a content management system but

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
it's a great way to notify people of

00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,839
things

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
and it's great for persistence all your

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,959
messages are recorded for all time

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,240
and they're searchable and obviously a

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,160
chat platform's a better

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
is it's way better than a browser app

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
for sharing things between groups of

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,920
people

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
because all of those abstractions are

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,320
provided for you around identity

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
and rooms and groups and messages and so

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,040
on

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
so you've got some good reasons for

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,079
building bots

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
and next i started to see that a chat

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,120
platform was really a bit like a big

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
append only database like datomix if you

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,120
know that one

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
you can do indexing through hashtag

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
inventions

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,399
hashtagging and mentioning people and

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,920
you can control access to different

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,600
pieces of information via private

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,440
chatrooms since different rooms have

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,519
different members and privacy settings

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
and administrators

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,440
each message on symphony and this is

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,360
true on teams and slack too

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,680
have a json payload as well as some

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,279
markup formatting the message

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,600
and that means that the chat is perfect

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,839
for storing details of a workflow

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,560
as we saw in those github examples

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,360
earlier

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
so rather than rather than do a tour of

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,120
the functionality of

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
the symfony java toolkit i'm just going

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
to demonstrate something we built with

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,480
it

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,160
and show you how it works a lot of the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,240
stuff i'm building at deutsche bank is

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,000
behind our firewall so i can't show you

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,639
any of that but a week ago

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
um the db symphony practice participated

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,519
in

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,160
symphony's yearly london hackathon now

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
as you'd expect this was done remotely

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,519
we were all sitting at home chatting

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,079
about what we were going to build using

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,079
symphony obviously and we were visit

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,160
video conferencing and screen sharing

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,160
but actually this was a plus as i've

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,639
said earlier my team is based in india

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,880
so

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,399
if we had a physical hackathon in london

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
it would have been a very different

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,880
story

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,600
my team wouldn't wouldn't really have

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,440
been able to get involved at all

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,199
but this just underlines the point

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,880
further about the changing nature of

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,040
development work

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,399
so we had to choose something to build

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,519
for the symphony hackathon

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,720
and probably somewhat fortuitously it

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,399
ties together

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,079
all of the things i've been talking

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,440
about so far at least

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,680
i hope so we've talked about symphony as

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,360
being like an append only database

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,920
which handles access control and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,680
indexing we talked about chat as being

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,279
like a new kind of operating system

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
linking people and bots and allowing

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,240
them to work together

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,760
and we talked about the effects of covid

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,360
on agile and how the

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
a lot of the practices of agile don't

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,440
work anymore and the symphony hackathon

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
gave us a great chance to test out how

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
quickly we could build something with

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,399
our

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,399
symphony java toolkit

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,560
so what did we build remember we only

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
had an eight hour working day to build

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,759
something in

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
so we weren't really looking to change

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,720
the world but hopefully

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,320
it will give you an idea of how the

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
symphony java toolkit works

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,000
so we built a symfony bot that allows

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,600
you to play the scrum planning poker

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,199
game via a symphony chat so

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,880
remember back to how i described this

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
earlier people get together they play

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
cards face down

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,920
and they try to indicate the complexity

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
estimates of tasks and then everyone

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
reveals their estimates and shows you

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,360
the results

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,040
and now i'd like i'd like to do you a

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
live demo of that

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,480
but unfortunately at the time of

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,120
recording all my colleagues are very

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
asleep

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
and so instead i'm going to replay the

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,519
demo we gave to the hackathon as a set

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,079
of slides

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,920
and yeah i mean this also reduces the

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,920
chance of a massive technical

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,759
disaster too so this is a bit of a

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,360
cop-out but hopefully

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
you'll be able to see how it works and

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,600
get an idea of what's going on anyway

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,920
and i'll be using screenshots of symfony

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
to illustrate my points

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,680
and at the same time i'll talk about the

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
symphony java toolkit and how it allows

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,639
us to build these things at

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,240
hackerspeak hackathon speeds sorry um

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,600
just as a trigger warning going in

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,000
there's going to be some screenshots of

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
java

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
code i'll be talking about them at a

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
high level

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,639
so there'll be no need to comprehend

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,639
what that code is doing

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,440
so instead of getting our developers

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
together in a meeting room

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
we're going to get our developers

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,000
together in a symphony room to play

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,559
playing poker and on this first screen

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
i've typed slash help often when you

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,439
want to address a command to a bot you

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,640
put a slash in front of the word so

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
people know it's robot

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
this is kind of a convention we have in

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,240
symphony and everyone in the room gets

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
to see these same messages so they see

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
this held message

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,079
and simply allows you to embed form

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
elements into a chat so

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,440
you can have these buttons like these

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,760
blue ones here and people can press them

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,240
to tell the bot to do things

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,039
and we're going to use those later so

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
first up

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,280
in planning poker someone proposes a

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,039
story to vote on

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,880
and at the bottom i'm typing in the

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,039
details of the story

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,000
now to identify the story we're using a

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,200
hashtag

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,200
so there it's moon tower so people can

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
refer to that story by using that hash

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,960
moon tower

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,799
and as i said before hashtags are kind

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
of like an index and in symphony i can

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,919
also watch tags

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
and get notifications each time they're

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,919
used just like in twitter

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
so the rest of that line is a

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
description of the story for the

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
other developers to think about and then

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
i

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,520
hit enter and this happens

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,760
so the bots replied back with a like a

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
card here containing the story

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,080
it's got a name a description and an

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,679
empty story points field

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,280
now remember back to our database

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
metaphor this is something like adding a

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,240
new row to the story table in the

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
database

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,520
and as i said before although there's

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,240
markup on the screen here to display the

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
story

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,679
there's also a json representation of

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,720
this story

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,400
that symphony and our bot both

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,720
understand so on the left

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
is the underlying json and that workflow

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,480
001 bit at the top there

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,559
that's the main bit the rest you can

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
kind of ignore it's got the name and the

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
description and then the

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
empty story points field in it on the

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,440
right

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,960
this is the java representation of that

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,760
story and you can see it's got fields

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
for the name

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,640
there's a hashtag and the description

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,960
and the story points

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
and the symphony java toolkit handles

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,240
all the serialization

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,039
and deserialization for you through the

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,679
magic of

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,039
jackson data binding so we didn't have

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,640
to think about any of that while we did

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,600
the hackathon we just wrote the thing on

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
the right

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
and then the thing on left the left we

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,080
got for free and the symphony java

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
toolkit

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,840
also handled the presentation of that

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,160
story on simply for us

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
kind of a basic way although as we're

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
going to see it's

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,320
it's custom customizable with some

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,799
templates

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
so um so we haven't set the story points

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,799
yet

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,080
um next if i click on that poker button

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,960
uh which in this

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
screenshot is turned into a tick after i

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,559
pressed it then

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,320
our symphony bot replies back pogba

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,480
created for moon tower

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,520
and then there's a button there to end

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
the poll

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
and as you can see on the top left of

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,679
the screen in that little red circle

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,320
i've been notified of a private message

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,320
from the bots

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,280
and this is the private message here

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,480
asking me how many points i want to give

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,919
to this story

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
so this is the equivalent of the playing

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,720
cards uh from that real

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,200
poker planning game and yeah i know this

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,919
looks a bit scrappy in a bit

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,520
not the presentation's not great um but

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
you know this was a hackathon we were

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,039
just working quickly

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,880
uh so yeah scrum uses these weird

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,280
fibonacci series numbers which i can't

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
quite

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,679
get behind but you know whatever this is

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,720
just a hackathon we're not trying to

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,919
reinvent the world here so everyone in

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,360
the original room

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
everyone who is a member of that

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,200
original chat gets a message

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,440
like this and then they all reply back

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,360
with their votes

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,440
and so here you go you can see all the

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,200
votes coming back into the main room

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,440
and we did this live in the hackathon

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,280
and we got all the judges to be in the

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,200
room and vote on the story too so you

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
can see them all voting here

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,559
and you can you can't tell how many

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,440
points they gave but you you know they

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,679
voted

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
and so this was quite a nice interactive

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,400
experience for everyone and made a

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,440
really good

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
good demo for our hackathon entry

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
um behind the scenes what's happening in

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
the room we're basically writing these

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,000
votes as messages into the room

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,600
so again it's like an append only

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,039
database we're appending each answer

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
into the room

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
here we see the javabean code for the

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
answer on the left

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,240
and that json representation for it

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,760
again the workflow

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,159
one thing is is the main answer

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,280
we've got uh the user the poll id the

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,679
choice they made

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
when they made it and so on now what we

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,360
didn't show you

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,799
now so so that we didn't show you how

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,480
many points the user gave

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,400
we customized the message view with the

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,919
free marker template

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,840
and you can see that there at the bottom

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,840
it's referenced in the answer java class

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,760
using that annotation

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
on line 12 on the left there

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,760
and the symfony java toolkit just takes

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
care of all of this super super easy to

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,440
set up

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,039
and it basically generates and dumps out

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
these free marker templates if you don't

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,240
provide them

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,520
so what you can do is you can have a

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,520
template free

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,280
running of the code look at the

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,400
templates it generates and then go and

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
customize them

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,799
and then reference them in your project

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,880
so you don't really even need to code

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,240
know how to code apache free marker all

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,679
that well you can just

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,440
sort of play around with what's there

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
and work from that

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,520
which is it's nice and makes things

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
really simple

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,799
uh at some points then so everyone's

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,799
voted uh

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,159
which we left as that button to click in

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,000
the m in the hackathon but you can

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
you can close it by clicking that end

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
poll button and so the bot then

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,760
looks back at all the answers in the

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,520
chat room and tallies them up it's just

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
like doing a database query

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,559
and again using the free market template

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,120
and the json

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,760
we produce this table of results and at

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
this time

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,120
at this point because all the results

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,559
are different in scrum

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,640
what you'd normally do now is you'd have

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,600
a discussion about why they're different

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,039
and vote again and obviously all of that

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,919
can just happen in the chat room with

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,600
messages

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,039
or you could fire up a conference call

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,679
in symphony and and

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,120
hash it out between you but the idea is

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,919
really is that this sort of stuff can

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,559
happen

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
asynchronously and not in a meeting

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,080
anymore

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,600
once once you get some kind of agreement

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,919
you can hit the assign button

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,280
and set the results and we by the time

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
we got to this point we were really

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,760
running out of time so we kind of fudged

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,360
it

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,600
i think there should be like a button

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,760
here to assign the

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
the most popular number of answers which

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,799
is eight as well but we didn't

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,679
we didn't get to that um so

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,279
if i hit that button to assign um what

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,720
happens now is we write a new message

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,440
into the room with the details of the

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
story

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,440
updated and it's got now the number of

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,960
story points attached to it

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
and i'm going to show you just one tiny

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
bit of code to demonstrate how that

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,279
function works

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,240
so what you can see it here this is our

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,400
result class in

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,000
java it's got all the details of the

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,520
fields that you need to display that bar

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,039
chart who's voted for what like the

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,159
counts and the names and the options in

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,960
the question

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,880
and the story hashtag in there and it's

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,679
got that template on there so we can

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,520
format the bar

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,039
chart when you hit that highest button

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,919
on on the results it actually is going

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,400
to run this method called highest here

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,360
uh and it gets past some parameters so

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
the symfony

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,559
java toolkit will hand you pretty much

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
whatever parameters you ask for here

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,520
it's very

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,200
it's very open and extensible so here

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
we're passing it the details of the room

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,400
where it all happened

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:43,039
and also the this history api too

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,679
and on line 37 we find the relevant

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,640
story

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,679
that this was the result for and on line

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,279
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,760
we fight we figure out which was the

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,000
highest option that got voted on

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,440
and on line 39 we changed that number of

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,760
story points

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
and on line 40 we're returning that new

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,520
version of the story which symphony

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,520
will then put back in the chat room so

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,200
as far as our bots concerned

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,440
we don't really know need to know much

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
about messages and chat rooms and stuff

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,279
we can let the tool kit handle that

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,960
toolkit worry about all of that and the

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,480
json formats and all that stuff

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,480
it's all just taken care of

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,520
so the hackathon bot was just really for

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,159
a bit of fun for us

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,279
and we wanted to try out use our toolkit

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,640
and anger and see if we could build

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,760
things quickly with it

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
we're going to show some people

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,279
internally this bot and see if they want

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,320
us to carry on developing it but

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,159
personally

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,679
i'm not completely sure that scrum's

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,880
planning poker is going to survive the

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,000
transition to the

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,240
post-agile world but hopefully

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,679
um i've used this to demonstrate some of

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
the power of the symphony java toolkit

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,679
today

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,600
there's actually a lot more going on

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,520
here that i haven't covered

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
so it does symphony apps it handles

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,640
clustering it handles micro service

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
configuration

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
12 factor apps that kind of thing it

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,039
does fix messages it can do reporting on

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,960
maven builds it's got health endpoints

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,120
and spring actuator metrics

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
and it handles an authentication token

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,200
life cycles and all this sort of stuff

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,559
and we've got tutorials for all these

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
things as well

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,679
we're really proud to have been able to

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,200
contribute this to finnos

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,440
because we think this is something lots

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,360
of developers can benefit from

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,640
and we're talking to symfony themselves

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,159
about this too and they've

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,559
they they've agreed that they're going

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,600
to donate their bot tool kit

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,440
development to finos 2 and uh sometime

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,120
in 2021 we're going to combine our

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,400
efforts together

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,400
and build something really great

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,559
as a whole piece so yeah watch this

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,559
space there's a lot going on in the

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,240
world of symfony bots

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,000
and we actually have a lot more pieces

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
of this in the pipeline

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,120
which maybe i'll come back and talk

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,279
about another time so

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,720
thank you very much for listening if

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,400
you've got any questions

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
put them in the chat and i'm going to

00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:02,880
hand over and discuss those

00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,880
