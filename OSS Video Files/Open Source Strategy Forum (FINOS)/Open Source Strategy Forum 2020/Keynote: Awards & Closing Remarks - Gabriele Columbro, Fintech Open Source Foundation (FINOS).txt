many concrete examples of you know how

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
open source can improve this industry

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,640
and beyond that

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
making a lasting impact in areas like

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,240

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
i truly hope this conference very much

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,320
like last year can help you find

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,600
ways to spark into action by

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,399
participating

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,720
providing us feedback and continuing

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,720
helping you know amplify

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,079
the message that these industries long

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,439
overdue a better model of collaboration

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
and this is not just because the

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,040
industry will benefit it

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,600
benefit from it sorry um but you know as

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
either

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,719

you know we hope uh you know they can

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,480
get an advantage down the line as i say

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,360
as i like to say open sourcing financial

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,879
services is a positive sum game

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,879
because the reality is that there's an

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,800
immediate opportunity here

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,560
whether you represent a bank looking for

open source commercialization or a

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,200
regulator looking for more transparency

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,720
in the implementation and enforcement

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,280
process

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,440
and finally last but not least if you

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,160

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
playing field for

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
any contributors regardless of race

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,680
gender provenance

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,879
as you've heard yesterday from ali we

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,159
still have a lot

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,519
of work to do in diversity but it's

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,640
important to get started

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,720
now in this time of social reckoning

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,599
and more selfishly because it makes us

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,159
stronger as a community

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,879
on this note let me get to my favorite

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,120
part

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,120
of the conference awarding our community

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
for their incredible participation last

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
year and

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,439
since unfortunately i won't be able to

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,599
shake your hands in person this year

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,360
we decided to go for a more you know

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,959
academy award type feel

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,599
like last year we are awarding

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,040
contributors in three categories

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,680
the newcomer award the contributor that

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,920
joined

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,599
our community this year that made most

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
contributions

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,560
our top contributor award and our

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,800
helping us grow our community

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,000

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,599
well done attila thank you so much for

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,599
your contributions

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,919
so first of all i would like to thank

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,039
finos for creating this award i think

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,919
it's a great way to

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,800
encourage people to contribute and so i

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,400
would like to

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,599
encourage everyone to contribute to

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,919
morpher but i have to warn you

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
there are some potential side effects

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
you might become

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,680
very passionate and start decorating

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,240
your walls

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,800
using the morpher logo or maybe buy

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,840
bicycles that go with it or maybe some

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,039
clothing so

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,440
so be careful um on a more serious note

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,000
though

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,039

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,520
co-creator of morpher

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,560
