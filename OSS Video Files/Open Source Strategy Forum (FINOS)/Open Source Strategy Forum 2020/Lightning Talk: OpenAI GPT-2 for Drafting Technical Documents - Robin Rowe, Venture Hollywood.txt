hi

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,599
i'm robin rowe and this is gabriel

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,119
gabriel pantera and we're here today uh

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
to talk about uh using openai gpt2 for

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
drafting

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,320
technical documents give me a second

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
here where i switch over my screen

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,840
and here we go

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
okay well first of all thank you for the

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
linux foundation for having us here

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,160
today

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
we're going to be talking about complete

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,800
a thought

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,760
ai this is where we give artificial

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
intelligence

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,920
a sample of the kind of text output that

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,840
we would like

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,960
and it tries to complete what we're

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,280
doing

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,000
so a little background on us here's some

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,000
past technology projects

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,200
i've worked in ar and vr

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,799
cameras traffic control

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,000
defense uh i live in uh we both live

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,920
in hollywood and so we also do

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
technology behind the movies

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
and uh cartoon series so animation

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
software

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,560
uh and then also a set-top box

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,920
so i'm the chairman of uh ansi iso

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,560
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
this is a future world standard for

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840
innovation idea

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
management best practices here are the

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,640
countries that

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
are involved it's most of the world

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,640
and i'm going to back up for just a

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
second why am i going to back up

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
gabrielle

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,159
because he wants to talk about ai speech

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,920
recognition starting in 1996.

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,479
okay so the reason i'm going back in

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
history here is that a lot of people

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,119
find uh ai very confusing it's hard to

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,600
understand how it works and in fact

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,920
nobody

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
really understands how ai works because

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,160
it has so much hidden complexity

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
but i founded the research lab at a

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,720
defense company

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,200
long ago and we used hidden markov

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,280
models which was an early

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560
version of what we have today and it's a

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
little bit easier to understand

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
so i'm going to quickly go through this

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
uh or actually gabrielle will

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,760
okay uh well first it deduces hidden

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
states

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,959
and uses path probabilities so the

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
hidden states in this case are rainy and

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
sunny

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,440
we know whether our people are walking

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,879
shopping or cleaning

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,480
but we don't know what the weather is

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,680
and we're trying to deduce that

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,879
using hmms and then they use

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,480
um predict the next syllable

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,360
syllable so they can predict

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
each syllable and then each word of uh

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,080
what is being said

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,760
so then it outputs sr text yeah that's

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
the speech recognition text

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,200
and it's precursor to the current ai

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,159
that we have now

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:13,280
yeah and that is gpt-2

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,000
complete a thought ai okay so we now

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
kind of understand how ai works here's

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,120
the process

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,760
so um all the experts are volunteers

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
so it's really hard to find a time to

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
get people together and do all this

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
stuff

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
our document has to be about 50 pages in

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
length

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
and so there's a process we break it

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
into sections

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,640
and assign to writers different areas

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
for them to take over

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
uh blank page means writer's block which

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
means you don't know what to write

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,080
so you try to get help from other people

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,120
you can solo draft sections

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
uh and they become l-o-r let's load the

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,000
rings

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,239
my precious yes we have you know it's

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
it's very difficult to draft for a blank

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
page with a group

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,080
so typically what happens is one person

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
ends up doing the first draft

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,840
and then we get into this thing of they

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,680
don't want to change change

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,879
it's not precious they don't want to

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,879
change you never get like that dude

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
i think everyone does all right so

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
personally on so and then we have

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,440
problems of cohesion style repetition

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,199
bias skew

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,479
all kinds of stuff because we've got

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
dozens of people writing

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,759
different sections of this document and

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,400
it becomes

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,120
sort of a stew so later through many

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
drafts

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,320
years and years later we have a standard

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
yay

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
yeah five years later

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,360
here's how we do it with gpt2 we draw a

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,600
mind map

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,440
first which is free mind yeah we

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
freebind is an open source program for

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
doing mind maps but there are

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
a dozen different programs to do mind

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
maps and i'll show you a mind map

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
in uh just a minute we create table of

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
content from map or labor office

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
well we do that in libreoffice in

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,800
libreoffice but

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,199
the table of contents has sections and

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520
each section has topics

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
write one intro paragraph per topic as

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,479
text files

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
and then we have to go get gpt2 but

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,520
don't get just any gpg2

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
get my fork of gpt2 because i'm

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
maintaining it

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
the the version that is the one that

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
open ai

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,520
posted they've gone into gpt 3 and

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
they've

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,639
seemed to have forgotten about it so

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,680
they're not updating

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,919
yeah and uh put our text intro files one

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
per topic in a folder

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,960
and then you edit example bash script to

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
point our

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
to our data which i'll show you in just

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
a minute and then you run bash script

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
for gpt

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,320
2 to complete each topic yeah then uh go

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
for coffee or go for lunch depending on

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
how long your document is

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
it's pretty fast but it just sits there

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,400
and chews it doesn't really do anything

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,000
exciting to show you on screen

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,919
so here's uh the concept of a mind map

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
i'm just going to go over this in about

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,440
a second here

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,560
and the the stay in the center that

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
we're looking at

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,400
uh that is what i call a big hero 6

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
diagram if you're familiar with the

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,560
movie

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,960
uh this is a has a head and two arms

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
and two feet and this is just a way of

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,319
thinking of a table of contents as being

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
five uh basic things and behind it is

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
the actual mind map and i'll show you

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,319
that

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,600
in just a moment so here's hello world

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,000
this is uh what we gave uh gpt2

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,880
just to make sure that we had it working

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,039
so

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,720
um i took mary had a little lamb it's

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,440
fleece as white as snow

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
and you get the output of she hated snow

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,720
she hated snow

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,720
she hated how does gbt do know that

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
charles was reportedly so terrified

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,160
during the incident that he ran to his

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,280
girlfriend and began weeping yeah we're

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
not going to read the whole thing to you

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
but you get the idea here it's written

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
something

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
very bizarre but it's written something

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
it's written something and it's written

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
in a number of lines

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
that's how and we've specified in the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,440
settings how long it'll it'll write

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,759
until you tell it to stop

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,840
so we've said how much we wanted and

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,880
here it is

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,319
okay so we're gonna exit that

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,919
and we're going to call up our

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,599
script how are we doing on time gabriel

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,639
uh we're at a little over seven minutes

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,120
okay so we're halfway here so here's our

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,199
bash script i wrote this script

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
it has a number of variables at the top

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,039
uh which are things that we set the

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
main thing that we care about here is

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,240
the model name

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,479
these are the standard models that come

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,039
with gpt2 they're humongous

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,919
and we can also create our own models so

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,160
we've got the 124 meg model here

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,840
and these are the corpus of documents

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,840
that have been ground up

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,919
and made into sausage that gpt-2

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
goes through and uses to decide what to

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,039
write

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
uh the number of samples uh i'm gonna

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,560
have

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,759
gpd2 take 12 tries at

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
writing something uh each try has some

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
random to it so

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
i get 12 different tries instead of

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,479
doing one long try

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,080
and you'll see why in just a second uh

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,560
this top k don't worry about that the

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
length

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,800
is how long uh you know i'm going to do

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,120
300 characters here

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
the temperature is how random the thing

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,919
is the

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
the higher the temperature the less

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
random it is uh

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,919
here's my python script i'm going to

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,360
call this thing is mostly in python

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,720
uh and then um

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
this is the extension that i want to

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
write on the name of my file then we

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,039
come down here and this is just

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,800
a bash for loop that is going through

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,240
and chewing on each of those files that

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
we put in our input folder

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
and writing a new file to the output

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,120
folder that includes

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,479
uh that concatenates what we wrote with

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
whatever gp2

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
wants to write okay so what does that

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,800
look like

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,800
now we're getting to the good stuff so

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,399
here's a human input

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,360
this was written by one of our experts

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
probably me in this case but maybe not

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
and

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
uh it says this is the people section

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,200
and we're going to talk about culture

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
so organizational culture is a set of

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
shared attitudes blah blah blah blah

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,120
blah

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,040
and then we come down here so here's

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,279
what gpt2 thinks

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
we want to write next so sample number

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,360
one example number one is culture

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
this this word has two meanings it

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,440
refers to the culture of people

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
and the organization eg culture of the

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
company

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,399
and is a set of cultural experiences

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
that help guide actions and decisions by

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,880
employees

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,800
keep going yeah okay uh the word can

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
also refer to the culture of persons in

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,360
an

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
organization cultures are a set of

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
shared values

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
attitudes and beliefs that enable

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
individuals to participate

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
in and contribute to the organization

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,800
okay so we'll stop there

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,959
you'll notice that at the end of

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,320
sample one it says cultures have

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,040
different

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
okay different one well i told it to cut

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
off

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,800
at this many characters so it cut off

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,040
right in the middle of a sentence

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
now in the samples below i've gone ahead

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,360
and finished the sentence because i can

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,959
i can anticipate where it's going but i

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,560
just wanted to show you that this is a

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
feature that it doesn't know

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
to cut off at the end of a sentence

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,519
although we could program to do that

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,279
it's just cutting off at whatever word

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
it is and that's fine

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
so here's sample two read a sentence of

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,160
that uh cultural competence is the

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
ability to recognize

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
understand and influence others okay and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
then three

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,959
three is it is important to understand

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
the roles that culture plays in a

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,760
business

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,680
its objectives and its business purposes

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
culture is an important aspect of

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,519
organizational

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
the organization is what it is what it

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,360
is this is the one i love how does gb22

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
know this the organization

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
is what it is i mean this is like really

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,279
binding though

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,760
we're getting like kind of new aging it

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,720
is

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
well i was going to read the next

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,320
sentence it is what it is to be defined

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
by its culture

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
by what it is to be defined by its

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,920
members

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
it is getting a little bit annuity there

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,079
yeah yeah

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,680
okay raise them six is the culture of an

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,680
organization also informs the way

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
members respond to their circumstances

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,320
in the world

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,839
this looks like it went back yeah it

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
often does this because remember we're

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
doing random

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,640
right so it doesn't remember that it's

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,320
already done something here and it could

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
hit something that is essentially the

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,800
same

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,800
right uh one important aspect of

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,079
cultural organization is the belief in

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,079
shared values and norms

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
sorry we're checking yep oh no we're

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,279
coming up on our time here yep

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,120
uh there's eight uh cultural change is

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,959
made by changing values and attitudes to

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
conform to values and attitudes that are

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,120
more appropriate

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,040
in a new environment

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,959
uh the key to understanding

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
organizational culture is that it has a

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,600
deep and per se

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,720
invasive and people

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
who participate in it

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,440
uh the cultural component of an

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,000
organizational culture is very important

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360
yeah that's kind of kind that one just

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,839
kind of repeats itself

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
okay so here here you see that you know

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,680
sometimes it's better than others

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
uh let's see 11 and that's why we're

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,320
doing 12 samples

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
because some of these are going to be

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
lame and we may just delete them

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
right for example the value of a team

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,760
culture is the workplace

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
in the workplace may be defined as the

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,480
organization's

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,800
attitude towards teams and the

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
individuals who are associated with them

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,160
that sounds like double talk but okay

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,279
yeah it does a lot of double talk

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,440
because it doesn't actually know what

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,120
it's saying it's using probability like

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
we talked about on the slide

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
to predict what the next word should be

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,920
but it doesn't actually understand

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,240
anything that's saying and number 12 is

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,720
the culture can be understood

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
not as a behavior of individuals but as

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
a collection of experiences

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,720
of value that's a collective like i'm

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,240
sorry as a collective

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,760
collection i was looking ahead i'm sorry

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,000
but as a collective

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,040
experience of values beliefs methods and

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,480
tools yeah so

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,120
so basically uh in management

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
uh people culture is a board collected

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,880
so

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,440
that's very logical from gbt2 standpoint

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,000
yeah says the board collective at 12.

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,839
and

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,720
so that's it we're out of we're out of

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,760
time uh we hope that you've enjoyed gpt2

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,120
uh go to uh

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
github to robin row uh gpg2

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
if you want to download and play with

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
this uh it

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
should run on just about any operating

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,440
system it is extremely tweaky

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,800
to get gtp2 to run uh

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
just make sure that you follow the

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
instructions there because i've walked

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,800
through

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,399
everything we need to do to make it

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:43,519
actually work

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:43,519
