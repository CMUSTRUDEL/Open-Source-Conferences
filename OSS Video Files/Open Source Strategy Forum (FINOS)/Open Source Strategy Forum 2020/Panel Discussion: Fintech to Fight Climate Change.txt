	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,759
all right good afternoon i am michael

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
tiemann i am the project lead from

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,639
os climate and i'm also going to

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,679
introduce our panelists today

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,480
i'm going to start with a little

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,119
introduction in the world of high tech

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,119
the question of the day is often what is

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,119
the next big thing

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,039
and then open source came along and the

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,600
question became what's the next big

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
thing

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,080
in open source i don't need to tell you

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,840
that climate change is a big thing and

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
it's a big thing for people

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,360
for corporations and for people who

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,399
invest

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,440
in corporations it's the kind of problem

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
made for a globally scalable innovation

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
solution

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
such as open source and this is what our

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
panelists

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,280
are going to talk about today on our

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
panel we have

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,480
truman siemens the ceo of the os

00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,320
climate project we have lisa eichler

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,280
who is the co-head of climate and esg

strategy for amazon

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,360
and myself michael timon

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,479
i am a project lead for os climate and

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,119
uh i also work as a vp of open source

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,240
affairs

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,240
at red hat and so let's

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,880
let's start off with truman telling us

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,000
some of the key trends in how the world

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
addresses

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,799
uh climate and how that's driving

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
fintech solutions great thank you

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
michael and

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,280
and um we appreciate the chance to be at

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
this conference and

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
thank you for participating in the panel

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,159
um so i'm looking at my window

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
uh at uh hurricane the the remains of

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,360
hurricane

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,280
edda uh michael and i are both in a

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,479
state that is experiencing

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,040
uh record rainfalls uh and and i i

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,079
depending on where where you all reside

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,399
very likely

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,200
uh you've been impacted by one of the

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,640
major

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,759
events fires floods uh hurricanes

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,239
um that is is

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,200
that is really shaping um and reshaping

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
the planet

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
um you may also live in a place where

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
the economic transition

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,959
to a low-carbon economy is having an

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,840
impact uh whether that's by

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,120
uh changing price prices and demand for

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
fuels etc

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
um so a couple of the things that are

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
are really happening that

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,160
that bring this down to uh what's

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
happening um

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
in open source and around fit tech um

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,040
are

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,480
that um you know essentially what these

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
transitions are happening

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,120
but climate risk whether it's transition

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
risk transition to a new economy or

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
physical risk are not priced into

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
markets

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
uh that's one of the reasons why climate

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
change

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
is at the top of the agenda for the

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
incoming biden administration

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
um uh os climate took part in the

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,480
development of

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,480
the first ever um comprehensive guidance

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,280
for all u.s financial regulators

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
released in september calling for a

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
mandatory

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
price on carbon and that's part of the

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
biden platform

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,800
likewise in europe the the main

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
financial regulator is going to be

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
promulgating

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,480
uh new regulations coming out in march

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,760
that call for the same thing

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,680
so what that means is that um and that's

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
uh there's also requirements coming down

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
from all the central banks

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
requiring stress testing requiring that

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,239
financial institutions across the

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,560
uh the globe and 50 uh 50 countries

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,760
and this and it was really uh ultimately

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
spread to all countries

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
that financial institutions understand

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
and report on

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
um the climate-related systemic risk in

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
their portfolios

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
so what does that mean it means that

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
essentially

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,360
almost every large corporation and large

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
financial services player

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
that is participating in this conference

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,840
has got to act

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
um that's the demand side and we'll talk

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,120
more about

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,439
the supply side the solution uh later on

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
in the talk

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,200
all right thank you thank you for

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,879
setting the stage uh

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,920
let's uh let's understand what is um

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,919
uh what is the os climate platform and

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,959
what's the vision

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,959
so um

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,720
today um where we stand and sit um

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,080
there uh is a gap of literally 1.2

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,600
at least 1.2 trillion dollars a year

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,440
um in an unmet finance and investment

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
that would be required

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
to meet the goals of the paris climate

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,759
accords um

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,280
and um and therefore to avoid really

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
catastrophic disruption

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,199
of of the economy society and the

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,560
environment

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,840
there are um large

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,000
investors institutional investors

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,080
with 40 trillion under assets who have

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
said we're going to respond

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,759
but they haven't yet because except

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
really around the margins because they

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,280
lack

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,280
the necessary data and tools

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
and analytic tools to integrate

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,039
climate-related risk and opportunity

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
into a whole range of investment

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,080
decisions the same is true in

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,680
corporations

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,080
and so uh os climate uh has a vision of

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,600
uh developing the a data commons

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,120
and the required data quality

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
trusted comparable data about

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
corporations about markets about the

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,000
physical world

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
combined with a platform of open

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
analytic tools

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,960
that is able to run a whole range of of

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,000
scenario-based analysis

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,840
drawing from science but applying these

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,960
to concrete decisions in the capital

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,479
markets

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
so lisa eisler based on your experience

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,960
with

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
institutional investors and financial

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,039
institutions

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,520
what do they need in an open source

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,400
platform like this

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
yes um thank you michael so maybe just

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
to give the audience a bit of a view of

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
um

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
yeah what our experience there has been

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,759
so ortec finance we're really kind of a

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,120
fintech

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,560
uh specialized in in modeling um and and

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
building technology

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
for the financial sector so for these

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,800
institutional investors including

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
insurance

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
against large insurance companies

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,360
pension funds sovereign wealth funds and

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
so on

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
and traditionally they have been using

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
this to these

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,800
these financial decision making tools

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,120
without the climate angle

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
in it but about three four years ago

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
there was really this this

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,960
up kick and trend in in uh yeah

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,479
investors wanting to find out how can

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
they integrate climate risk

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
um and broader also climate alignment

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,120
thinking

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,080
into these uh into these tools and um

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,880
yeah that's what

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,599
we have uh focused on um and we really

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,639
see

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,039
that uh um investors really struggle

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
with

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,280
this same common question on figuring

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,160
out the available standards

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,800
but also the available data and tooling

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
around

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,080
around the topic of of climate change

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
and we also see that at the same time

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
our collaborators

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
in this field in terms of you know

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,039
service providers data providers

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
scientists but also

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,639
uh competitors uh the same all we're all

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
racing

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
as fast as possible to work on filling

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,800
these current

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,199
gaps but what we feel very strongly

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
about

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,520
um as our tech finance is is that

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,360
you know to get these basics in place it

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,680
could very much be accelerated

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
if if everyone worked together towards

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,199
that that one

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,120
a common goal so joining forces in terms

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,400
of the hours invested

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,840
the the the innovation budgets spent we

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,199
because in the end we're trying to like

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,400
you already said in the introduction

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
we're trying to tackle

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,599
one common challenge that the world is

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,520
facing and we only have about 10 years

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,879
left to act um to to give

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,280
uh you know the future world a chance um

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
and succeed in in the transition to a

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,440
low carbon economy so

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
um for that to to build this common base

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
layer and

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
really have um a unified platform that

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
can

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,440
provide open data open tools

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
uh so that all the analytics around

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,919
climate change can become more

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,520
comparable

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,759
consistent and transparent i think

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,319
that's really a common trend that we

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,319
see in from the investors perspective

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
truman did i see you wanted to add

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,039
something to that

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,240
um i could but uh but perhaps um this is

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,680
a good point uh for

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,279
lisa to talk about um the

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
the net zero actually i'll tell you what

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
i'll do this at least i'll kind of tee

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,399
you up here

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,279
so um the initial members uh of os

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,160
climate um under the linux foundation

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,560
are

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,959
allianz which combined with its

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
its investment management subsidiaries

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,080
uh manages

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,320
um several trillion dollars in assets um

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,800
not just the insurance company uh but

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,839
also a major major asset manager

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,760
uh amazon microsoft and s p global one

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,279
of the leading

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,399
market data and analytics providers

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,680
one of the reasons why uh allianz

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,200
is involved and um

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,880
and they are a long time client by the

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,720
way of vortech finance

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,959
is because of a thing called the net

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,760
zero asset owner alliance so i referred

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
uh to some of these major commitments um

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
that are

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,360
that are drawing um demand for better

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
data and analytics and lisa why don't

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,040
you say just a word about the net zero

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,440
asset in our alliance

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,800
yeah i think uh the nastier asset online

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
lines just uh like

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
actually various other initiatives that

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,160
are kind of investor

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,480
driven initiatives they're really

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,160
looking for um yeah like what i what i

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
said a kind of a unified

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
um approach right and and they would

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
like to accelerate uh the the building

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,920
of of

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,079
more openly available data sets as well

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,279
as as tools for analytics

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,120
um and and together so so not uh

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,720
choosing uh across a uh types of

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
commercial data sets necessarily but

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
really finding um

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
thing a solution that is comparable and

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
and very transparent and

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
they are really involved in driving um

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
yeah this

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,800
also the os climate initiative

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,360
and uh yeah supporting where they can

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,160
i'm just going to mention so um these

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,880
are these are not small institutions um

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,560
uh aviva axa uh calpers the largest uh

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,600
uh asset owners in the us de depot

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,440
in um in uh in france

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,560
uh cdbq um uh

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
let's see generali munich race swiss

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,279
free nordea

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,839
so so

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,839
zurich so some of the very largest

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,079
financial institutions on the planet

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,120
and not only have they committed to net

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
zero

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
emissions in their investment portfolios

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
by 2050 but they've

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,279
they've act they've each also made

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,800
commitments uh by 2025 for very

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
substantial reductions

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,160
but they don't know how to get there

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,480
they're taking a major risk and there's

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,399
a

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
there's a need for speed so that's one

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,920
of the reasons why

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,720
they're turning to open source uh to

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
meet those needs

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,399
yeah that's absolutely a great point

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
figuring out how to navigate the

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,920
financial movements to get there is

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
really a super big challenge and one of

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,600
the things that

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
the os climate platform is being

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
positioned to

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
answer and i've actually been leading

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,240
the alpha prototype

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,160
efforts uh among some of the initial os

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,440
climate members

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,560
but first lisa and adrian could you say

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,279
a few words

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,320
about the work that has been done and is

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
underway so far

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,720
lisa why don't you talk a little bit

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,320
about the sbti tool

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,000
yes so um as uh osc we we were

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,760
tasked um to build actually the the

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,279
science-based targets initiative is as

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,040
large an initiative once again

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,200
many investors many stakeholders

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,760
involved and um they have

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
developed a very credible methodology

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
for measuring

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,639
actually temperature um scoring and

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,920
portfolio

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,560
alignment to a transition to uh

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,200
any kind of carbon reduction targets

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,600
right

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,440
and they were looking for somebody to

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,720
build an open source tool that can

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,200
be the calculation engine so to say um

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
to yeah to put this methodology into

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
practice so that

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,079
investors as well as companies can start

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,440
measuring

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,519
their their temperature score and

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,560
portfolio coverage and

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,279
so over the last few months we have been

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,480
hard at work

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,519
building this open source python

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,079
code which is really aimed to be able to

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,560
integrate

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
it in any commercial or homegrown

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,040
decision support

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,800
uh tooling or also run as a standalone

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,680
version and it has been launched

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,079
early october as an open source tool

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
like

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,399
we've been mentioning and currently

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,279
we're now working on further building on

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,800
top of that

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,120
with the os climate community

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,480
and yeah further expanding its

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
functionality over time

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,279
adrian yeah sure um

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,040
so aws has been supporting open data for

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,160
a long time we've had that program for

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
many years

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,839
and in 2018 we announced

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,959
the amazon sustainability data

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,959
initiative

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
since then it's grown to about 20

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,880
petabytes of

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,639
of basically climate data the data you

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,639
need to build these kinds of tools so

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,760
that was our starting point

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,079
and what we've what we're doing now is

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,959
we're

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,480
taking um we're looking at the data

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,880
we've got we're looking at the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
additional data that's needed to support

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,279
these tools

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,240
and the the entire program we're adding

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,440
new things to

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,040
asdi new data sources and with asdi make

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,120
sure the data is clean

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
it's got somebody's going to keep it up

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,680
to date

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,639
and we host it for free on aws so that's

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,639
that's kind of the bottom-up approach

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,279
then we're also working top-down

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,800
with alliance particularly to define how

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,600
they want to use this what are the

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,279
different

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
sort of flows what are the different uh

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,399
user needs that we can

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,880
in use cases that we want to build

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,279
and then in the middle we've got we're

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,920
integrating things like sbti

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,680
and other contributed and analytics

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,120
packages that are doing things like

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,360
physical risk

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
and that can drive investment in

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,480
resilience to

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
heat close and river flooding drought

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
things like that

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,680
and we're pulling all this together with

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,639
a data catalog

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,440
interface and the the team that's doing

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,279
this we've contributed some aws credits

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,279
to os climate to run

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,079
this themselves but also we've

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,079
contributed a professional services team

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,920
which has a great deal of experience in

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,959
building data data lakes data

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,959
warehousing

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,639
and so that team is basically

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,360
kick-starting the

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,920
the open source contribution to get get

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
it get

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
the thing initially in place

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,040
thank you uh in addition uh aliens and

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,120
microsoft have been working on building

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,079
some stress testing tools

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,399
for climate risk management by insurance

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,160
companies and banks and we've been

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,000
looking at the work for example that the

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,560
bank of england has put out there

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
on the prudential 2019 insurance model

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,720
the bes

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,360
2021 model and all this

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,279
is is coming together in a context at

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,480
the linux foundation

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,120
which obviously supports many other

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
cross industry open source

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,079
collaborations

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,120
such as os lfai

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:17,199
lf energy automotive grade linux

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:21,120
and other um umbrella projects

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:24,880
related to open open climate and esg

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,279
data but i'd like to ask

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,079
adrian what uh what was it that really

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,320
brought you

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,160
and amazon into os climate

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
um well i've been personally interested

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
in sustainability for

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,320
many years and most recently i've been

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
working on open source

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,079
for aws so this is a kind of a natural

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,399
bridge for me

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,839
um but what really happened a little

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,279
over a year ago

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
jeff bezos uh made the climate pledge

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,680
for

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,440
amazon as a whole obviously including

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,399
aws

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,440
to meet the the paris accord 10 years

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,560
early

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,880
and to move amazon itself

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,880
all of our energy used to be renewable

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,959
by 2025

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
and what that really did internally i

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
mean we were already

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
investing in sustainability in several

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
areas but it really stepped up the level

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,760
of investment so

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,280
internally we've been working through

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
you know what does it mean to have this

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,280
as a priority to

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,760
um for amazon to take a leadership

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,319
position on climate rather than sort of

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
working

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,360
through you know what we needed to so

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,960
just keep

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,559
to to sort of be in the middle of the

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
pack

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
and so that's that's what's really

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,360
changed we're also seeing a growing

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,520
demand for companies to make

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
sustainability of focus and disclose

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,200
their climate-related risk

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
as i mentioned we had the amazon

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,120
sustainability data initiative since

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,280
2018 and creating and hosting a data

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,919
commons and open source analytics on top

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,799
of that

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,919
you know open source data is a freely

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,039
supported

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,160
data is an obvious next step

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,000
and uh it's just uh we like i said we've

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
contributed credits and a team and we're

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,799
sort of

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
well underway now in in figuring out

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,799
what it takes to put all these pieces

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
together

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,360
one of the uh one of the great things

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,640
about open source is the way that it

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
enables

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,320
companies that are normally fierce

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
competitors to find

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,320
new grounds on which to collaborate

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
and with amazon and microsoft both part

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
of the

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,440
of the os climate project i'd i'd like

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,039
to get your perspective

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,440
on you know how is it how is it working

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,600
for amazon and microsoft to be playing

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
in this sandbox together

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,960
i think it's really the same as we have

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
with open source there's plenty of

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,679
projects where

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,760
uh aws and microsoft cooperate

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
to to build open source projects

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,480
together so that so

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,520
it's um it's really the the outcome here

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
is a common goal

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,000
it's a common good anything that we do

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
helps the world anything that microsoft

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,760
do helps the world

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
and it applies in the same way so it's

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,960
sort of a positive sum game if you like

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
and the more people we can get involved

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,880
in now as climate the better

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
what we're really seeing though is that

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,919
the current climate modeling marketplace

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
is fractured

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
we need to move to an open source data

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,760
and analytics model we can take out this

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
undifferentiated heavy listing that

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,320
everyone's doing over and over again

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
standardize the data commons and create

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,640
a larger more unified marketplace for

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,360
climate impact modeling

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
and that that's really the goal here and

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,880
then

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,679
really the the leading analytics today

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,679
are based

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,160
the capabilities we have are based on

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,559
open source tooling and common standards

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,919
and you know aws has services to make

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,760
those easy to use

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,000
but it also gives customers the option

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,919
to run those tools

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
those they run their own implementations

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,000
elsewhere

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,280
so we're assembling the contributions on

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,360
github

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
we're extending asdi to include these

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,799
additional data sources

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,440
and we see a few different ways that

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,120
people are going to be using this

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,600
the the idea here is to have a

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,760
multi-tenant service operated by os

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,760
climate you can go to

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,440
to explore the data for free up to

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,679
obviously some limits but

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,840
so basically for people to explore it

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
and figure out what's there

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,280
and then we expect a commercial

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,320
analytics marketplace to emerge for

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,039
enhanced data

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,840
and analytics on top of that that's

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,200
that's the prime

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,200
that's that's where we'll start the

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,799
second thing larger organizations are

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
going to want to run their own private

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
copy of this but since it's potentially

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,280
petabytes of data

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,240
the the sort of easiest thing to do is

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,440
to just

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,600
take the open source setup

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
run it in their own aws account against

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,080
asdi data sources

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,520
and that's a low-cost way that they can

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,280
have their own version of this whole

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,400
thing and build their own analytics on

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
top of that

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,159
then the third approach is that is to

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,960
have a private copy of the data and the

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
code

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,000
running in a data center or on another

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,280
cloud provider

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
and you know this obviously the

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,880
configuration

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,400
tooling around that will be slightly

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,559
different but that we expect to have

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,799
contributed into the project as well

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,080
so the core analytics will be purely

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,640
open source and based on

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,559
open source toolkits and will be

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,559
basically cloud neutral and agnostic

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,520
sorry about that thank you thank you so

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,720
much

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,720
i i noticed that uh we have not gotten a

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,480
lot of questions in the chat which may

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,240
mean that we are so engaging that you

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,559
can't get to your keyboard but if you do

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
have questions you want answered later

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,640
down the road feel free to push them

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,360
into the chat channel or the slack

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
channels and

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,200
we'll get back to you but um in the

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,159
meantime

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
there are a lot of climate data and

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,840
analytics

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,919
initiatives happening and so i'd like to

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
ask truman to talk a little bit about

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,640
what is it that differentiates

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,159
os climate what are the other important

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,600
open source efforts

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:12,080
that our our audience should know about

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,120
um so um you know actually i wanna

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,600
ask michael if you might yourself tackle

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,559
the

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
one of the key first pieces of this so

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,799
there

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,799
i'll talk about some of the other open

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,720
source initiatives

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,280
but there are a number of initiatives

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,440
out there

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:34,480
that um that are openness open that

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,679
that um that say uh we have

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,240
um made our uh our product and code

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,919
open source but they're not so if you

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
want to comment on that

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
sure so as as as many of you may know

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,080
from my bio

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,240
i've been doing open source legitimately

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,960
since before open source existed as a

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,039
term

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
uh starting that world's first company

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,840
back in 1989

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,440
but during that long history there are

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,919
people who have observed

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,120
that using the word open has magical

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,600
marketing properties

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,520
and the open source initiative as an

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,559
organization has done its best

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,960
to make open source licensing really

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,200
mean

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
something the linux foundation has done

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,679
a phenomenal job

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,200
of basically being an honest broker who

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,159
can bring a number of competing

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,799
companies together

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,360
and to work successfully at

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,640
collaborative development and industry

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,280
uh industry-wide initiatives now at the

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,280
same time there continue to be

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,039
companies and investors who are looking

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,480
for how to bring that

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,120
open magic sauce to their uh

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,360
to their play without necessarily

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,000
contributing back or allowing

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,080
for the kind of creative competition

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,720
that true open source and open data

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,760
allow

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,640
but this is something which um

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,559
the uh the real open source community

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,240
knows how to do and we're doing it

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,400
within the umbrella of the linux

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,600
foundation

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,120
great thanks so let me um there are a

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,400
number of different initiatives and

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,760
companies we wanted to make sure the

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,919
audience was aware of

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
this is not comprehensive but um you

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,480
know hopefully it will point you in some

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,400
other directions and

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,120
you know in uh maybe in the networking

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,760
room uh after the session's over we can

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,880
point you to others so there are a lot

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,159
of initiatives and

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,559
and uh that are focused on um more

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,600
efficient trustworthy carbon markets

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,760
um which are going to be crucial for uh

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,919
addressing the uh the low-carbon

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
transition in an economically efficient

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,720
way

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
and then there and then there are others

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
that are focused on specific asset

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,679
classes

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,200
so the open climate foundation is one uh

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,240
that's an example of

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,919
uh of work around carbon markets and and

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,919
by the way they're they're tied in

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,159
uh with um with hyperledger uh

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,039
within the linux uh the linux foundation

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
family

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,240
one that's working on particular asset

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
classes that we're excited about

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,559
is called capital for climate and that

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,640
is uh really much more about

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,000
um as uh large financial institutions

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,039
institutional investors

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,840
um come to understand how they need to

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,600
re

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,120
allocate uh reallocate their portfolios

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,960
this is about deploying capital

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
particularly into

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,440
next generation technologies private

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,240
equity venture stage firms

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,360
so there are also some really very

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
important

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,159
open source initiatives and open data

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,039
initiatives around physical risk

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,080
one that is sort of a bridge and

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,279
servicing

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,279
the the insurance community but also

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,039
all of those all of us because we're all

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,760
insured in multiple different ways

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,679
it's called oasis they're exceptional

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,799
there are some great um

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,520
efforts underway uh to and we'll talk a

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,880
little bit more

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,159
in a minute or two about addressing the

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,080
impacts of climate change

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,559
on the the natural world um biodiversity

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
and

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,559
the the natural world that we depend on

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,840
there's some great things going on

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,720
uh in that on that front in brazil uh so

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
one is called

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,799
uh map and um and then

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
politica por antero backed those are

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,760
backed by the way

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,679
by itau which is the largest commercial

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,200
bank in all of latin america

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,159
and and that will be implemented

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,919
um across uh their the various banking

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,120
platforms in the years ahead

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,559
um so also a really uh interesting area

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,360
that i think touches uh

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,840
a lot of areas of fintech and open

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,679
source

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,679
is around asset level data so

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,240
alternative information on

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,200
what companies are really doing when it

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,640
comes to

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,720
energy emissions water

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,679
and that and that involves for example

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
the use of

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
of ai also spatial data

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
and there's some great organizations

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,799
working on that including geo asset

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,080
in the united kingdom uh part of oxford

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,080
or related to oxford

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,760
and adem which is a um

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
a major quasi-governmental think tank in

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,360
france um

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,720
maybe uh lisa do you have any thoughts

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,520
there

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,799
yeah so uh maybe just to to add to those

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
broader initiatives that truman

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,360
mentioned also also to say that

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
there are also various kind of um you

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,200
know very interesting and ambitious

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,240
startups such as um

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,039
rights based on science uh who uh

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,799
open source at least uh big large parts

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,720
of um

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,520
their yeah their their initiatives their

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
their data or or analytics uh tooling

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,039
and in addition to that i also would

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,120
like to mention uh that

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,200
uh you know of course the the large

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,279
universities um the very established

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,600
climate science modelers

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,799
uh you know these these data sets are

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,600
also open source

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,840
and um yeah certainly something that um

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,840
encourages collaboration also with with

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,120
osc and and feeding

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,559
feeding from from the the academic open

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,559
source

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,559
available data sources as well

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,200
yeah adrian you might have some some

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,039
thoughts on that as well

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
given your work in sustainability over

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,880
the years

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,480
yeah and i've also spent a lot of time

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
working with

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,760
finance companies of various types

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,120
around the world

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,320
and i think the trend that i'm seeing

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,600
is a the need for speed they're seeing

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,799
business agility

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,120
as a survival characteristic and i think

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,080
we

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,600
will see that move from basically the

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,360
organizations that have figured out how

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,200
to build products quickly and adopt new

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,480
technologies quickly that have

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,080
got into open source and

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,080
devops and all of the kind of containers

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
ai machine learning the people that have

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,880
figured out how to adopt those

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,880
technologies are also

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
the organizations that i think are going

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,200
to figure out

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,480
how to they're going to be in the

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,559
vanguard of thinking about

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
sustainability and climate mitigation

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,520
practices

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,600
and i think that the organizations that

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,399
get left behind are the ones which are

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,080
at risk from a commercial point of view

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,720
and what we'll start to see

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,559
is that if you're falling behind here

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,440
you're actually going to start

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,559
getting your value marked down as an

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,520
asset risk

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,159
so i think that that's driving people in

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
in

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,120
everyone in the right direction but i

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,559
think that certainly the winning the

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,840
leading companies are the ones that have

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,159
already figured out

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,720
how to be more agile and how to respond

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,799
more quickly

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,320
that's awesome i want to i want to just

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,880
notice right now

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,480
how much of a there there already is

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,399
there when i started

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,919
promoting this idea of commercial

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,919
support for free software

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,000
it was almost impossible to get people

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,360
excited about it only because it was so

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,919
new and there were so few other people

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,279
doing it let alone consuming it and

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,440
we've heard about

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,480
all these banks we've heard about how

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,799
many uh

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,799
startups and how many governmental

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,080
organizations and policies

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,880
are all converging on this common topic

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,799
and so the opportunity to join in and

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,480
start addressing the climate change

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,279
world within the financial services

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,520
community

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,960
is just awesome but it gets even better

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,159
uh because there are

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,080
open data and uh open uh fintech

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,520
uh solutions being developed that go

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,240
beyond uh

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,320
just uh just the climate and so lisa can

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,080
you talk a little bit about uh

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,200
the world of esg yeah sure i mean of

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
course indeed uh

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,480
there is the broader world of of esg and

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
uh

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,399
you know sustainability in indicators so

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,320
i would say um yeah climate is maybe the

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,559
most concrete and the most

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,760
you know data rich topic to start with

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,039
but i would say

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,360
by no means is that the the only uh one

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,000
to

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,240
to focus on so broader we also see huge

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,760
needs in the market for for more unified

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,960
and um more transparent open um

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,519
data on on broader esg but i would say

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,399
also

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,120
um what's what our team is also really

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,519
looking into

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,039
is actually expanding from climate to

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,679
all the planetary boundaries

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,640
eventually and i mean including for

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,640
example

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,480
um you know what what truman was

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,440
mentioning biodiversity

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,480
and um maybe also you know connecting

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,360
the dots uh

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,120
so so working on the just just

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,679
transition so that connects the e and

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,799
the s

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,120
um uh to me in the esg so

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,000
uh also making sure that uh their social

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,399
inclusion in

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,600
in in the transition uh towards a low

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:49,360
carbon climate resilient economy

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,640
so um i want to say a little bit more

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,840
about the the biodiversity side so

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,880
uh this is um

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,360
so when you talk about sort of next big

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,360
thing

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,200
uh in in terms of sort of what's

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,600
happening in the climate world

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:11,039
um so that it is it's very very much

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,080
increasingly focused on uh not just

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,200
mitigating greenhouse gases and um but

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,640
on uh addressing the catastrophic

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:24,159
loss and and threat of even accelerated

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,080
uh losses of biodiversity um

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,600
and the habitat that biodiversity

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,320
depends on

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,519
this is going to be a a very big thing

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,679
that affects

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,519
a whole range of industries and markets

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,760
and certainly around fintech

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,159
so um it is it is the the top item on

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,200
the

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,480
sort of environment um agenda uh

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,679
for um the european

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,039
union um or or we sort of those climate

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,000
and biodiversity

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,720
and um and that's gonna even increase um

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
and appear

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,760
in a whole range of different

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,559
regulations that are going to create

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,840
need for additional fintech regtech etc

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,840
um because the the french are about to

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,000
take over the presidency of the european

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,120
union and it is their top priority

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,559
um fortunately um uh the the senior

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,320
advisor to the french government on

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,080
these issues is also on our advisory

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,240
board so expect to be closely involved

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,840
there

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,279
that's monique barbut fantastic

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,240
fantastic so

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,279
you know as as if as if just the

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
financial

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,720
climate informed investment opportunity

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,960
wasn't big enough

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,200
uh the social uh dimension the

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,600
governance dimension the biodiversity

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,080
dimension there's a lot to it but as

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,720
truman

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
said this really is all about science

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,240
coming together

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,000
to be able to help us better understand

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,039
our financial decisions uh

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,880
our our priorities and that is why it is

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,720
so important for us to have

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,919
a framework that can become a unified

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,679
framework and so i want to get michael

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,440
to a question that that came in

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,039
um earlier because i think actually this

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,600
is a good point to address it and that

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,039
is

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,320
sort of how uh how does uh does what

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,839
we're talking about here

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,720
connect to other areas of fintech and um

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,119
so i'll give you one example that is is

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,639
just

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,839
hugely exciting and important um so

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,079
mobile payments um is uh you know is

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,119
obviously a massive area of work and

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,480
where there's just been

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,480
uh you know tremendous leap frogging of

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,240
traditional banking models to be able to

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,520
address um

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,000
uh bottom of the pyramid uh to be able

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,800
to

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,720
handle um financial transactions in

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,800
remote areas all over the world

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,919
uh and um and a lot of that has been

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,119
driven and

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,560
and and and enabled by improvements

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,679
um in infrastructure and networking etc

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,359
including through

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,639
um projects of lf networking and others

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,720
so what does that have to do with what

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,280
we're talking about here um

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,079
so it is crucially important to be able

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,960
to have

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,079
actually micro payments um that that

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,440
flow down

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,480
to rural farmers in africa

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,240
to to people that are

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,119
using low carbon high efficiency

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,599
cook stoves as an alternative to you

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,599
know

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,359
basically cooking and heating with with

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,599
dung for fuel

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,280
those are all things that we're through

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,119
through mobile telephony and

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,079
micropayments working through

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,400
the the uh through the telecom system um

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,960
are able to engage and involve those

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,359
people

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,119
um in a way that you know not only uh

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,280
when you add it up across the billions

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,040
of people that um that are

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,000
users of of energy tillers of soil etc

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,040
um not only uh or changes and motivating

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,640
those changes

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,320
um important for addressing climate

00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:00,880
change but also for a just transition

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,359
yeah that's great and so um i think

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,240
another

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,839
another question which is uh on a lot of

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,640
people's mind is uh

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,960
how can they themselves get involved how

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
can

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,320
individuals not just organizations get

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,079
involved and

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,599
um adrian why don't you talk a little

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,359
bit about that

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,440
sure yeah i mean we've had

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,000
obviously in the open source arena it's

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,640
a mixture of corporate contributions and

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,359
individuals who get excited about a

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,520
particular

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,440
area one of the ways that we've seen

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,400
that works pretty well to get people

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,880
excited is to organize

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,960
actually have an organized hackathon and

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,359
that way you can you have

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,320
sort of the core support people in place

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,720
that know

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,880
how the system is currently built can so

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,920
you have some sort of concentrated

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,760
support and just invite people in and

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,400
have everybody just working on different

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,160
aspects of the system so

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,839
um we have we've been organizing

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,599
hackathons around projects

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,839
for a long time all different kinds of

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,359
things so i think that's something that

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,240
we're looking to do as

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,800
as this gets to a point where there's a

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,640
publicly available copy of the code

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,920
um we're looking to try to organize

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,079
various types of

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,359
events around it to sort of promote it

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,280
and gather people

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,880
get get people to to make contributions

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
and figure out how to use the data

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,240
themselves

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,280
hackathons can be an amazing catalyst

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
another suggestion lisa eichler posted a

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,680
link

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,200
to the science-based targets initiative

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,320
tool which

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,359
is just you know it's just one piece

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,359
of this massive massive puzzle and

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,520
i don't recommend trying to consume all

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,720
knowledge about global climate change

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,480
and uh climate aware investing in one go

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,920
but if you wanted to start somewhere and

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,280
just sort of look at how

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,280
a particular piece reaches uh into

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,640
some of the topics that would be a good

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,839
way to also

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,800
get involved so we are in the process of

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,680
building some

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,599
prototypes uh we are not quite yet ready

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,680
to release that code because

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,760
we want it to be something that uh

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,400
people can sort of latch on to and study

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,839
and we're still

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,560
we're still really at the at the

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,599
beginning but as we

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,640
make announcements about the prototype

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,760
availability

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,920
we hope that the awareness that we are

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,160
building through activities like this

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,880
forum are going to

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,160
cue people to look at that work make

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,880
comments criticize

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,880
possibly join that's what that's really

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,079
what the open source uh community is all

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,240
about

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,960
so um i wanna know if um

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,560
uh let's see i'd like we we just have a

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
few minutes left and so i'd like to go

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,400
back to

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,119
uh truman siemens and just to give us uh

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,960
a recap of the near-term vision of os

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,320
climate

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,359
um great so uh thank you and

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,640
again we're very pleased to have the

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,160
opportunity to have um

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:11,520
i've spoken with you all today

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,680
we are very eager for you to

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,280
get involved in the work that we're

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,800
doing

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,520
whether through membership

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
in in os climate and contributions on a

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,160
corporate level

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,280
or as individual contributors and

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,960
and as as we've said we will uh

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
certainly push out through the community

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,040
opportunities

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,280
um or individual developers uh to to do

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,040
that we hope to get uh to that point

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,119
um soon so um uh i i think

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,320
what we we've sort of mentioned in bits

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,839
and pieces here

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,560
uh some um some elements of

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,680
uh our vision for the data commons and

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,040
for analytics

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,680
um so uh just to kind of put that

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,079
um to wrap that together we're focused

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,119
in the

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,240
in the near term on uh on the

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,680
the greatest needs the the most

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,880
uh pressing needs uh of

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,839
uh large sovereign wealth funds pension

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,760
funds

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,200
asset managers and banks for

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,960
understanding and quantifying

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,079
climate-related risk

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,880
understanding and actively investing

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,400
in opportunities for climate solutions

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,880
that are also

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
have uh the risk return profile that is

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,960
required or providing

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,800
uh uh sort of having better credit

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,400
decisions for what they finance

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,480
um uh and uh and for uh at us at

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
a more of a financial system level to

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,839
provide the tools

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,359
that are needed to understand

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,560
climate-related risk across the

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,160
financial system

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,800
uh so um that's the envelope

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,359
for the uh the elements and pieces that

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,560
you've heard

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,280
uh described here today um around

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,560
uh tools for stress testing around uh

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
the science-based targets

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,920
um financial initiative tool uh tools

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,520
for

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,400
um uh assessing uh portfolios of real

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,599
assets

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,760
um uh and other types of portfolios uh

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,040
for physical risk uh and resilience and

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,680
adaptation and

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,319
and investments in resilience um and

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,359
then

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,000
very very importantly accelerating

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,079
toward

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,720
uh the availability of high quality

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,520
comparable data about markets and

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,520
corporations

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,640
that um uh that is um

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,200
uh that is you know

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,680
robust enough essentially to uh to to

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,000
serve

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,720
all of these investment needs um we're

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,440
taking

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,880
uh small steps now toward that maybe

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,359
adrian you can talk about just some of

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,880
the

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,079
immediate steps that are underway

00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,359
um so we're we're currently working

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,720
a way to to get this put together

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,240
the first version we've got some

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,079
internal prototypes that we'll be

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,800
sharing amongst the os climate

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,960
membership

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,560
as we as we go forward we're starting to

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,119
assemble the pieces

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,480
um some of the contributions we're

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,760
expecting to have

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,319
um have something in the next few months

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,280
that

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,119
actually starts to become usable and

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,599
then have a public release sometime

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,720
during

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,520
2021 so that's the schedule we're on

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,800
and i think just going back to the what

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,400
can you do thing i think

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
everybody that works for a public

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,520
company you should know what your public

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,720
company's position

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,079
is on disclosing um

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,760
your targets and if you don't know what

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,480
that is or if your company doesn't have

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,000
a position

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,720
maybe that you can go and ask the

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,280
question back what are we doing

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,040
if uh climate reporting climate impact

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,040
reporting becomes mandatory for all

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,640
public companies around the world

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,240
like what is our position on that i

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,920
think that's a good question and

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,720
you may find that somebody's working on

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,520
it and you can develop that relationship

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,240
and then

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,200
um you know maybe point them out to os

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,839
climate as a

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,880
as a way to help build um that reporting

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,440
information

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,560
adrian i think that's such an excellent

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,880
uh closing

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,760
argument that idea of answering the

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,480
question

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,599
what can i do perhaps the reason that

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,599
climate change has

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,839
become such a large problem is that

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,480
individuals think about that question

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,280
and they can't imagine that practically

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,319
there is

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,200
anything that they can do and yet and

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,160
yet

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,640
this open source development model this

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,119
marketplace of companies who desperately

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,280
need

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,440
breakthrough technologies to be able to

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,920
make correct decisions

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,040
set the stage for that individual

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,560
contributor

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,319
to work with the many many other

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,160
individual contributors who have the

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,960
same question who have

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,520
and answer a piece of the answer to this

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,720
question and so

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,880
time is short but time is now for

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,400
those who have that question what can i

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,520
do to find an

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,359
answer and within their companies bring

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,640
their companies to the table

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,160
at uh as part of the linux foundation's

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,800
climate finance

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,119
group for those of you who are true

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,280
individual contributors

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,319
check in with the os climate project and

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,880
see

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:32,160
when we are ready to to engage the open

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,160
source community more fully

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,480
terrific

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,970
