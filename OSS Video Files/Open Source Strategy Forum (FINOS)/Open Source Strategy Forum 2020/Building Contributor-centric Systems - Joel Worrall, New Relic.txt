well hello everyone

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
um thanks for taking a few minutes to be

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
able to

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,799
sit with me and walk through this

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,960
content

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,880
we're going to be talking about a

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,720
concept that um

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,199
maybe at least the terminology may be

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,480
unfamiliar but hopefully uh

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,080
it is familiar at least in our

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
common name it's called

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
contributor-centric systems

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
and i'm joel wuerl senior director of

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
open source from new relic

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,640
and uh glad to be walking you through

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
this material

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,600
today um so for starters

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
as is always the case i gotta start off

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,079
here with my little safe harbor slide

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
and

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
just say anything that i'm talking about

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,559
related to new relic obviously

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,800
is related to that so um okay

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,680
for starters here uh just give you just

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
a quick

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,440
a moment about me um so i'm uh i'm

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
i currently serve as the senior director

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,879
of open source of uralic

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
um and previously i've worked in new

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,080
relic for about two and a half years

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
in running open source for the last year

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,439
before that i ran a group inside our

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
go-to-market organization called new

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,280
relic labs

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
i've been a chief technologist for a

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,159
non-profit marketing firm

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,520
i've been a non-profit executive and um

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,280
and served at all sorts of different

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,680
levels of

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,960
engineering leadership in product

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,200
companies

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,960
i'm also an open source maintainer and

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
the co-founder of a project that

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720
actually

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,159
i was part of the second application

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,759
based uh project that ever actually

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,840
joined the js foundation

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,880
which i'm going to talk a little bit

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,280
about how i've run marketing

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,320
organizations before um solution

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
architect i've been a

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
been a teacher and developer and i've

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
also been the

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,439
newer customer which is the company that

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
i'm working for these days

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,960
so throughout the interwebs you can find

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,560
me if you're interested

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
at my handle which is almost always

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,040
available which is why i use it

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,960
tango llama okay so here's our agenda

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
we're going to talk about first of all

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
before you

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,920
get all the way through this talk why

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
this talk so i'm going to give you just

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,480
a couple thoughts about why this might

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,680
be valuable for you i'm going to give

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,800
you some background

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,360
um some context about how this

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
concept came about from some of my own

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
experiences we're going to talk about a

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
definition around contributor-centric

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
systems

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,120
i'm going to talk about six principles

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
that i believe have played out in the

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
work that i've done

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,560
around building contributor-centric

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
systems and then offer just a few next

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,519
steps

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,280
for you as you're thinking about

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
exploring this concept applying this

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,200
concept

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,319
hopefully learning with me in the

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,879
process of of building systems

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,360
that uh invite and engage contribution

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,560
and

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,680
engage contributors okay so

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,160
for starters i like this very pointed

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,400
question

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
why is this worth 30 minutes of my time

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
i'll never get back

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
um so i want to just offer up these

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,080
three

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,879
uh potential outcomes so first of all to

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,239
get better as a software professional

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,480
i think uh regardless of which

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
particular discipline we're operating in

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
in the world

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,319
of technology uh whether it's

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,519
architecting systems engineering them

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,879
discovering product needs and fits

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,640
inventing you grow your experiences from

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,920
other people's journeys my hope is by

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,120
presenting a little bit of

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,920
my own journeys in exploring this

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,400
concept it could be beneficial to you

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
um second there's a good chance now or

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,280
sometime in the future

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,879
you will be working on a system that

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
would benefit from

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
some of these ideas some

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,879
contributor-centric ideas

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,480
and um and so that doesn't that's not to

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
imply that every project you do work on

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,200
or even every open source project

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
necessarily should be

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
what i would classify as like a

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
contributor-centric system but

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,000
but but it's very likely that you will

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
be and so perhaps this will be

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
applicable from that perspective

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
and then the third thing is just to

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
change perspective on the way you were

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,720
doing your work

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
just by thinking about how this type of

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,360
concept

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
applies to your own work you might just

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,239
find that you

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
find just a little bit more purpose in

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,280
your craft which i think is one of the

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,919
things that's happened for me

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,759
so um without further ado we're going to

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,400
continue on

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,680
okay so we're going to talk about a

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,199
couple stories first of all we're going

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,199
to talk about

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,880
an anti-pattern to this concept of

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
contributor-centric systems from my own

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,280
background which

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
happens to come from the enterprise

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
learning management system space which

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
is

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,400
certainly not to disparage companies are

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,600
doing good work there but it is to say

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
that there's some experience that i

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
personally

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
had that helped me kind of recognize

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
that it felt like it wasn't aligned with

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
some of the things we're really trying

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
to accomplish and then i'm going to

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,400
point to

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,080
three different examples of projects

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
that i've worked on in my career over

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,400
the last 10 plus years

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,240
that have grown some of my own thinking

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
about what a contributor-centric system

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,639
is

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
um in the non-profit space in the open

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
source space and now

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
working in a commercial entity leading

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,120
open source

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,680
okay so um item number one

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
our anti-pattern and for this we're

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,479
gonna point to

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,960
uh this is of course you've probably

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
seen this before gartner magic quadrant

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,479
this one i think is a little bit older

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,520
but it's meant to chart out in all the

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
leading players that

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,800
exist in a particular sector of software

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,160
one of the things that so i found myself

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,720
working in leading in a learning

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
management company um

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
a decade plus ago and one of the things

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,680
i was always struck with was

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,759
the relationship that we had with

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
learners as a software vendor

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
that was theoretically all about

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,120
learning um

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,520
we we were a system that through

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,560
[Music]

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,720
choice or enforcement had had

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
been rolled out across large enterprises

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
so thousands tens of thousands

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
in some cases hundreds of thousands of

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,479
users are touching the software on a

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,479
regular basis

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,639
and it was clear uh through the way we

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
built features so the way we did our

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
product road mapping through even

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
frankly the way we were evaluating

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
compared with other peers

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
that we were not building the software

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,039
for the learners for the people

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,960
who were like the broadest audience of

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
people that were touching the software

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
really building it for learning

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,120
administrators who are trying to figure

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,479
out how to justify their budgets

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,440
uh to uh their their executives

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,840
um and that created this weird imbalance

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,880
where

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,080
there's just disconnect for me as an

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,560
engineer and an inventor

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
a cognitive disconnect between like the

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,080
power of what existed

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,919
in our learning community and how it

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
could serve

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,400
the ultimate goals we had about

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
retaining and conveying knowledge

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,160
um versus the way we were actually

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,199
thinking about building the software

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,840
so i kind of walked away from that

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
experience uh back uh 10 11 12 years ago

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,880
now

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
with these burning questions in my head

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,599
about what would it mean to actually

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,639
truly engage the the people that you're

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,960
trying to serve

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
in a way that created more uh more

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,199
generous outcomes

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,360
um not in just truly in in some in an

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,440
altruistic way but like ultimately

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
about about building more productive

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,479
systems and accomplishing

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,199
your tasks more successfully i quit that

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,400
job

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,240
um and actually ended up joining um

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
a non-profit actually an organization

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,199
i've been given to for a number of

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
years and i actually joined as their

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
first technologist the first person with

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
any sort of technology background

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,880
and eventually ended up running

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,199
technology and marketing for an

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,039
organization called cure

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360
so this was an organization that

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
operated a set of hospitals all over the

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
world

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
where the focus was on caring for kids

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
with surgically correctable disabilities

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
um and the key thing that we did there

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
that we built a system

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,879
that was my first kind of major learning

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
and discovery around this idea of

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
building contributor-centric systems so

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,240
we were building a system

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,879
at the time when i joined the

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,639
organization we had a problem which was

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
we were doing all this great work 20 000

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,319
plus kids a year that are being served

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,800
and radical transformation in the lives

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,160
of these children and their families

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
but whether you showed up with fifty

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,240
thousand dollars or fifty

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,960
we couldn't connect those dollars to a

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,639
direct

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,160
human that was being held and we had

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
great numbers from a

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
uh reporting standpoint in our 990 but

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,720
ultimately

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,080
there was a lack of connection and so

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
that created not only

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
kind of an opacity in who we were

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,800
serving but even

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,519
um just a real anonymity on the side of

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,200
the people

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
who were funding the work and and

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,159
contributing as well so what we did is

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,120
we built a platform and built a piece of

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
technology

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,880
um called a system called cure kids that

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
was able to connect

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
donors and the people who were being

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
served

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,360
through uh an appropriate level of

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,279
update and

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
communication where we were able out

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,240
some broker two-way communication

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,000
between families

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
so families that were helping fund care

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
and then families that were receiving

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
that care

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,279
um in very generous mutually beneficial

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,800
relationships where they're both

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,480
uh serving one another and we end up

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,200
becoming kind of the conduit for that

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
um so creating some interesting scenario

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
where we actually got

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,080
got the chance to help our donors feel

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,000
like they were directly involved in our

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
work and not just help them feel like it

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
because it was

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,480
beneficial from a fundraising

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,480
perspective although it was

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
um but also to actually get them

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,480
directly involved in some of

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,920
the work that we did through the use of

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
the technology system i'll talk about

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,440
that a little bit more

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,880
i want to get into uh get into some of

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,320
the takeaways

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
the second thing and while i was in the

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,000
middle of working for that organization

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
uh myself and two other co-founders

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
started

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,240
a project that's now part of the linux

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,680
foundation part of the jazz foundation

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,640
called hospital run so uh we

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,000
i was actually on on a trip um visiting

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,000
our hospital in kenya

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
um and had known for a while i was there

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,760
actually checking the efficacy

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
of this patient reporting system that i

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,160
just talked about the cure kids system

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
and uh was fully aware that like we had

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,279
a problem from a medical records

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
standpoint that we needed a second point

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
implement an electronic medical record

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,160
system

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
um but ended up going out on a mobile

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,600
clinic and recognized

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
in a mobile clinic just to be clear is

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,320
like a situation where

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,040
say one of these facilities would

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
get in some hospital vans and then drive

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
maybe

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,279
several hundred kilometers away from

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,800
their facility to do long-term follow-up

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,760
and care

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
and patient identification um in you

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
know

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360
some other neighboring village in in

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,079
order to like ensure that we

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
the continuity care was maintained well

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
we had to carry the records actually out

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
with us out in those scenarios we

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,360
recognized there was a really complex

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
issue there

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
if we're going to try to tackle this

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,240
with a technology system and so what we

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
need to do

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,839
was reluctantly after exploring a lot of

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,120
different options and exploring a lot of

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,760
the open source projects

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,680
that are out there we started a project

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,160
that made use of

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
a technology concept called offline

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,240
first development

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,760
in order to allow you to interact with a

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,440
cloud-based system even when the

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,720
internet's off because we're using local

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,760
storage and then

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,120
some simple but clever synchronization

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,800
capabilities

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
to when you're in range of an internet

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
connection then recognize where you are

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,560
and know which network you can talk to

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
and how to transmit the updates

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
uh appropriately and what we ended up

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,680
having to do was ultimately

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
build a open source project around that

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
and then build

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,160
some way to bake into the concepts of

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,519
what we were building with hospital run

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,440
a contributor centricity so we

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,959
had a number of practices that we

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
started implementing in the way that we

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,880
were managing that project

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
that we're all about make creating an

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,760
environment

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,120
that allowed potential contributors

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
these developers that happened to be at

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
that time building

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
an ember based application since then

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
the projects continued on and it's now

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
react based app but

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
they understood a particular framework

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
and understood a

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,360
particular set of technology and carried

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,040
that knowledge into the conversation

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,040
but didn't necessarily understand the

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
domain perfectly so how do we find ways

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,240
to help people feel connected and get

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,959
connected to that work

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,079
in service to this common mission and

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,720
there are a lot of interesting

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,240
challenges that we face along that way

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
and what it meant to like discover what

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
does it actually mean to be

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
contributor-centric

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
what are the things that aid your

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,480
ability to recruit

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,680
and encourage and maintain contributors

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
some of which are a little bit

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,720
counterintuitive and i'll talk a little

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,760
bit about those when i get into

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
sections on on lessons learned a third

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,240
piece

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,480
of of input here is actually on

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
uh the work that i'm doing right now uh

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
related to new relics so

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
um i joined new relic as i said about

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
two and a half years ago and then took

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,720
over the

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
open source organization um actually

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,800
really we

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,279
really started it back in october of

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,040
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,959
and like a lot of other organizations

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,639
there was a lot of uh

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,680
tending work to be done in order to help

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,480
us discover policy implement that policy

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,839
um create culture around what did it

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,160
mean for us to

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
open source more of our capabilities as

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,680
an organization

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,200
and nowadays we've open sourced

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
basically our entire

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,279
instrumentation library so all our

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
agents and capabilities soon to be our

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,839
capabilities

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,079
from a browser and mobile perspective

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,399
are all now out in open source

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,760
and some of that was actually driven by

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,279
a lot of the work that came out of the

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
open source engineering team not that we

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,720
had done conducted all that work

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
that we kind of led the way on what does

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,079
it mean to create a

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
contributor-centric culture and so we

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
did things like

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,199
um release our open source website so

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,320
you can go to opensource.netrelic.com

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,199
this is a

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,040
screenshot of it um and that of course

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,480
itself is an open source project right

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,959
so our website that's

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
focused on promoting these hundreds of

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,160
projects that we have in our open source

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,839
library on github

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,839
is itself an open source project built

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,800
in gatsby that invites

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,320
things like direct contribution to the

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
maintenance and management of the site

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
so

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
you'll find that on every page there are

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,959
things like editing capabilities that

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
drive you

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,440
directly into an interface that you can

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,680
quickly edit in pr

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,519
um all focused on this idea of like

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,600
recognizing if someone's willing to take

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,760
an action to contribute

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
in say even a language change on

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
something that could be a good basis to

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
try to determine whether or not you've

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
got someone

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,399
who might be interested in being

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,839
involved in some of the other projects

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,320
you're involved in

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,279
and ultimately all in service to the

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,199
mission we have

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
which is not about new relic's bottom

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,560
line i mean that's

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
sort of an outcome from executing our

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,000
mission

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
we're really focused on making

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,360
observability ubiquitous

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,760
and and accessible to to

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,199
all engineers and so we recognized that

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
doing more work in open source

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,240
uh was necessary to to achieve that and

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
that uh to to create the kind of

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
relationships with the community

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,320
that makes it possible to um to build

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
those sorts of things like we need to

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
reflect that

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,639
in for ourselves to change our or adjust

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
our own

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
perspectives and attitudes as well as um

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
in relationship with our potential

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,360
contributors

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
how do we build systems that invite that

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,079
contribution

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,839
so that leads me to um some learning so

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,880
having been in the nonprofit space and

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,920
the open source

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,880
uh directly in direct open source

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,800
contribution

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,639
working in a commercial setting um

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,399
leading open source

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,920
i want to talk a little bit about some

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,959
common ground um

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,959
that i've uh uh discovered between

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
open source and nonprofits um that i

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
think can be beneficial in thinking

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,920
about this concept

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
of contributor-centric systems okay so

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,320
item number one

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,120
um both open source and non-profits or

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
causes

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
um are and this is the case for

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
foundations or

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,639
you know for uh for any sort of 501c3 or

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,839
if you're international

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,160
uh based on the governance laws of your

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,120
your locale whatever qualifies as a

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,800
nonprofit

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
that these two things are pursuing a

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,079
larger goal than full-time central staff

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,000
can achieve you're always

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
tackling a mission that's bigger than

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,959
you can staff up for

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,320
um that is a uh that's a that perhaps a

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,040
challenge that's faced even in many

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
commercial

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,720
ventures but i would i would argue

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,759
having been lived on both sides of that

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,199
equation um that it is certainly far

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,040
more challenging and

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,800
requires far more uh invention and

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,320
necessary investment on the nonprofit

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,880
side and definitely on the open source

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
side

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
um you are are trying to tackle

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
something that's really difficult for

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,839
you to hire up to solve

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,920
the second thing is you're relying on

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
participation where financial benefit is

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,959
not a primary driver so in the case that

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,720
you're

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,399
you know perhaps like most of our work

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
settings

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
we probably are working someplace

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,959
because um

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
we like the people we're working with

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,639
hopefully we believe in the mission of

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,040
the

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
work that we're doing um there certainly

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,759
is a financial benefit that's a driver

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,000
for our work

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,480
that's not the case i mean there are in

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
many countries tax write-offs related to

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,560
um non-profit contribution and certainly

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,839
there are some scenarios where open

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
source contributors are paid but

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
certainly not

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
the sort of thing that's meant to make

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,799
you rich and famous

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,199
so that's not the primary driver and and

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,799
that creates a different sort of

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,640
requirement in the way that you

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,640
construct your project

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
the third thing they both have missions

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
that tend to be best served by a broader

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,799
circle

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,480
so um the the work tends to get better

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,799
as more people are involved this is not

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,559
the

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,080
true of every single project or

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,320
certainly not every project

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
in a commercial setting but in this

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
particular case

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
these tend to be true about open source

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
and non-profit and therefore

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,039
uh they need vibrant relationships with

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,400
contributors and so you've got to build

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,600
connections with people who you

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,520
desperately need in order to achieve

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,120
ultimately achieve the further extent of

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,200
what you want to do with your mission

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,559
okay so this leads us to a question of

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
this this concept of a

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,120
contributor-centric system

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
so let's talk about what is a

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,720
contributor-centric

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
system so i've got a definition here so

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
a contributor-centric system

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,160
is a system technology and processes

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,640
built to support and

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,160
align people who are in a sustained

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
relationship with an organization that

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
champions a mission

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
the resulting system enables a virtuous

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,080
cycle of mutual service to a common

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
cause

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,160
so think about this as like a scenario

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
where as opposed to

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,400
you may build software to serve a

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,840
customer but in this case actually

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,000
the customer that you're serving is

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,440
actually related to like a larger cause

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,840
that you're involved in

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,039
and in the the best definition and the

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,120
best implementations

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,960
of a contributor-centric system the

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
technology systems that support these

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,400
things

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,200
um the contributor the customer that

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
you're serving

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
actually feels like they are a part of

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
the actual mission

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
because of their engagement with the

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,039
technology or contribution to the

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,720
technology

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,080
so that's uh that's kind of a unique

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,080
factor that

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,400
that i i would use as a definition for

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
what a contributor-centric system is

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,039
you're not just giving to the cause

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
you're part of the cause because you're

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,600
a part of it

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
um uh so what does this look like in the

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,760
case of

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
nonprofits okay so um in a non-profit

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
setting

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,520
this is a platform that moves a

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
charitable conversation about

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
that's normally related to time or you

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,320
know some sort of time or

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,720
finances that are being uh contributed

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,480
from what you is the organization

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,960
delivering this service do

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
that the donor supports into what we as

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,640
a community

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
do to serve the common mission their

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,440
time attention and resources

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,520
um and if you're

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,559
an engineer like me and like tend to be

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,600
a little bit more

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,039
uh uh skeptical so we'll really like

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,039
what's it is and it's just semantics

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,240
well no i mean there is an actual

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,200
um uh identification and emotional

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,200
posture

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,039
that contributors can feel towards a

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,600
particular cause

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,039
that can be enabled it's very common for

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
a contributor to feel like they are sort

00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,520
of

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,720
separate from the entity but there is a

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,280
moment

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,880
and that comes at a level that's about

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,240
more than money right or about more than

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
time it's actually about like

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
participation really feeling like

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,440
they're participating in the mission

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
um i've seen this play out in more than

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
one scenario and it's it's definitely

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,159
possible

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,600
in an open source project it's about

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,080
building a project and tooling and

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,520
processes that encourage maintainers who

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,559
are the primary people acting on the

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,159
project

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,520
to engage contributors in an

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,159
ever-growing sustainable connection

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,200
towards

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,760
uh shared service of the project i know

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,559
i want to emphasize here indicate and

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,559
i've got here as an

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,320
example the new relic developer site

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,880
which itself is also another open source

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
project

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,720
that invites contribution on every

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,679
single part of the part of the

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,960
uh the site itself okay i want to want

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
to highlight here that

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
it is not my assumption and this is i

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,919
suppose debatable

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
but that i'm offering an opinion here

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,520
not every open source project is

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,039
a contributor or should be a

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,600
contributor-centric project

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,880
but many many open source projects are

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,400
best served

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,720
by a broader circle of contributors

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
joining in ever increasing uh

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,640
relationship and commitment

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,080
to the effort um i'm not talking about

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
you know scatter shot hundreds of

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
thousands of people contributing

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
to a project but continuing to grow the

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,480
circle of people that are

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,320
invested and feel invested and feel that

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,240
that's a good use of their time

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,200
okay so um the question is let's say if

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
we if we can take

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
uh as a given or at least as a

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,640
hypothesis that a contributor-centric

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,480
system is a real thing

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,600
and is a thing that we're interested in

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,080
in investing in i want to offer up just

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
six principles from that history that i

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,360
just talked about

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,480
from this definition that i'm offering

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,520
uh around

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,039
building a contributor-centric system or

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
creating a mission-aligned experience

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,039
that provides contribution

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,640
so here are the like six principles uh

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,600
some of these they blend between

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,440
you know kind of marketing and

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
positioning and then into the

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
implementation of technology

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,799
so here we go item number one um so i

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,200
uh just told a story uh just a minute

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,559
ago about the invention of hospital run

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,480
um this uh this photo that i brought up

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,880
here is actually uh directly related to

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,679
that story so this was uh literally the

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,600
hospital

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
uh the day that hospital run as a

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,159
concept really was born

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,280
i was going out on this um this mobile

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
clinic we were going to drive a couple

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
hundred mile

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,039
kilometers away from the hospital the

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,440
hospital building was right behind us

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,960
there was a bit bigger quite beautiful

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,159
actually just such a lovely place

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,159
but um we we uh we dropped

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,760
these paper records those are doctors

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,799
that are loading

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,559
uh large uh heavy pieces of material

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,919
onto their ambulances so that we could

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,919
carry our best

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,200
guests based on the region of the number

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
of people that we might

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,559
need to interact with and and let's hope

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,280
that we got the right

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,799
information with us and recognizing that

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
if we wanted to carry those medical

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,600
records

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,720
on an electronic device out into the

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,840
field

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,480
and then allow a staff that was not

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,880
uh profoundly technically gifted

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
although

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,440
incredibly gifted capable people who are

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,039
certain brilliant brilliant people but

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,600
not necessarily

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,520
technically gifted that we needed to put

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,200
them in a position where they could just

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,840
interact with the device and when they

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,600
walk back into their own local network

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
it just syncs up and works and they

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,120
don't have to pay attention to it at all

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,559
and that was really the focus of what we

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
wanted to do with the hospital

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,640
and so this um this first point here is

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,600
really all about remembering who you're

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
serving and why

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,440
so a contributor-centric system is we're

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,280
building hospital ryan we recognize that

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
we needed to bake a bunch of experiences

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
into the way we ran the project that was

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,400
actually focused on not these

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
people but the contributors that were

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,799
actually going to help us get where we

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
wanted to go

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,559
but we wanted to be really clear about

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
who we were serving and why because the

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,120
contributor

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,279
isn't interested in feeling like this is

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,400
all about them we were actually serving

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,559
a larger mission

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
which is to serve these people these

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
people who are dedicated medical

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,520
professionals taking care of children

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,760
um or are any any folks that happen to

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
be

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,799
operating in a in a majority world

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,720
context

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,000
um where maybe there's a resource

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
constraint particularly related to the

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,880
healthcare system

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,360
so those are the people we're serving

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
our value uh valuing that precision

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,960
about who that primary customer

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,480
is was super important so as we started

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,080
building hospital run

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,840
we recognized this technology is pretty

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,799
great and actually the interface was

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,200
beautiful

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,440
and so there was a strong pull to move

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
it into like lots of other vectors of

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,559
you know what you can do in western

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
medicine and we would say well it's an

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,400
open source project you want to do that

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,640
4k

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,440
and go do whatever you want but we're

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,600
hurt here

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,720
for this mission that's the reason we're

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
doing this work

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,840
and so that actually um perhaps

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,440
counter-intuitively

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,799
focused what types of contributors we

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
brought to the project and made it

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,960
possible for us to build more

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,559
cohesiveness

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,960
and actually make a lot of progress in

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,080
things like translation of the

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,320
original platform anyway that's the

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,159
they're the reason that primary customer

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,120
these these in this case these positions

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,720
were the reason

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,760
that we had common cause with our

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,120
contributors for the people were

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,640
actually trying to serve

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,720
for the way we had constructed the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,760
project the second thing

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,159
um communicate the mission clearly so um

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,919
this

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,320
again there's a couple counterintuitive

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,880
ideas here um that i that i want to

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240
really

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,840
uh hammer home um often when we start

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,919
particularly when it comes to

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,960
uh not well nonprofit costs as well as

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
open source

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,600
projects you're kind of searching for an

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,799
idea and i just say that like the the

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,080
faster you can get to a place where

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,520
you're you have conviction about the

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,039
mission that you're on

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,400
um again counterintuitively it casts

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,760
casting a broader net um it's actually

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,679
unproductive you end up

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,200
meeting a lot of people who kind of like

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,919
your idea

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,480
versus being super clear about what the

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,640
thing you're doing is for

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,080
that actually helps people select in

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,080
around to be a part

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,200
of the journey that you're asking them

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,799
to enroll in

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,080
um and so i just want to encourage like

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
you've got to communicate that mission

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,440
clearly

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,520
have conviction now that's not to say

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,679
that you can never evaluate like what

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,279
what that mission is and adjust it but

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,720
you can't do it haphazardly

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,159
i mean you have to be intentional about

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,520
that you you have to and you have to be

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
intentional about the communication if

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,600
it turns out you are changing that

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
mission i would say

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,200
anytime you do it's fraught with danger

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,760
that you know the people who were there

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
before

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
have to select in or out like are they

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,720
still on that journey with you

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:32,400
and so be really clear about that

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,600
item number three um contributors want

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,600
norms

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,840
and they want options so again this is

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,120
this may seem particularly when it comes

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,960
to things like

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,480
nonprofit donations this may seem

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:52,080
a little bit counter-intuitive so

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,679
people intrinsically understand

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,360
when they're contributing to work that

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,679
they can do whatever

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,880
you wouldn't arrange whatever they want

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,400
to help

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
um so telling them that is not as useful

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,840
as you might think

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,520
actually the most useful thing to do is

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,480
to tell people what we

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,080
new people normally do so the phrase you

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,520
know i've got borrowed here

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,679
you know people people from from south

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,360
godan is you know people like us do

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,919
things like this this this idea that

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,679
like

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,600
it's unintuitive but in fact people want

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,000
to be told this is what people regularly

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,480
do

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,640
you should do this too with of course

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,399
the option that you know you can

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,240
do whatever you choose to do to be a

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,919
part of the project um

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,279
and we can do this in the way that we

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,760
set norms say in our open source

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,760
projects

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,039
around things as simple as project

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,039
templates and

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,240
you know how we enforce things like test

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,919
coverage in

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,480
the work that's submitted but really

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,159
setting some real clarity around

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,919
around a generous posture towards the

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,240
way we're communicating with one another

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,720
but

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,440
part of the generosity can be to be

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,919
really clear about what our norms are

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,520
again it lets people select self-select

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,720
in and out of what you're doing from a

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,200
project standpoint

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
and also give some people handles on you

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,880
know how do they

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,320
fit into into the potential community

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,440
that you're inviting them

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,640
into so contributors want

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,880
norms with options number four

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,559
um contributor engagement has to be a

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,720
primary requirement

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,919
it's not enough to just say we've got a

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,480
great mission

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,080
we're serving this group um don't you

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,399
want to help

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,440
you need to be intentional in the way

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,919
you bake features

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,200
into your project or into your in your

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,919
project whether that's a non-profit

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,480
project or

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,360
an open source project that make it

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,840
really clear

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,200
signal to users or potential users

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,600
potential contributors

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
that we want you to get involved so we

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,320
make that easy we make it contextual

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,360
so in the case of if you go to the open

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,279
source website

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,480
clicking on that edit edit page or

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,559
create an issue doesn't just

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,600
sort of randomly dump you into the

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,360
github repo

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,279
it takes you directly to the page you're

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,159
looking at right now where i can now

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,799
go into the edit interface and issue a

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,880
change

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,080
submit a pull request and then we've got

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
systems

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
about how we're going to validate that

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,080
and check it and communicate back with

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
you

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,360
um and ultimately in some situations

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,360
kind of reward you

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,799
for that work as well so we're being

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,559
really contextual and we feel like

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,520
pulling some of those

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,080
um some of those user experience issues

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
um

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
off the table as like additional

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,240
complexities what we're trying to signal

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,880
to the user

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,640
is we want you to be a part of this um

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,679
if you're interested we're interested in

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,919
helping you along with that

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,520
process and so the question is you know

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
what can you do to make contributor

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,399
experience

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,679
a key feature make a sense of openness

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,080
and welcome into the mission

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,360
and treat every interaction as a chance

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,880
for someone to self-identify that

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
they're interested

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,480
um number five make the experiences

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,720
personal

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
um so we built one of the best features

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,880
we built when i was working in cure

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,480
was we built a platform that was just a

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
really simple concept it was all about

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,240
just sending get well messages

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,240
to someone in one of our hospitals so we

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
had a group of embedded bloggers

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,840
when you wrote a message as a

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,840
contributor it got sent

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,440
through this embedded blogger they could

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,799
review it for content and like

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,840
ensure that like there's you know

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
everything's uh appropriate there

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,760
but ultimately they'd be able to have

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,480
use it as a tool to actually have direct

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,919
engagement

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,200
with some of our patients and this was

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,960
not just some gimmick it

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,399
had a tremendous effect in the lives of

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,679
these families who

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,200
appreciated the fact that someone on the

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,399
other side of the world cared about what

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,760
was happening to them

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,720
and had been directly involved in it and

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,200
were willing to take the time to

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,720
communicate and often wrote back and so

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,880
there was some two-way communication we

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,919
were capable of brokering and so

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,200
there's a natural sense specifically as

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
technologists

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,840
we tend to think about these efforts as

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,760
like the technology sort of dehumanizes

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,200
these experiences and i would just

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,640
encourage that like i've seen in the

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,320
very best scenarios of a

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
contributor-centric system

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
the technology actually enhances the

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,600
human connection

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
you can use the technology to shrink the

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,039
world and make

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,240
people talk to other people or engage

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,799
with other people in ways that are

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,519
appropriate meaningful

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,640
in ways that like help you just

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,760
recapture and remember

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,200
and and and assert and welcome someone

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,720
else's humanity

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,960
and so just want to encourage you like

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,919
that needs to be a key thing what can

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,919
you do to make experiences personal

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,760
use the technology to shrink the gap and

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,720
the last thing there's always a question

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,640
when you're related to

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,720
kind of these contributor projects

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
around incentives is it okay to have

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,320
incentives should you

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,840
give things away in relationship to like

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,399
contributing to a particular project and

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,240
i would say

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,840
absolutely but and the but here

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,600
is that relationship is really the

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,600
incentive um

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,640
so you may have recognitions and rewards

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,640
in your project

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,519
um and you know uh sending someone

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,559
you know a thumb drive or you know or

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,880
anything you know a hat

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,760
or socks or a t-shirt or you know even

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,760
something more

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,320
you know extensive um is fine

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,919
but um you know there's there's plenty

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,440
of hackathons where like you can win a

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,640
lego set and someone enjoyed the fact

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,760
that they did that thing

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,120
and they like the legos um you know but

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,399
like that doesn't mean that they're in

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,000
not really they haven't really indicated

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,120
much of anything what they indicated was

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,880
that they liked winning

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,880
or you know but there's there's not

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,960
relationship that you're building there

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,720
so what i encourage is that like you

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,559
have to recognize

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,320
the relationship to the project and the

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,720
cause and what you are collectively

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
doing

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,360
is actually the incentive that's the

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,519
thing that you own and you're stewarding

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
and anything you offer from a

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,360
recognition

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,399
reward perspective needs to be about

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,240
enhancing that

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,919
you know so if you've got swag that swag

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,600
is about tribal identity maybe it's

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,159
something you can't buy

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
on some store you can only get it earned

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,320
like through your engagement with the

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,080
project

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,519
you know there's an ongoing relationship

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,440
about what you're going to do

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440
with your open source contributors on an

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,679
annual basis people that continue

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,279
to stay connected to the project it all

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,559
those rewards and recognitions

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,880
are about feeling good about the fact

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,320
that you're connected to the community

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,039
and so you need to remember

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,559
relationships the key incentive

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,159
so with those six ideas um

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,960
here's what i want to offer just to

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,799
close our time just three questions

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,440
to ask and answer on the journey of

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,120
creating a contributor-centric system

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,960
and so here we go item number one

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,640
the question to ask yourself are we

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,080
communicating an opportunity that

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,320
invites engagement

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,440
um what is it about the project that

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,279
you're working on the mission that

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,120
you're engaged in

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,880
that leaves room um for

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,399
focused investment from a group of

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,440
people that are aligned

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,600
uh with the work that you want to do

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
have you created that space and if you

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,640
if you haven't

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,919
is there space for it it could be that

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
there isn't in which case then

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,600
you know maybe that's the strategic miss

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,720
it could be that that's just where your

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,559
project is but

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,640
this can help you kind of like discern

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,720
if there's a a place for

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,320
more um contributor-centric features

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,519
which leads to what features can we

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,360
build or implement and invite

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,159
contributors to grow in their direct

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,960
participation so as we look across our

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,119
project

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,399
where are the places where we can invite

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,159
contributors to growing their direct

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,359
participation how can make it easier for

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,760
them to do that

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,839
so that they they get the win and feel

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,919
connected

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,320
and ultimately we use the technology

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,119
to enhance and sustain person-to-person

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,879
interaction

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,720
with any of these things if like your

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,960
entire flow of the

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,480
the work that you're building to help

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,520
engage with contributors

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,280
doesn't result at some point with some

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,919
way whether it's through newsletters or

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
engagement

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,560
or meetups or uh you know or video

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,119
conference calls or you know or even

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,040
direct

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,480
person-to-person interaction to the way

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,760
you respond in issues

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,679
and pull requests if it's not actually

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,440
uh enhancing a sustained

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,800
person-to-person interaction

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,200
i'd say that like you've still got work

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,480
to do um and we do as well i mean in the

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,480
work that i'm doing right now

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
we have a lot of miles to travel four

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,680
kilometers depending on where you are

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,480
um to travel in what it means to

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,599
build a contributor-centric uh uh

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,960
platform

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,320
okay so um that's my talk and

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,839
i just want to as a final uh kind of

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,960
call to action i just say

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,280
there's a slack uh for new relic users

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,680
called new relic users.slack.com

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,880
you can join that slack and we have a

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,000
public channel called contributor

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,760
centric systems

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,040
if this content is something that's

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
interesting to you

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,079
i just encourage you if you're

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
interested in engaging further

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,119
i'm in that slack channel and i engage

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,680
there on a

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,960
pretty regular basis love to talk to you

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,320
about this further i i

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,160
built this presentation or the whole

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,680
concept around this actually as a

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,320
learning exercise for myself to think

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,079
about

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,760
a lot of the work i had been doing and

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,040
to learn more

00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,400
in this uh this area and so uh perhaps

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,079
i can we can learn together so that's uh

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,839
that's it for my presentation and i just

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,040
want to thank you for uh

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,520
taking the last half hour or so um to

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,880
to to go through it and i i hope that

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
you have great success

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,400
in considering and building your own

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:22,800
contributor-centric systems

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,800
