creating an inclusive digital community

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,480
i am the author of corporations

also i am the host of refinitive

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,080
sustainability

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
perspectives where we talk to

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,239
institutional investors

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
c-suite leaders and others in the

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,360
sustainability

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,559
esg and dni space about how to move

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,879
our sustainable communities forward and

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
i

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,480
am the director of risk and

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
environmental social

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,079
and governance partnerships at

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,360
refinitive so

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,039
what i know well is partnering is

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,160
collaborating to move toward a goal

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,879
what i also know well is risk

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
the damage that risk can do to our

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,000
businesses

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,960
the damage it can do to our marketplaces

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
and also

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,479
how can we take risk and build

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
opportunities from them

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,880
in today's digital environment in our

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,040
remote workplaces where

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
we have days filled with microsoft teams

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,119
meetings and

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,080
zoom coffee breaks there is an

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,040
overwhelming

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,240
need for social capital that's primarily

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
gained from

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
one on one interaction between

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,119
colleagues

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,320
between manager and employee

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,079
now when we don't get these interactions

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
right when these interactions don't lead

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,759
to productivity

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,360
there's an inherent risk there to our

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,479
business to our profitability

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,439
and even to our relationships an

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,200
actual digital remote community which is

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,479
what we're living in now

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,600
it requires deliberate effort

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:04,320
toward exemplary treatment of

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,439
colleagues of those in our communities

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,759
that's what i'm going to speak about

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:12,959
today i'd like to first share with you

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,520
the ideal the aspirational goal of

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,879
what an inclusive digital community can

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
look like

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,280
from there we'll explore the benefits of

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,480
an inclusive digital community

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,920
and finally we'll commit to a simple

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,120
four step plan to build an inclusive

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
digital community in those steps we're

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,280
going to start

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,160
right now the first one is committing

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,160
to introspection and core principles

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
now i first want to talk about the

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,640
notion of community ship

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,239
what does it mean to have a community

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
even before we get to the introspection

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,360
piece

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,640
there was a 2009 harvard article harvard

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
business review article

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,760
and it talked about the term community

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,319
ship and it

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
defined it as the space between

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
leadership

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,280
and collective citizenship and at its

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
center

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
it talks about the need for leadership

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,239
not be egocentric to not

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,599
focus on a top-down framework

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,720
instead it's leadership that includes

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,800
reaching out to employees not reaching

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,680
down to them

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:31,040
leaders welcome they invite

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,840
they engage what happens

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
when communities feel disengaged versus

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,879
when they feel engaged

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
let's get to the engaged first according

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,080
to a gallup report called what is

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
employee engagement

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,720
and how do you improve it engaged

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,120
employees and teams experience a 17

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,760
increase in productivity and for those

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,480
of you in sales this one resonates

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
engaged employees in sales experience a

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,400
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,239
increase in sales so we talk about

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
productivity levels from

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,400
engagement with employers with employees

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
with our entire

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,360
business community the business

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,519
rationale behind this

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
is clear not to mention the social

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,799
aspect of it

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,359
but this isn't just true in the employee

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,720
level

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,880
now i don't know if you how many of you

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
have heard of the role model effect but

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,280
essentially

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
it says that when we see someone who

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
looks like us or is really like us in

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
some way that

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,759
it makes us feel validated and that it

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,280
empowers

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,360
us to ascend in business careers our

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
political careers or whatever industry

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,160
you're interested in

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,400
and i can talk from experience there

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,440
when i was a young child

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,479
i would be so enamored with watching

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
oprah 4 o'clock p.m eastern standard

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,000
time

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,960
3 central time monday through friday

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and i loved her work i loved her mission

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
the people that she brought

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
on it just seemed fascinating but what

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
was also fascinating

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
is that oprah looked so much like me she

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
was

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:09,759
black like me she was a woman like me

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,919
and she also lived in a state

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
where i was born she she lived full time

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
in tennessee just like me

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
and because of that i felt that i really

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,880
could achieve

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
some of the things that she achieved in

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
the areas of writing and in the areas of

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,520
journalism

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
that's just one example of the role

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,960
model effect

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
i've experienced by this myself i'm sure

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,600
many of you have so if we look at that

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
aspirational goals particularly those of

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
us who are in our careers and people who

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,800
might be a bit more

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,639
junior looking to senior management

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
looking to executive teams

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,000
to understand what they can do how they

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
can progress

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
let's take a laser-focused view into

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,160
that and let's talk about the benefits

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,440
of that sort of engagement we find that

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,080
at the senior levels where

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,319
we have the impact of the role model

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,240
effect where junior

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,440
employees can look at those senior level

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,960
employees

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,680
we see that there is a disconnect

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
we see that in an environment where

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
senior level

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
employees are that there is

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,919
unfortunately

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
a lack of a lot of diversity in those

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
senior levels

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
in those business communities as a

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
matter of fact

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,160
a 2019 mckenzie study found that

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,360
executive teams that were in the

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,479
top quartile in terms of the numbers of

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
diversity around culture and ethnicity

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,479
and race

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
they outperformed those companies that

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,400
were in the

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,520
bottom quartile by 36 percent

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,880
more profitability those teams

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,720
saw 36 percent more profitability

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,520
just based on who they had in their

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,280
leadership in their communities

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
now let's look at the role that equity

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,599
plays in your community and

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
community building according to a lean

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,120
in survey women in the united states

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,240
make about 18 percent

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,440
less than men but for women of color

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,479
women like me

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,880
the disparity is even greater

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,639
on average white women make about 79

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,479
cents for every one dollar

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,319
a white man makes asian women make about

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,840
90 cents for every dollar the white man

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,960
makes black women

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,160
make 62 cents about for every dollar a

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,280
white man makes

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,800
native american women 57 cents latinx

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,800
women 55 cents for every one dollar

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,160
a white man makes now we talk about

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
engagement and

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,680
employees really showing up enthusiastic

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,479
about what they do and

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
how that can translate into engagement

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,319
and

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
sales and productivity

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
but when we have such a large number of

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,120
our communities

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,479
essentially all women in our communities

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,840
who are experiencing

00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:01,440
such a lack of parity to this extent

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,440
this greatly damages our efforts toward

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,319
community building it's also

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,479
a risk to our communities as i mentioned

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
before i am a risk professional and one

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,440
of the key

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,400
risks that firms and businesses and

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,000
units and departments communities one of

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
the biggest risks they experience

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
is reputational risk

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,759
investors are those individuals who are

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,400
buying stock into our companies as well

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,320
as

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,760
institutional investors those huge

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
pension funds and

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,039
and mutual funds who are buying large

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,159
amounts of stock into our companies

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,560
they are aware of reputational risks and

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
if

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,080
they see those types of behaviors around

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,720
pay parity around lack of inclusion

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,640
and lack of engagement and diversity at

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,920
the senior levels

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
sometimes they consider not investing in

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,560
companies

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,320
that's a risk also for those of us who

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,640
are interested in having the best and

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,160
brightest in rit departments

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,200
in our cto offices those prospective

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
employees

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
see those behaviors lack of pay parity

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,080
lack of inclusion

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
and they may choose to not become part

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,519
of our talent pools

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,160
that is a risk to our communities

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
and finally very importantly our

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,440
customers

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,519
who hear about perhaps lack of

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,959
engagement from employees

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
hear about pay disparities lack of pay

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,120
parity

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,360
and those customers who choose to

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,680
disengage because their values

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
are not aligned with the values of a

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,440
company

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,839
that considers to continues to condone

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
these unfair practices those customers

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,200
can disengage

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,200
we're hearing a lot about those customer

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,399
groups and the values that we're seeing

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,079
now of millennials of gen z

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,120
of some gen x and as these

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,640
people these demographics continue to

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,920
grow continue to purchase continue to

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,440
invest with a value with

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,320
their values heart placed with

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
that sort of inclusion that presents a

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
risk to our business

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
when we have demographics of people who

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,200
have different values than our

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,720
businesses have particularly

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,279
as it relates to inclusion and diversity

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
and equity businesses must get this

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,720
right

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,120
and the way they can get this right is

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
through

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
their communities so now we're going to

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
talk

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,959
about introspection i hope i've

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,440
clarified goals around what a digital

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,800
community can be the aspirational goal

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,640
as well as the business case for why

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
there are benefits for an inclusive

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,880
community and now we want to talk about

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
introspection

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,640
first we have to do the introspective

00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
work that's the first step to get to

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
those

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,519
inclusive communities leaders have

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,880
responsibility to serve

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,560
and support their employees and to do so

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,120
effectively will require

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
some introspective work and this means

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,399
examining our own

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,240
biases our motives our agendas why do we

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,760
do what we do why do we behave in the

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,959
way that we behave

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,959
now this step is often overlooked um

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,880
in favor of what i call the more

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
practical questions we ask ourselves and

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
that could be

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,440
how can i enhance this product what type

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
of integration do i need for this new

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
product

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
how can i build out this api those are

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,079
questions that many

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,480
tech leaders cto officers i.t officers

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,320
ask themselves and whereas they are

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,440
important questions

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,480
we also need to analyze our

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,519
actions in the same way that we analyze

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,160
our products

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
as leaders we're often asked to analyze

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
and think about how

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,800
other people can improve how processes

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,000
can improve

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:08,240
this step asks us to ask ourselves

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
how can we improve

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,040
successful leadership requires this

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
analysis of our behaviors and it's

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
important to take a judicious approach

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
whether we're talking about

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,320
looking at our products or whether we're

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,839
talking about looking at ourselves

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,000
regular introspection helps us align our

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,320
actions with our personal truths

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
and helps to reinforce confidence in our

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,480
abilities to

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,440
innovate and to make decisions and to

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
execute ideas we're able to do that

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,200
because

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we're clear on what our agenda is and we

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,279
can align that to the company's agenda

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,680
a 2017 boston consulting group article

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
explained that critical thinking leads

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,880
ceos in addressing

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,160
immediate challenges but reflective

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,519
thinking

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,440
introspective thinking that helps

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,360
leaders clarify the big picture

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
and isn't that what we really want to

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
focus on

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
as leaders as the ones who are building

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,240
our communities

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,360
the big picture of where our communities

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,279
can be

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,279
the aspirations of where they can go

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,839
regardless of the size of your community

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
and of course

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
in this context i'm talking about

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
communities as in our teams

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
our business units our departments

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
regardless of

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,680
the size we're still leaders and we

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,279
still have to act like leaders and think

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,600
like leaders

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,040
doing this introspective work allows us

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,519
to think about

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,639
fairness and equality and how we treat

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
those in our communities

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,920
whether we're supervising two people or

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
the managing director of

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
200 people we have to understand what

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,399
we're doing well

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,839
where we are really showing up for that

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
equality and treatment and

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,279
equitable treatment and where we're

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,639
challenged where we

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,839
need help now how can we do this

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,680
we can do this one way to do this is by

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,040
asking our colleagues

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
asking our leaders our executives even

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,120
asking

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,240
our direct approach direct

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,360
reports how are we showing up how are we

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,639
approaching this

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,120
for example we can ask send a survey

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
of examples of when we made other

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,920
members of the community feel

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,279
valuable when we were willing to share

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,199
our roles share our power in terms of

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,399
our roles as leaders

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,120
when did we show up and treat

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,760
something equitably or make a decision

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,639
that

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,560
showed that we were focused on fairness

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,720
now conversely we can also

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,480
ask our colleagues and direct reports

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,120
and leaders

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,040
where are we challenged where have we

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
made decisions that just didn't seem

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,839
fair

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,160
when did we treat members of our

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,079
communities

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
in a way that was not equitable or in a

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,920
way that maybe led them to believe that

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,440
they weren't valuable

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,160
this introspective work no it's not easy

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,600
hearing feedback that shows that there

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,839
may have been times when we weren't

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,279
entirely fair of course that's not easy

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,079
to hear

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,040
but this is the work we have to do to

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,680
create

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,399
our inclusive communities introspection

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,600
that's number one the first step

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,920
the second step is collaborating

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
on our goals that's the second step in

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
reaching an inclusive

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,480
community after introspection we have to

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
focus

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,800
on achieving our goals to really build a

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
community and the first step here is to

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,880
constantly review

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
what you want to achieve for example

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,720
what are your goals

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,920
is your goal to build a community that

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,519
ensures that

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,680
pay parity is there for everyone who

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,800
does the same job

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,759
or is your goal to retain

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,920
an increased number of people of color

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,959
in your business community

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,399
r is your goal to start a membership

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,920
a mentorship or a sponsorship program

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,000
and i just want to pause there for one

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,160
moment because i know in some cases

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
some of us are confused or just don't

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
quite understand the difference between

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,480
mentorship

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
and sponsorship and in order to have a

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
successful community it's really

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,360
important to

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
know the differences in the nuances so

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,519
with

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,399
mentorship mentors provide their mentees

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,800
with guidance and day-to-day advice

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,360
about

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,279
reaching goals or reaching ambitions

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
there's someone that you can talk to

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,199
that you can confide in and they're

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,600
considered an advisor

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,120
sponsors on the other hand now they take

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
a more active role

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,079
in advancing the professional careers of

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,240
those that they sponsor so the sponsors

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
and the sponsees who they support the

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
sponsors are generally

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,160
senior level people perhaps at the same

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,720
firm as the sponsee

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,639
and they use their networks and their

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,959
professional connections to

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,319
advance the sponsy through helping them

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,919
get access to

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,520
high visibility roles to big projects

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,480
as well as helping them secure

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,559
promotions and secure new jobs

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,319
so just wanted to give that difference

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,160
between sponsors

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,679
and mentors but let's get back to our

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,760
point about goals

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,720
so clarifying the goals and really

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,919
understanding

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,840
what does success look like to you

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,600
how will you know when your objective

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,000
has been achieved

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,799
one way to do this is to bring in your

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
colleagues

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,000
bring in other senior leaders share your

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,240
goals with them

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,919
get their feedback on the goals remember

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
we're talking about inclusivity and the

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,640
way to be inclusive

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,240
is to ensure that you get others

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
feedback so get their feedback on the

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
goals

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,840
and you know what being open to tweaking

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
those goals based on the feedback of

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
others

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,360
that is a sure sign of inclusivity and

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,960
it's definitely a way to really

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,000
get those goals accomplished

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,240
it takes a community success is not a

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,080
solo sport and that's why it's important

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
to have an inclusive one an inclusive

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,720
community that is

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
our third step in building an inclusive

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,720
community is

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
moving with deliberate action i like to

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,240
say swift action too

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,400
and here i want to talk about the

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,200
re-learning

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,799
process and the deliberate action that

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,919
comes with relearning

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,200
specifically relearning and replacing

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,679
divisive behaviors

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,720
now there are some biases and conduct

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
that some of us

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,280
have seen in the workplace that we want

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,480
to root out

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,120
that we need to root out to have an

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,360
inclusive environment

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,600
in the past some of us maybe have even

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,400
participated in behavior that did not

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
belong

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,000
in the workplace now this behavior

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,360
might include using inappropriate

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,679
language when speaking

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,840
about colleagues or speaking to

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,640
colleagues

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,039
unfair performance assessments that

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
don't

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,280
reflect an employee's work but rather

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,480
reflect

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,360
their physical appearance for instance

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,400
it could also be knowingly paying an

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,679
employee

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,960
less money than someone else

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,320
even though they do the exact same

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,840
job these behaviors

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:40,080
are divisive these behaviors promote

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,960
exclusion in communities

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,240
these behaviors are big risks to the

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,799
sustainability of

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,280
our businesses and our profitability

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,960
in this step with deliberate action

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
we've got to commit

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
to removing this behavior from our

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,400
communities from our culture

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,039
this is where we can commit to holding

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
people

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,280
accountable when they persist in

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
behaviors

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,840
or conduct or language that doesn't

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,159
promote inclusive community

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,760
this is where we commit to deliberate

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,880
action

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,240
so holding folks accountable means

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,520
really to outline what is acceptable

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
behavior based on your introspective

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
work

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,919
based on your collaborative work with

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,400
colleagues direct reports

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,039
and employees coming to an understanding

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
of what

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,919
inclusive behavior looks like and also

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,880
understanding what it doesn't look like

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,120
sharing that across the community

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,159
enforcing it and really ensuring

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,559
that people who do not

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,679
have the same level of focus on these

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,000
inclusive behaviors

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,799
and people who continue and persist in

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,600
those exclusive and divisive behaviors

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,480
holding them accountable that's what

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,880
moving with deliberate action means

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,880
one additional point here if you are

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,120
unsure about

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,400
what actions or behaviors are

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,120
inappropriate

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,280
what actions or behaviors are divisive

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,679
are exclusive

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,559
what actions and behaviors don't belong

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,559
in your community

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,200
if you have any doubt about that

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,760
look to from the perspective of the

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,840
person

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,120
who is the recipient of the behavior

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,799
of the language of the divisiveness

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,799
look from their perspective

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,960
let that be your guide determining

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,000
whether the person who's received this

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,960
behavior

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,799
considers it inappropriate let that be

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,000
your guide as to what

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,840
behavior belongs in communities again

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,120
getting the feedback of people in your

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
community who

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,280
may not have the high representation

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,880
level is crucial

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,400
let that guide you and

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,240
our last key factor

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
in building an inclusive digital

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,159
community is

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
measuring progress we've all heard the

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,280
saying

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
what doesn't get measured doesn't get

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,280
done right

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,440
or doesn't get managed if for instance

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,600
measuring your progress and course

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,840
correcting if you miss the mark

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,720
this is the only way to ensure that

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,039
we're building

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
inclusive communities inclusive

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,480
communities that

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,440
can grow and that can really prosper and

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,600
become profitable even more profitable

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,000
measurement tools can be as simple as a

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,880
survey where on the scale of one to five

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,600
employees can answer questions like has

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,360
your firm

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,320
improved on offensive gendered language

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,640
are do you see subtle discriminatory

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,600
behaviors toward people of color

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,320
are do you see instances where women

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,400
might be

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,400
second guessed more than men

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,240
another option is to give your community

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,559
members

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,720
your employees at your organization the

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,960
opportunity to answer these questions in

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
a

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,240
long form file this really allows them

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,080
to give

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,080
examples of what the issue was of

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,760
when they experienced the issue and how

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,159
it made them feel

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,760
if we want to be inclusive we need to

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,200
understand the importance

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,679
of the person who experienced this

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
how that make them feel including those

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,480
sorts of things on the survey whether it

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,799
be a short

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,600
one to five ranking or whether it be a

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,679
long form

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,640
we really need to understand where we

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,720
stand there

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,120
now measurement can also take the form

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,360
of outlining the percentage of

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,960
say women senior leaders that you want

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,520
to have in your organization

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,159
over the next 12 months 18 months five

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,039
years

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,799
doing that as well for people of color

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,480
we can also talk to firms who've

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,720
accomplished these goals

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
there are loads of firms who speak about

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,200
how they were able to

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,640
accomplish a certain number of women in

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,000
the executive roles are

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,159
numbers of people of color in the

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,320
executive roles really getting insight

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,360
from the folks who've accomplished it

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,200
and letting them support you in building

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,440
the goals and really understanding what

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,400
success looks like and understanding how

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,120
they measure the goals is another way to

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,159
get to this

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,360
inclusive digital community

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,440
also there are vendors who can support

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,720
this type of management there have been

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,520
these types of measurements

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
there are vendors who create

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
environmental

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
social and governance ratings of

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,039
companies

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,440
they also build out diversity equity and

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,880
inclusion ratings so these vendors can

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,440
really help you understand

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,480
where your firm is now and obviously

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,559
that can help you

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,400
build onto a plan for where you need to

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,480
be and also you can look at

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679
competitors in your space and see where

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,520
they are

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,799
see where other firms outside of your

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,000
industry are

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,799
get an understanding of what makes a
