hi everyone

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,320
uh so thanks for joining us today as

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,639
part of this open source as a services

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
vendor presentation and my name is chris

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,520
howard

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,439
and i'm the open source lead at epam

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,320
systems so a little introduction to

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
myself

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
i've been consulting for 10 years mainly

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
on digital transformation

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
and i'm leading at the moment on all of

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,880
upam's open source activities so that

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,880
includes our open source consulting

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
our osci which is our open source

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
contributors index tool

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,480
and continually helping to push out

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,120
solutions to the world

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,640
for collaboration and development for

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,960
those of you new to epam

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
well we were founded in 1993 and have a

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
very strong

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,920
software engineering heritage but most

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,600
recently this has been combined with our

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
strategic business and innovation

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
consulting

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
and as clients engage with strategy and

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
delivery organizations separately

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
we're in a unique position i'm very

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,199
pleased to be in swan where we can do

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
both

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
and this really allows us to provide

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,520
real business value to our customers

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,119
so let's get started so the first thing

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
we're going to be considering is

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,119
what does open source mean to us here at

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,840
epam

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
well as you can see on the slide there

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
epan systems believes

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
in the principles and power of the free

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
and open source software paradigm

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
well you could say that sounds like

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,479
we've got it perfectly understood

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
but it really wasn't that simple to

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
start with so

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
as a services vendor we we really found

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
ourselves in a position where we had to

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
write our own book

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
on this as our engagement with open

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,040
sources is quite different to many other

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,479
types of organizations

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
in particular perhaps like some of the

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
organizations that many of you here

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
today might be familiar with

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,960
technology providers banking and

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
financial institutions

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,960
so in 2011 12 we started our journey

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
down the open source path

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,799
and we really had to think about how we

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
could embrace and contribute to open

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
source

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,119
as a services company in a worthwhile

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,640
way

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,719
we had to work out what that meant for

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
us whilst at the same time making sure

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,479
that it aligned with our activities

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
our core business and ensured that we

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,599
played as is very important

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
an active part in the open source

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,160
community so

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
fast forward eight years and with pretty

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,959
good grasp we like to think of how we do

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
open source and how we focus our efforts

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,800
across the different faces of open

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
source

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,280
in our organization and we split our

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,440
open source engagement into three clear

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
channels of activity at epam

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,760
and i don't use the term silos here

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
because i do genuinely believe and we

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
should see that later

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
these areas overlap and support one

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
another but like i say more of that

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,879
later

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,160
so our first channel is our client

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
project

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
and this encompasses our engineering and

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,959
delivery work

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400
in the open source space that we do in

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
collaboration with clients as part of

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
their own project engagements

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
it's quite self-explanatory and we'll

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,720
touch on a bit more detail around this

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,800
shortly

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,879
but it really is about helping helping

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,040
our clients with their project work and

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,959
their own open source journeys

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
the second area is our open source

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,599
projects

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
and these are open source projects that

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,239
are drawn out of innovation

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,640
and our client team needs within epam

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,440
where we then recognize the value of

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
this solution

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
and thought that it might be worthwhile

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
to consider or contribute back to the

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
wider community

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
so in this instance we've moved our

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,720
internal ip

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,159
our epam ip to open source through our

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,599
own release process and i'm going to

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
talk a little bit more around our open

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,680
source release process

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,280
in due time and for me i really find

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
these open source projects the most

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
rewarding

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
because it's really great to see the the

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,319
energy and the eagerness from colleagues

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200
around the idea of open source open

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,879
sourcing something that they've built

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,239
and then that continued sense of

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
attachment that they'll then have to

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
that solution

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,519
and it really motivates me to have them

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280
to see them deliver great quality code

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
and support their contributions

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
moving forward on the back of that sense

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
of achievement

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
and attachment that they have but of

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,840
course it's great to have them

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
personally respond be responsible for a

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
solution

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,799
that's now being used by others outside

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,319
of epam or original team and that's

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
really rewarding

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,599
and of course some of you may be

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
thinking well as a commercial

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,199
organization there's a possibility that

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,519
this outward contribution might well

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
lead to generating a revenue stream

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,759
and that's true and i will mention that

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,639
but that's not the primary goal of this

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
open source project channel that we have

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
and our third channel is the supported

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
projects channel

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
and this is where we engage with

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,240
industry and community projects that we

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,600
contribute to

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
so for example apache big data or drupal

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
the automotive linux space that we're

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
working at the moment

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
as well of course our collaboration and

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,880
ongoing commitment to industry

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,840
consortium like

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
finos who we're engaged with here today

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
and these supportive projects are

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
typically where we've got engineers

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,880
consultants and analysts with expertise

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,000
in technologies and the associated

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
languages

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
contributing to products and projects

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,440
that are sitting within the industry

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,639
vertical or a community for that

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120
specific language

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,639
that they're most focused upon and we've

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
established competency centers here

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,840
within epam that focus

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
exactly on that be that our drupal and

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,639
our apache competency centers or our

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
life science

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,680
financial services and insurance

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
verticals

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
so for us being an active contributor

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
and explicitly supporting these

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,440
community initiatives strengthens

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,080
our expertise internally but also allows

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
us to

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,160
support our clients better it's a

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,240
win-win but what do these three groups

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
therefore look like in practice

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,440
well in the first instance our

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
engagement with clients well as a

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
services vendor

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,759
this is the most obvious in terms of

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,280
what we're offering to support our

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,240
clients in their own success

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
and we do this in two ways one the

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,600
delivery angle

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,520
so our engineering and development the

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,880
key to success here and being true to

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
the topic of this talk as a service

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
vendor

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
is to ensure that we're supporting

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,280
clients in the delivery of their own

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,880
open source solutions be that home-grown

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
solutions within their own development

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,759
teams

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,960
or solutions taken from the community

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
and here it's about ensuring that

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,440
individuals we put to work with these

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
clients

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,600
are skilled knowledgeable passionate and

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
really understand the solutions that

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,039
they're engaged with

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
and we ensure that these people as a

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,400
vendor demonstrate a real interest and

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,000
commitment to the development of

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
furthering of not just the clients

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
project and work

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
but the open source solution they're

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,440
engaged with this opportunity for us and

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
for our colleagues to influence and

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,759
direct open source projects

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
and further drive the success within a

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,440
service business

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,039
as a key contributor is key to this part

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,280
of client projects

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,039
but the second and the more exciting

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,960
particularly given my own experience

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,120
is is the consultancy the advice and

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
support and the second way is how we

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,919
engage with our client projects

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
through supporting our clients whether

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,440
open source adoption growth and maturity

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,800
it's not common to find service vendors

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,479
that have such a strong commitment to

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
open source coupled with engineering

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,520
excellence

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
so we're really proud of this and for

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
other service vendors perhaps listening

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
today

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,599
it's a unique position you're in to

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,400
support clients if you've got such a

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,000
strong grasp of open source already too

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,680
so for us this engagement is about

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,960
helping our clients understand open

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
source practices

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
overcoming hurdles misconceptions and

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,319
generally supporting them in selecting

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,680
the right infrastructure and technical

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
decisions

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
so we work with clients who are right at

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
the beginning of their journey

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
considering how they might do that first

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,880
foray or step into consuming open source

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,479
all the way through to clients who are

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,639
using open source but perhaps keep

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,599
hearing governance roadblocks or legal

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
complications around

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,720
ip rights or a lack of ongoing support

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,319
and of course we make recommendations on

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
what kind of solutions to engage with

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,880
within the community where there might

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,560
be an opportunity

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,080
perhaps even for our clients to open

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
source some of their own ip

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
borrowing ideas from our our second

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
channel which of course brings me on to

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,240
that

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
open source project so our second

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
channel

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
well these are solutions innovations and

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
products that have been driven out of

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
both client and internal work that we

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,919
at epam here as an organization believe

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
will be valuable to the wider community

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,599
so for us as a service vendor the

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,199
opportunity for us to expand our

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,160
audience for these epam

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,160
born solutions if you like moving from a

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,080
crate and consume mindset

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
to a create and contribute way of

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,800
thinking is a really great way

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,199
for our developers and engineers to

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
value and be valued about the work that

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
they're engaged with

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
and the number of epam born and led

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
projects that we're pushing through to

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
open source is growing more and more

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
rapidly

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
and i know you can see some key facts

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
there on the screen but we've well

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
over 70 already in the world being used

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,680
on a daily basis and we're continually

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,919
developing and improving

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,560
by epam zone engineers and more

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,399
importantly external contributors

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,160
so i thought i might share some

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
information now around one of these epam

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,440
born solutions a little bit more about

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
its story

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
so you can hopefully now see the the

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,120
epam report portal or the report portal

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
that's now out there in the world

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
and this is exactly the kind of tool

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
that we developed and through using

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
internally saw the benefits that this

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,920
could provide to the wider community

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
we started to work on this tool in 2012

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
and successfully used this for four

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
years for our own

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,200
benefit and some of its features and i

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,040
say incredible features can be

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,519
seen there on the slide such as

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,600
decreasing test effort by 90

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,800
and integrating with a broad array of

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
frameworks

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,720
but in 2016 we felt as part of our

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,360
ongoing commitment to

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
open source and indeed being a good open

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
source citizen

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,839
that it would make sense to release this

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
to the wider community

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
and it was the right decision since then

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,040
it's been deployed by 60 plus

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,080
epam clients and has its own dedicated

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,279
team of 25 people here at upan

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
so you might say well that's very

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,200
exciting but it's still within epam

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,640
but what's even more exciting is that it

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
has a total of 59

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,959
unique contributors both those who've

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,640
never even engaged with epam

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,640
and those who perhaps were in epower and

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,880
now moved on to other things

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,279
so with over a thousand commits alone on

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,360
github we're super proud to have pushed

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,680
this tool up to the community

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
and really seen it blossom and we hope

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,480
that our ongoing commitment to the tool

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
itself

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,120
shows that we are really engaged and who

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,600
knows how many more of our solutions

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
might have equal success this really

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
reinforces

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
our second channel around open source

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
projects and the value they bring both

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
internally

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
but also externally to the wider

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,839
community

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
so what about that final channel well

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
our supported projects

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
well as i mentioned at the beginning

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
these are the projects consortium

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,399
communities and initiatives that you

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
actively is a member of and contributes

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
to as a good open source

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,920
citizen and we're here today as i

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
mentioned as members of finos

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
which i'm sure most of you are familiar

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
with is the fintech open source

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
foundation where we recently

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
transitioned our glue projects

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,959
and soon to be our time-based project

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,959
into their own finos landscape

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,360
so if you think back to the the overlaps

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,399
and synergies that i spoke about before

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
this is a perfect example glue an epam

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
open source project that we believe with

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,040
the support of finnos

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
and their engaged contributors and

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,720
members would be valuable to the

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,120
community and financial industry

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
to sit within their landscape well on

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,000
that notion

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,079
we moved it from sitting within epam's

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
open source space our second channel if

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,800
you like

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
to now residing as a key offering within

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
finus

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
our engineers continue to support and

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,760
contribute it but the focus now

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,519
is much more on organizations and

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,079
contributors to really push forward its

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,279
development

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,120
and usage across the fs sector it wasn't

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,720
selfish for us to keep this

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,320
because we knew that by pushing it out

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,920
to be a supported project

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,920
we were furthering the industry and

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,320
driving innovation

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
but you might say well why particularly

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
as a service vendor

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,920
well as a service vendor it just makes

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
business sense for us to embed our

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,880
employees

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
in established range of communities and

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
groups because if we can maintain our

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,279
own awareness

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
about what is happening in these

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,200
communities and frameworks then we can

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,399
absolutely stay abreast of changes

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,320
and latest innovation but secondly

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,079
to do more than simply build solutions

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,079
around these frameworks and tools

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,800
but to actively participate in their

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,240
development so take drupal for example

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
if we can be responsible and

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
co-responsible for developing

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
the backlog definition bug fixes and

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,639
being a truly active member of this

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
community

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,279
then we'll receive so much more value

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,200
than simply building a tool on top of it

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,040
and it's that final engagement of the

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
three channels that are highlighted

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,720
that wraps up our kind of relationship

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
with open source externally

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,440
so from client to create and contribute

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,200
and then finally to community

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,200
so we've heard a lot about our external

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
engagement but how do we encourage open

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,959
source contribution

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,720
within epam and how do we drive ongoing

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,200
contribution from our employees to

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
open source solutions well the next few

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,399
slides should give an overview

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
some of the ways in which we here at

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
epam a service company

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,120
really do drive open source within our

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
organization

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
so the most important thing we've

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,399
realized

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,639
is that employees either engineers

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,680
analysts account managers pre-sales or

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,839
leadership

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,360
need to be able to find the home of open

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,120
source with an epap

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
and that's represented by open source

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,639
there sitting within the middle of what

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,720
you can see on the screen

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,839
the idea of an organization doing or

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,440
living open source

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,880
is great but there still needs to be

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,639
someone owning this

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
and a team supporting its development

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,320
and growth

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,279
so we created a dedicated space within

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
the organization

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,360
our open source project office if you

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,519
like although a little less defined

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
that provides everyone with a simple

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,560
easy to find

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
point of reference for their open source

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,040
activities and engagement

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,800
and we sit across the organization we're

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
not tied to a specific function

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,560
so we're accessible to all and we're

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
also not related specifically to a team

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,480
or a specific project or deliverable

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,800
we're always available and always

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
accessible so on the left hand side of

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,279
the screen

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
you can see the kind of activities that

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
my team i get up to in terms of

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
provision or providing

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,959
so promoting working on open source

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,160
solutions freely and removing barriers

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,839
to doing so

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
or perhaps developing a culture of

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,959
innovation and a strong internal

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
community around open source

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,800
something i'm particularly passionate

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
about or finally rewarding individual

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,079
open source contributions celebrating

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,360
successes which i'm going to come on too

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,800
shortly

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
but on the right hand side you can see

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,959
more of the support role that we exist

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,720
to provide and that's the more kind of

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,480
meaty items around reducing

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,000
legal complications through clear

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,720
guidance on what is an

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,560
is an epam ip perhaps or perhaps when

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
colleagues might want to notify us that

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
they're

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,240
engaged on something which i'm quite

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
proud to say is quite few occurrences

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,079
now given the the kind of stream working

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,519
and narrowing down of this process we've

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,240
established

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
or perhaps it's supporting on educating

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,519
the sales and account managers on the

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,040
value of open source which i'm sure here

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,040
today we're all aware of

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,399
but making this an active part of client

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,160
conversations

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,639
or indeed it could be actually working

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
with the delivery and project teams to

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,639
support them on solutions to

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,360
establishing suitable ways of working

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,519
given their clients open source demands

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
or even perhaps uh recommending

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
potential open source solutions over

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,680
paid software

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,800
or even engineering a bespoke solution

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,399
itself now we know we don't have it

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
perfect and please don't think that we

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
do

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,480
but there's lots more we'd love to be

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,040
able to do and provide to our colleagues

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,800
and the diagram above purely shows us at

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
our high level the kind of remit that

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,639
our open source team

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
has within epam we're constantly

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,959
improving

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,639
and we're always taking ideas from the

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,079
community and indeed some of the

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,600
speakers at this conference

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,519
around what provision and support

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,759
offerings we can provide to to our

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,680
community to continue growing

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,680
and as part of giving our teams all that

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,920
they need and of course being a good

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,600
open source citizen we also encourage

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,240
our teams to contribute back to

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
to us and to our community so the next

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
slide

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,240
as i mentioned earlier our release

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
process visualizes

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,160
some of the solutions uh some of the

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
stages sorry that our solutions have

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,720
flown through

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,320
as part of that open source release

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
process

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
so this is our open source release

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,360
process here at epam

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
i'll be it with a few less words to

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,279
enable me to share it with you today

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
but what's important about this is that

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,240
this process is visible

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,560
and accessible to anyone in the

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
organization and it's as stripped back

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,920
and succinct as possible

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,839
and it's been through i can assure you

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
many iterations where we've managed to

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,160
cut out various stages

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,519
red tape approvals sign-offs etc and

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,440
really bring it down to the key

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,320
activities and stakeholders

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,240
so as the open source capability we're

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,279
always behind as hopefully my last slide

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,279
indicated

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,959
our teams through supporting them with

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
questions where necessary

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,079
because it's really important for us to

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
not stifle innovation

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,600
so we make sure that this release

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,120
process is as simple and as

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,720
straightforward as possible

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,360
and you can see along the top the four

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,360
stages so we start with one inception

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
moving through preparation release and

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
promotion

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
and within each of these four stages we

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,000
have typical activities

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,040
be that notifying us about the project

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
through to perhaps

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
doing security scans setting up repos on

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
github

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,679
and then even shouting about it and

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
promoting the solution

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,839
and we typically see projects go through

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,199
this process in about a month

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,520
so from the point at which they present

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,679
that idea to us all the way through to

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,480
us handing over that repo to them

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
we're talking about three or four weeks

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,959
and of course

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,959
as i mentioned in the true spirit of

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,120
collaborative working we take on all

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,559
feedback and indeed in our release stage

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,319
we have a stage where they can actually

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,559
feedback on how the open source team

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,799
have done as part of this process

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,480
and we know that this process works and

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,520
as a services vendor that's super

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,440
important

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
because we've built this process and i

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,600
can assure you that when my inbox

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,480
receives a notification around a new

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,919
project

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,679
i've already seen that people have

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
perhaps jumped to stage two and done the

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,919
various scans already

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,760
and in my opinion that's fantastic as a

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
services vendor our employees

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,919
are our primary measure of success so

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
it's really important that we make these

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,400
processes as easy as possible

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,919
and those inbox notifications are

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
testament to that

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,520
but it's also important that we value

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
our employees and we ensure that we

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,320
celebrate

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,160
their successes and their innovations

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,200
and indeed their contributions

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,559
so how do we do that well here you can

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
see some of the initiatives we have

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,160
within epam to reward contributions to

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
open source but also encourage

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
further innovation so at the top left

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,200
and i'll take a little time just

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,320
explaining each of these

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
we can see badges so we use our indexing

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
where we're able to see a daily record

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
of those contributing to open source

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,080
projects

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
and i'll talk about our indexing when we

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,919
come down to the osci index

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,080
but it provides us with an opportunity

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,080
for each month to award contribution

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,240
for a single commit all the way up to

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,480
those people doing hundreds of commits

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
and these badges fit in with our larger

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,080
corporate badging system

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,679
so through gamification we're

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
encouraging more engagement in open

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
source

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,440
because individuals and employees want

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
to receive more badges

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
to have a better reputation at a

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
corporate level the motivation here is

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
about looking good

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,760
within the company but at the same time

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,760
looking great within the open source

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,360
community

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,120
our second area around what we do as a

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
services vendor and one that's probably

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,320
the most weighty

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,679
is our executive recognition our

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,360
leadership really are

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,880
on board of us in recognizing the

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,559
importance of open source

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,000
and off the back of this when we tell

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,559
them good news perhaps that one

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
individual

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,600
has done something in the financial

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
services community

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,520
or there's a leader in the drupal

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,200
competency our executive recognition

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,120
happens where they jump on board send

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
them an email a notification award them

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,760
in some way

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
to say thank you for being on board with

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,320
us as part of this

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,400
and the third one is our epan garage and

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
it's not based about cars but i'm sure

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
many of you have incubators innovation

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,120
spaces garages whatever you choose to

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
call them

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,280
so through linking up with the epam

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,120
garage we present a unique opportunity

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,360
to open source the innovation and the

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,840
solutions happening in that space

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,000
the garage in epam is able to rapidly

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,440
solve problems and iterate these

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
with some of these solutions then

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
entering that release process we just

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
spoke about

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,840
it gives us a unique opportunity to see

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
what's going on within the innovation

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
and the innovative areas of the business

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,799
to then present an opportunity to

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,640
perhaps start pushing those out to the

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,400
wider community

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
now the osci index some of you might be

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,080
familiar with but this is an epam tool

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
that was rolled out last year

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,320
and provides a ranking of the top

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
contributors by organization

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
in the open source space driven by

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
github contributions

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,440
and you can find that online but this

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,120
tool really drives innovation

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,240
because it encourages our employees and

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,240
our individuals to contribute to epam

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
epam's ranking through wanting to

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
increase our own ranking through their

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,400
efforts

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,400
and indeed we've seen other individuals

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,960
and other organizations engaging with us

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
to say

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,640
how can we bring this culture to our own

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
organization particularly in the

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,360
services space

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
to encourage our employees to really

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
help us show that we're walking the walk

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
and not just talking it

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,559
and our final thing around uh this

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,520
ranking and

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,280
contribution here is productization so

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,559
as a team we're always keeping our eyes

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,320
and as the open source team

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,240
always keeping our eyes out and our

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,799
finger on the pulse of what the delivery

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,799
project

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,960
client teams are doing within epam and

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,960
we're recognizing the opportunity

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
proactively to support teams of open

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,440
source and highlight the value in doing

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,280
so if they choose to pursue it

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,520
all of these approaches all five i just

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,280
went through really help us develop

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,000
recognize and celebrate open source

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,640
contribution within the organization

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
so as we come towards a closing point to

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,360
sum things up

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,200
hopefully i've set the scene that

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
amongst some of the very largest service

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,720
providers there are

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,320
a few that are prominent contributors to

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,080
open source

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,600
but there are others that have embraced

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,440
open source and been on a similar

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
journey to us in understanding how to

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,840
thread it

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,600
throughout their business and we'd

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,799
really love to see more and more of the

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
service providers

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,000
jumping on board and being identified as

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,840
real top contributors in these spaces

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,240
but if we go back to thinking about open

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,440
source as a services vendor and consider

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,919
those three channels

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,440
that we mentioned at the beginning it is

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,120
clear that the primary focus of the

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
services company remains the delivery

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,720
client work

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,000
that's why we're all doing the job we do

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,760
but the through operating

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
that through offering open source

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,600
solutions created both

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
internally through sourcing open source

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,400
alternatives

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,080
through supporting community development

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,039
and through providing consulting as we

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,960
mentioned earlier

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,679
on perhaps open source adoption and

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,200
growth these unique avenues that service

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
companies possess

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,679
when compared to other organizations

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,120
provide us all with a great opportunity

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,960
to embrace open source with open arts

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,720
this notion of building a culture of

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,080
open source within an organization

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
through some of the methods i've just

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
shared but indeed some of your own as

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,400
well

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,840
and continually pushing your business

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
and your employees

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,679
to support the community and those

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,159
industry projects too

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,960
are avenues available to service vendors

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,200
who want to join the open source journey

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,440
and in the last few minutes i really

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,039
wanted to give you two recommendations

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,240
that we've learned because i think it's

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,840
always important to have some key

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,559
takeaways

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,480
well there's two of them the first

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,320
formalizing open source

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,640
so a few years ago i mentioned we

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,600
started our journey in 2012 but a few

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,600
years ago

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,280
we had a a number of individuals in the

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,360
organization who were responsible for

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,039
the open source office or team

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,440
and unfortunately they moved on to other

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,919
exciting things or left to focus on

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,360
other another areas of focus

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
what happened was things like our

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,240
knowledge base that central point in the

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,799
organization

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,480
everything around it kind of disappeared

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,039
that lack of control that we possessed

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,360
over open source as just an idea

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,280
meant that actually that whole culture

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,120
left the organization too

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,799
so the lesson we learned here is that we

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,400
absolutely need to formalize

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,799
open source and that's why we set up

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,240
that kind of core offering that umbrella

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,760
across the organization

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,520
and i'd encourage you all who perhaps

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,200
are in a similar situation thinking

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
that open sourcing your organization is

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,080
an idea at the moment or a culture

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,679
to formalize that and the second is

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,960
inclusion is key and this is a really

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,760
recent lesson we learned

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,520
but a fantastic one is that we've been

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,039
recognizing and celebrating all of these

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,039
employees perhaps through some of those

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,320
methods i just mentioned

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,760
but actually what we weren't very good

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
at doing is recognizing the people who

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
were under the radar

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,000
the people who were doing incredible

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
things in open source the people who

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
were

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,760
innovating and pushing out to the

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039
community perhaps even contributing in

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,880
their own time

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,559
but we just weren't visible for them but

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,840
they weren't visible for us sorry we

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,120
didn't know who they were we didn't have

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
a channel to find that out

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,840
and we're doing more and more at the

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,520
moment to look at our data sources and

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,039
the ways in which we find these people

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
or indeed encourage them to tell us

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
themselves through perhaps making open

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
source

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,200
far more ingrained in our day-to-day so

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,120
the lesson we learned here was

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,480
literally reach out to be as inclusive

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,480
as possible and

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
avoid any rewards or recognition that

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,640
are perceived as

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,080
unmotivational so perhaps those could be

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
we're awarding one particular data

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,480
source but if you happen to be

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
contributing another

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,080
then perhaps you're off our radar so for

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,840
us that's a real action point moving

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,760
forward

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
so it has been an absolute real pleasure

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
to be able to share these insights with

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
you today

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,360
and i do hope that you've heard a few

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,039
useful actions or initiatives to take

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
back to your respective organizations

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,320
and in particular those of you too from

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
service vendors

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
in particular it will be great to see a

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
few more service companies really

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,200
picking up that challenge

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,559
that i've thrown down to join us in the

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
open source world

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,600
i want to thank you very much for

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,360
listening and i do wish you a fantastic

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:29,840
remainder of the conference

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,840
thank you

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
