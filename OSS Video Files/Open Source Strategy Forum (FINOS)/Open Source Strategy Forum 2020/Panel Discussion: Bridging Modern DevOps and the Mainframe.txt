talking about

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,240
how we got here the linux foundation's

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,960
open mainframe project turned five years

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,880
old

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,400
uh this month or not this month i'm

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,720
sorry this year

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
and you know a lot led up to that open

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
source has really been a part of the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
mainframe

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,439
for a long time now um really since the

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
early days of the mainstream back in the

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,960
1950s

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
and the zoe initiative this project

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
launched

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,840
two years ago in 2018. and so we're

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,840
going to talk about today

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,420
[Music]

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
what were some of the challenges and

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,720
opportunities that really led to the

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,840
creation of the open mainframe project

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
uh thank you john well the linux

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
foundation's

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,400
timing of the open mainframe project

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
was excellent it was actually at the

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
time

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,160
uh exactly when ibm

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,959
announced the ibm linux 1 system if you

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
might recall

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
they were up there and it was an event

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,879
in seattle

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,319
and um with the

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,040
new linux only mainframe type system

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,680
plus linux already having quite a

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
footprint

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,640
on uh mainframes in general

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,720
uh the need for helping

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,440
bring more focus on open source

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,319
uh open source projects open source

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
software

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,959
to the platform was just at uh

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,080
just right at the right time you know

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,519
a lot of times people run into barriers

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
of bringing that kind of those kinds of

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,120
solutions

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,239
based in and around open source and

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,599
with the experience

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,400
of the linux foundation helping

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
form this project around the mainframe

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,120
and then

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
also with the zoe initiative which

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,400
started a

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,239
few years later one of the very first

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,360
zos open source projects open

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,959
uh projects um it was uh really needed

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
because it helped bring

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
good uh semblance around the work that

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
needed to be done

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,599
with compliance and

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,599
project management and

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,040
bringing the different organizations

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,040
that wanted to participate and

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,920
contribute to the project

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,799
it was just uh you just couldn't ask for

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,080
a better thing to

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:10,560
have happened and now

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,280
today there are 15

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
established strong open mainframe

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,359
project

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,799
projects say that fast three times right

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,320
john

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,680
and um all in

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,080
different stages uh there's a lot of

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
work

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,759
that's going on a lot of different

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,479
people contributing

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,000
in organizations some are on multiple

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,919
projects

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
and it has also helped with

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,040
the internship program uh bringing some

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,440
of those resources from

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,800
some very bright students working on

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
some of that some of them and

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
actually some of those actually turned

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,520
into

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,000
actual uh projects themselves

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
uh one of these 15 that we just

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
mentioned today

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
so uh that's been kind of my perspective

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,240
and then

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,440
um you know i volunteered the first year

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
and then i didn't realize it was going

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,720
to turn into a career

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
it's been great though i really enjoy it

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
uh i can't believe five

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,440
plus years have gone by already and uh

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,720
i don't see any end in sight the the

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
the open source uh projects and the open

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,440
source coming to the mainframe

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,440
is just uh exponentially growing john

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,320
absolutely absolutely and you've been a

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,400
great asset not only to the project but

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,639
just for the mainframe community

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,840
as a whole um you know jen maybe just

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,520
tell me your thoughts and i know you've

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,639
been involved more in the project here

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
recently

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,320
um you know certainly as zoe has really

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,759
taken off and i know you work with a lot

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
of customers in the field tell me about

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,639
some of

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
what you see now yeah so i think lynn

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039
started to really hit the nail

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,560
on the head so you know the whole life

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,080
cycle of just linux looking at the

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
operating system and then when the linux

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
foundation came

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,160
um about it's always been the community

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,800
involvement community contributions that

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,479
open collaboration when open mainframe

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
started five years ago it actually

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,800
started to break down those barriers

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
that we've always had

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
around z it's always been you know what

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
ibm's done what

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
the other uh vendors have done that have

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
built on top of ibm z and for the first

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,720
time we're saying

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,120
no we really want to foster

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
collaboration and zoe was really this

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,280
like kind of really

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
big effort between all these big z

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,720
shops and i say shops in the way of like

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,759
you know um

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,160
comfy wear and broadcom and ibm

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,520
and rocket and all these companies

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
saying we're actually going to work

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,039
together

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,639
on a project to make something that will

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,400
actually open up how we can interact

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,600
with the traditional site of ibmc with

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,759
zos

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,280
and that's been amazing to see that all

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,120
come through what we've been able to do

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
with it how we've been able to grow it

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
and really how it started all these

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
other projects um that are really

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
addressing what we all see and feel as

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
we work with clients as um

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
you know maybe even as we work on our

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,599
own uh companies

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,080
so now we've got projects like um the

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
open mainframe uh education project

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
where we're working to have collateral

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
available um

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,680
that everybody can use to have a path to

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,880
help people learn how to work with

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,960
um the zos side of the house and

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
and having that be like a joint effort

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
it shouldn't just be one company i mean

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
this is technology well i love why not

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,479
share that passion

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
so it's been really fun to see how

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,360
that's grown and changed and all the

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,479
different projects that have come about

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,319
and really how it's going to change the

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,880
future for the technology that we all

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,880
love to use

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
absolutely absolutely looking always

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
forward to the future it's really a cool

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
thing

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
you know talking to you here i mean

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
copyright

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
we're part of the initial launch and i

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
know you've just been around the

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
mainframe community

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,759
for a long time i mean i think if

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,879
anybody you know talks about people who

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,560
install words in the name

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,560
community you know sam your name is

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
right there all of them

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,759
um and i know you've been able to see

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
this definitely from a broader

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,039
perspective tell me you know a little

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,800
bit about what you've seen as sort of

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,560
the challenges opportunities around open

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
source in the mainframe and how you see

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
you know open mainframe project zoe and

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,759
some of those projects fitting in

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
so you're right this has been really a

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
long

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
time theme on the mainframe which is

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
collaboration

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,960
and cooperation and sharing amongst

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,039
customers

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,479
and you know the share user group is if

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,160
you think about where to the roots of

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,280
some of these things that

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,879
are today you know mature in the the

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,159
open mainframe project

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,479
they go back to and the share user group

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,440
since the very early days of the

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
uh the platform was customers coming

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,039
together

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,440
at first just a handful to support each

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
other

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
directly in ways that were complementary

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,399
or sometimes

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,200
filled in gaps from ibm as a platform

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
provider

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,120
and so things like the share program

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,279
library agency the sla

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
tapes you know back when code was

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,160
exchanged on listings or

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,720
punch cards and eventually round tapes

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,720
uh the evolution to private

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,680
collaboration of customers through

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
things like the

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
cbt tape which is kind of a collection

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
of collections

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,200
uh which was named from the connecticut

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,440
bank and trust

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,040
where one of the chief curators you know

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
ernie casagino

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,920
worked and now sam golub and i continue

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,279
to carry that on and most recently

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,279
really coming into

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,839
the open mainframe project and getting

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,040
support in continuing to foster those

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
efforts so it

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
it is the community that spans more than

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,320
five decades

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,560
and has evolved and so it's just natural

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,720
now that comes into a framework

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
where there's you know more formalized

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,480
support there's some

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,120
ideas that will help it to evolve in

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,200
terms of modern open source practices

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
and governance and all of those things

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,720
are just natural

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
changes over time but but the spirit

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,080
that goes back to the launch of the

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
mainframe

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,720
is unchanged and that is customers want

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,519
to help each other on this platform

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
people

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
want to share knowledge and they want to

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
share

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,480
code that will help other people

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
accomplish the same goals

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,240
they want to help raise the platform up

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
and make it the best experience for

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
everybody

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,720
you know there's there's a column that i

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
read years ago and it talked about

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,519
you know we are all smarter together and

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,440
solving other people's problems

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,800
and there there is tremendous

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
satisfaction in that

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,760
but there's also uh it's a little bit of

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,440
you know ideal self-interest in that

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,200
you help other people solve their

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
problems but you're helping them so you

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,480
see it in community forums

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
sharing code and open source is today's

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,760
incarnation

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
of that effort and i'm sure if you

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,959
looked out ten years in the future 20

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,720
years in the future

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,040
it'll look a little different than today

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,760
but i do think this idea of

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,279
open collaboration is here to stay and

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,360
the open mainframe project

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,839
is is a perfect example of how that's

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,240
working in the mainframe

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,880
community awesome and you know

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,399
and sam i always i think ever to look

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,000
forward you always have to look

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
backwards and you know when we talk

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
about open source we exactly point right

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,560
back to share 1955

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
um and that initial collaboration that

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,920
came together and

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
you know work that came from the cbt

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
tape forming in 1975

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,519
of just bringing all of those you know

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
all of that initial code that you know

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
we would think is code i guess but you

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,760
know it's people exchanging ideas and

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
things and

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,320
bringing it forward um i even learned

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,480
recently that jim zemlin

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
his grandpa was involved in the

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
mainframe and

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
uh he always used to joke with them and

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
say you know

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
every new technology jim would talk to

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
him about he's like well the mainframers

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
did that decades ago and

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
source is one of them for sure um but on

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
top of that he said he actually attended

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
chair

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,800
um as a kid so it's so interesting to

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,000
see all of that just come completely

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,920
full circle

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,760
you actually see generational

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,399
involvement in the community you know

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
where

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,240
you know parents children who are now in

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,800
their 20s

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,839
are entering into similar careers on the

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,000
same platform

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
and that's pretty amazing but you think

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,920
about the contributions

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,160
it's thousands of individuals and and

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
that is a you know an actual number that

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,320
i looked at it's more than a couple of

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,440
thousand people thousands of companies

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,440
so over over the span of time it is

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,600
phenomenal the number of people

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
who've had their hands uplifting the

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
platform together

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,000
absolutely absolutely well let's let's

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
jump forward to the next question here

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
for this group

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,880
and you know lynn touched on it zoe is

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,079
that first open source project that's

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
really based on the z

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,920
os um you know platform itself

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
and you know the concept of white came

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
together

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,240
was to help create that integration

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,200
platform for the next generation of

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
tools

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,279
uh that need to support zus and really

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
help bring together that entire

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,639
uh ecosystem but really bring it

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
together even within the organization

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
and i know jen you're like i said you're

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
really customer facing you're talking

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,519
with developers

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
talking to people you know tell us a

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,279
little bit like how you have seen this

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,079
sort of play out

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,920
um so initially zoe was just like kind

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,360
of like big bombshell kind of news like

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,240
everybody's like what is this what is

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,959
this

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
um and really now it's been like okay

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
what are we gonna do with this how can

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,399
we leverage this how can we

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,519
build on this um pretty much every

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,839
customer i talk to

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,600
every organization i go to everybody's

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,760
looking to standardize their set of

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
tooling that they use particularly for

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,959
devops you know we don't want to have to

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,279
have an ide

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,199
for you know zos and a different ide for

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,600
power and a different ide for our cloud

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,560
systems and a different ide for any like

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
x86 based systems we want to have a set

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
of tooling if you need to switch views

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,720
or something like that okay that's fine

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
but we don't want to have to have our

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,399
developers all the time trying to

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,519
install

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
different bases so zoe's really actually

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
kind of

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,120
kind of struck a chord with the

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,360
audiences because

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,880
it has a plug-in it has a cli we don't

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
have to go to developers say

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
hey i really need you to use this other

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,160
tool

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
to work with this other system over here

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,959
and make it feel weird and different

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
they can use tooling they already have

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,160
like vs code or maybe

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,440
they don't use vs code maybe they like

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,240
using a text editor and they like to use

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
cli's

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,560
they can do that too um but more than

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
that other people can build on top of

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
that because it is an open source

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,199
project so it allows

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,880
all of us to collaborate together to

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,320
actually have what we need

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,480
and what we need to use and so the

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,519
adoption of it's really been

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,880
um amazing everybody's wanting to try it

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,240
everybody's experimenting with it

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,639
everybody's really trying to figure out

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,399
how it works best for their environment

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,839
um and then from that trying to figure

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
out you know could i build an extension

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
on this maybe i need a different plug-in

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,839
you know what do i need to do so it's

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,440
just been amazing to see how everybody's

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
been so excited about this

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
and really trying to drive how they can

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,839
standardize

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,839
and use this across all of their systems

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,160
um yeah absolutely that's a really great

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
insight and it's great to hear that from

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,079
the field

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,240
and and i know len um at viacom infiniti

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,519
uh you all have really used as an

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
opportunity to do some really unique

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,800
things

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,800
in the space um and i know one of um you

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,839
know yearly developers alex kim built a

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
really interesting

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,440
integration um tell us about that and

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
just tell us about

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
um how you're seeing this as you talk

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,600
with customers

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,639
sure john um the

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
project that john just mentioned here at

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,120
vicom infinity is something called

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,759
viva vicom infinity voice

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:47,440
assistant and it is based on zoe

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,199
and all of you i'm sure are familiar

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,199
with

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:56,480
alexa echo and google home

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,360
consumer level types of voice assistants

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,839
that you use

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,160
in and around the house play music to

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,320
order something to

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,720
[Music]

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
do whatever that you do at the consumer

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
level but

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,160
the issue that we started

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,959
when we started thinking about a voice

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,560
assistant to use them

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,120
with at an enterprise system level would

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
have introduced some very serious

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,320
security

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,759
uh issues for enterprise type customers

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,120
so uh alex and his team

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:36,000
set out to develop viva

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,199
and base it on the interfaces within zoe

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,480
and then uh take advantage

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,519
of the technology for security

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:51,839
in the mainframe area known as hyper

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,839
protect services which means that uh

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,320
there's no way to be able to penetrate

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,320
and look at the data listen to other

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,880
people's voice messages that might be

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
being

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
used over this over the viva device or

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,039
anything like

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,160
that to net it out and

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,280
um when we talk to people

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,720
about this they look at it in

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,919
kind of a funny way because they say wow

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,319
that means i don't have to use a

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,039
keyboard anymore well that's true

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,600
the world is starting to go more towards

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,480
voice

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,720
activation for everything we know that

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,039
all started with

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,080
star check and space idc

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,200
uh 2001

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,120
movies right so now

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
being able to talk to the mainframe

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,080
helps

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:49,440
with this device as being so secure

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,559
makes it capable for any kind

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,600
of enterprise level systems people want

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,720
to use it with

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,039
because they don't have to worry about

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,240
security and compliance issues

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,880
and secondly

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,679
um if you're worried about skills with

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
the mainframe

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
well if you can't talk english language

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
i'm afraid

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:15,039
we can't help you viva

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,679
allows you to use english language

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,520
and talk to your system command it and

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,960
management

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:27,360
manage it just with your voice and

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,400
what more can you ask for today

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,000
we are just beginning to roll it out

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,120
and uh get it into uh some

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,760
particular clients to help fine-tune the

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,520
project

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,120
and uh watch this space

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,960
in 2021 which is

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,000
can't get here fast enough for a lot of

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,080
us but it's going to be here soon enough

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,440
so that's a little bit about that story

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
john so let's

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,559
disagree could you ask aviva something

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,160
like

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,440
how is job abc doing

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,760
what you know what's its status or

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,360
what's its output

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,840
yes jen exactly uh what's my process

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,480
utilization

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,200
um how am i doing against my four-hour

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,400
rolling average of my for my software

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,760
costs and the reason

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
why we did this kind of as a starting

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
point

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,720
you know we work a lot with the

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,520
financial services clients in and around

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,919
the streets near our office where you

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
know

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,360
penn plaza near madison square garden so

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,679
you know there's a lot of financial

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,679
services customers in and around

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,720
us and i grew up in a space on wall

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,640
street for

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
when i was still at ibm and still doing

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,240
it here

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,520
and uh you know when the market goes

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,880
crazy everybody gets very concerned

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,200
on their slas am i meeting my slas

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,559
and how many times do they have to

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
interrupt their

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,000
system programmers to do that kind of

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
work when they're busy doing everything

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
else

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
uh trying to keep the system up and

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,120
running and uh

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,799
their day jobs uh afternoon jobs and

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,760
evening jobs right

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,200
so being able to do this uh put

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,280
something like this

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,440
on your phones on on your desk and be

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,840
able to ask those kinds of questions

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
without having to interrupt is this

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,559
going to make a big difference for

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,679
productivity

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,559
uh and safety of accessing that data and

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
and those kinds of pieces of information

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,720
someone

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,240
would be looking for especially during

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
crucial times

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
that's so cool and there's a great video

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,240
um on the open mainframe project youtube

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
of demos of that you should really go

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,840
check that out

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,360
um just kind of stand in action it's

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,440
really fascinating

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,039
um you know say maybe a quick to you

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,120
here you know i know you've been

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,159
like i said around this platform a long

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,080
time computer and bmc are huge leaders

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,840
in the devops space and thinking about

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
how to connect the administration

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,960
management

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,799
of z os systems back to the you know

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
back into the the rest of their

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,600
environment

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
um you know how are you seeing a

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,480
technology like this potentially being

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
able to you know really modernize the

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
mainframe

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,720
so i mean something that compuwer has

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,679
really focused on since 2016

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,280
is evolving the developer experience and

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,360
you know our entire thesis

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
has been that we wanted to mainstream

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,320
the mainframe to make it

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,080
different only in syntax so

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
there isn't anything that's you know

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,400
inherently

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,039
difficult about cobalt syntax versus

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,240
pearl

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,520
or you know rust or go or

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,799
jcl versus ash or tcl

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
so syntax can be learned you know

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
programming is generally kind of a one

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
two three many

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
exercise and what we found is by

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,480
bringing

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,840
modern tools and by bringing open apis

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,559
to this space

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,039
this was an opportunity to really help

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,520
mainframe development change

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,520
to facilitate continuous delivery and

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
that the sort of the order of the day

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
would be

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,080
developer experiences that were modern

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
and that were

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,440
continuous delivery tool chains that

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,159
were enabled

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,039
by open apis you know typically restful

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
apis

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,480
that could plug into modern you know ci

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
tools

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,320
and ultimately to modern deployment

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,400
tools and that's definitely been our

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,360
experience working with early adopters

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
we think that

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,840
that type of approach is now moving to

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,559
an early majority phase

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,760
where more and more customers are

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,240
looking to do this

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,520
and naturally it's going to be

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,840
multi-platform multi-vendor

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,720
as they they knit their own tool chains

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,760
together

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,559
so things like the apa api gateway and

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
zoe

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
you know offer a lot of interesting

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,240
possibility and zoe is definitely at

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,320
that wonderful stage it's like the

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,240
the gangly teenager and you're thinking

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,880
maybe it's going to get its first job

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,799
soon and you know will evolve it has it

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
has a lot of potential so i'm very

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,159
excited as the

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,760
as you know zoe foster some of this

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,720
development you see some

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,280
some key steps forward like the delivery

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,679
of

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,360
you know sort of a gold standard binary

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
and long-term support

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,200
so i think these things are incredibly

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,600
important and in in terms of the

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
long-term maturity definitely it's early

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,039
days for zoe

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,720
and i think in the next couple of years

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
we'll start to see some very interesting

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,520
things

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,480
as customers figure out how does this

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
fit into

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,360
my overall development process and on

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,000
the operational side

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,960
we've got technologies like ansible that

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,559
may become more

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,240
than again very early days and vendors

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
to this you know to this puzzle and it's

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
always going to be a combination of the

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
community

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,720
the platform provider ibm and vendors

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,080
really all bringing

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,840
innovation and you know to the platform

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,520
and applying it to

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,679
running the platform keeping the lights

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,400
on as well as innovating the way that

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,000
these processes are done and vendors

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,400
especially bmc have done an

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,400
outstanding job of taking their their

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
investment in operational excellence and

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
now

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,039
incorporating modern modern user

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,320
interface design

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,679
and ai and machine learning so all of

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,679
this is coming together in a very

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
interesting time for the platform

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,279
i'm really excited to see sort of where

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,159
will zoe be

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,440
a year two five years down the road and

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,520
i think it will be

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,520
one of those things that help all three

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,919
of those groups come together

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,000
to really continue to reinvent the

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,760
platform

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,039
yeah absolutely absolutely i couldn't

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,080
have said it better myself and

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,480
it's it's great you know as computer

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,760
uh and now as a part of bmc has really

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,679
been a leader in that space in the

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,440
mainframe community

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,520
and just understanding how to bring you

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,320
know all of it together because for so

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,840
long

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,520
you know the mainframe part of it had

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,919
been separated from the rest of the

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,600
uh the it infrastructure the it

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
organization and now as that's coming

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,320
together

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,039
that api first um mentality

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,880
is is really a key one which is a great

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,480
segue to what i want to start you right

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,000
off with sam because you talked about

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
apis

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,279
and you talked about api first on the

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,360
mainframe

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,760
what is it like like what are you seeing

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
um interesting happening in that space

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,279
principally that the people who

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,080
do this work when i talk about the

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,480
developer experience evolution

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,720
the the people who are sponsoring it are

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,240
not typically mainframe

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,159
you know long tenured majors these are

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,000
people who drive

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,159
digital transformation enterprise devops

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
and they look at the mainframe as just

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,480
another platform and so they really want

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,279
to drive out some of the esoterica

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,320
around it

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,200
they look for apis that can be leveraged

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
that are

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,679
standard restful apis that are

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,240
documented in swagger for instance

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,240
and things like the apa gateway as a way

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,320
to bring those things together

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,000
are you know again have tremendous

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,000
potential and so that's

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
that's where you really see this is the

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,360
idea of being able to take

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
tools knit them together in you know in

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,120
pipelines to build automation

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,640
in ways that is absolutely compatible

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,360
with what's already being done on other

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,600
platforms is complementary

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,440
to the the automation and investments

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,000
that are unique to the z os

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,960
platform and those will always exist you

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,600
know i i would

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
if you want to talk about macro trends

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,120
things like ansible

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,799
never completely supplement the

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,760
automation that's built on

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,159
platform you know the on platform

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,159
management engines and monitors

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,480
what's happening is those monitors for

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,760
instance if you think of sort of classic

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,159
tools are being monetized you know bmc

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,799
talks about this in terms of amy

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,039
bringing

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,080
you a modern set of tenants and

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,080
technology attributes

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,240
to tools that have often existed for a

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
long time and again kind of reinventing

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,520
them

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,799
in this modern context so that's where i

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,440
see customers going

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,000
is looking at their existing investment

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,799
and their applications on the mainframe

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,320
working code working code is gold so you

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,760
don't want to throw that away you know

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
you can't go

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,840
by the application that you have evolved

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,760
over 40 years

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,960
to meet compliance needs and line of

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
business needs

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,000
because those applications don't exist

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,559
in

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
a catalog of packaged applications you

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,840
could buy on the cloud even

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
if you could get the same class of

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,000
service from the mainframe

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,919
but what they want to do is say how do i

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,919
reinvent

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,360
the way that i'm updating these

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,919
applications to work

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,080
in to work in a new way to bring you

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,120
know agile techniques and devops

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,600
methods to the fore with my engineers

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,320
and then give them different ways to do

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,399
that work

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,919
so that they're they're taking all of

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,360
these things that we've learned on other

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,159
platforms and applying them to the

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,080
mainframe

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
mainframe is going to be around for

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,919
another 50 years

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,360
absolutely but it will be it'll continue

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,600
to be reinvented

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,440
and as vendors in a community we're

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,760
going to embrace that in new ways and

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
you know apis is is a good example of

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,559
that

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,159
more and more capabilities it's

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,279
important that they're exposed through

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,080
apis

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,320
in in many ways more so than what you

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,559
are directly exposing to

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,000
users through user interface because you

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,039
can't possibly

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,640
anticipate all of the users needs and

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,279
you'll you'll continue to see i think

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,760
from bmc you know and compyware

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,399
uh robust investment but all of the

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,480
other

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,159
vendors who are looking at this platform

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
as a long-term

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
you know place where their customers are

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,159
going to

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,520
absolutely absolutely and i know jen

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,559
maybe to you here

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,120
as you know when i talk apis and

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,240
the api first mentality developer

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,480
advocate for those

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,440
just connect right together tell me what

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,559
you're seeing

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,840
yeah so apis definitely have are

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,960
the the latest trend buzz

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,200
whatever you want for how you're going

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,080
to integrate and if i look back at

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,279
what's happened with

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,960
z os so when z os connect came out from

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,039
ibm it was so much excitement because

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,039
you can make rest calls into kicks and

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,799
db2 and ims and all these

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,240
traditional systems and oh my gosh we

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,960
don't have to change our code we can

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
just

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,880
basically make them like rest enabled um

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,440
and also that opened up

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
so many doors but if you've been

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
watching since then we've actually

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
enabled more

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
ways to use apis with z so it's always a

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,320
great example

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,200
um you can manage your system uh through

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
apis

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,720
but if you also watch what some of the

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,120
other teams that are doing across

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,320
companies that work on z os so like i'm

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,440
going to pick on kicks i'm here in

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,279
hersley

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,799
i get to hear a lot from the kick scene

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,559
they released um

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,399
the ability to use graphql with their

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,799
kicks explorer so you can actually

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,640
manage your kicks plexes and see what's

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,320
going on with them through graphql which

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,399
is another api that's

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,080
you know it's open source technology

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,919
that now you can use

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,760
to manage kicks that's just one example

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,760
because api first

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,919
is the way going forward it is an easier

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,679
way to to manage your system it is an

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,760
easier way to integrate your systems

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,679
um so if you're not looking for the ways

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,600
to exploit your technology

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,840
using apis you're going to start missing

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,880
the boat um because it just allows so

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,120
many different things to connect

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
and and jack remember and jen you

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,919
remember when you asked me the

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,559
questions that uh viva could answer

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
well we're going through the restful

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,440
apis

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,279
and um also zeo smf and all those things

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,360
so uh it's taking advantage of all

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,120
you know the labs that are building this

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,760
this api first

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,760
technology

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,760
absolutely absolutely and and len i

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,760
would imagine you know you're working

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,840
with the leading financial institutions

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,000
um you know in our country and in our

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,600
world i would imagine they're thinking

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,039
the same thing as this api first

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,640
mentality as well

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,000
oh yeah oh yeah they are

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,240
very much so awesome awesome

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,240
well we'll wrap up on one last question

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,240
and i'm asking you all to look forward

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,360
looked into the future devops in the

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,360
mainframe

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,960
um and sam maybe we'll start with you on

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,240
this one and len and jen

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,440
you know tell us what you're thinking

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
what is the future of devops and

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,480
mainframe look like

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,640
in your world i think it is

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,799
the just the normal way that people

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,519
operate i think if you were to look

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,880
forward

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,039
say you know even five or ten years

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,760
the way that people manage their

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,399
mainframes will have been transformed

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,880
you know and it it will naturally evolve

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,320
into a platform that is tightly knit

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,799
into the practices that are used for

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,000
both

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,240
operation in you know in terms

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,320
and development of all the other

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,320
platforms that are predominant

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,640
and you know mainframe and cloud really

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,240
are incredibly complementary

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,960
so today you know there are very few

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,480
true commodity applications that make

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,159
you know that are on a mainframe as i

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,240
said you know i think i mentioned before

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,720
you think about two platform it's the

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,399
strategy that compuware has long pursued

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,559
yeah i'm not gonna run email on my

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,000
mainframe but what i am gonna continue

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,799
to run for the next 50

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,519
years are applications that have unique

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,600
compliance scalability security and

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,720
auditability requirements

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,240
and those applications will be developed

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,200
using continuous delivery practices and

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,799
a developer experience that is equal to

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,039
any other platform

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,840
so that our developers on the mainframe

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,120
are

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,679
excited that they can enter the platform

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,600
without years and years of specialized

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,159
training or apprenticeship

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,480
because skills is one of the biggest

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,200
issues that customers talk about

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,519
but you don't you don't just fix skills

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,840
with one thing there's no silver bullet

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,159
so it takes investment in terms of

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,080
hiring and mentoring and culture

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,320
to really attract people to work on the

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,519
platform and it also takes a great

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,559
developer experience

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,039
you know that's certainly something

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,799
compuwer is going to focus on every day

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,240
i have people who get out of bed and

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,240
just obsess about that

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,760
every day to make sure we can make

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,159
happier developers

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,840
and everything that we've talked about

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,240
is part and parcel to that

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,640
so you're going to see continued

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,840
evolution of commercial tools

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,240
that plug into both you know open source

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,000
technologies so things you know if you

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,080
think about ci tools like

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,320
jenkins which is a it's both an open

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,760
source project and a commercial offering

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,840
i think that's one of the trends that

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,720
will bubble up bubble up as you continue

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,399
to see

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,200
that open source mentality applied to

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,039
some of the mainframe technologies but

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,000
it's absolutely going to be a very

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,360
different world

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,679
you will see operations that is

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,879
supported by assistive technology

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,679
machine learning

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,679
and ai ops and this is where you know

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,000
bmc is going into the future

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,960
we you know they have a an amazing

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
vision for

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,280
enterprise devops on the development

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
side and these application of

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,119
technologies that

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,399
really help people to proactively manage

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,280
their mainframes

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,200
in ways that are almost hard to imagine

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,320
now because we're really kind of in many

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,919
ways still

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,240
flying biplanes and pretty pretty soon

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,119
you know when soon is five years you

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,760
know in

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,839
beginning right now we're gonna have

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,560
mainframe installations that are

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,679
managed you know by systems that are the

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,200
equivalent of

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,760
autopilots in our latest airliners that

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,720
can

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,560
actually do incredibly complex tasks not

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,640
just sort of keep things on the level

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,680
but actually take off and land

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,760
an automation that anticipates problems

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,520
and prevents them from happening

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,520
people have that in a vision now but

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,400
it's only just starting to be realized

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,160
so

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,440
all of that is going to require that

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,480
customers invest in an api strategy

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,960
that they really look at developers as

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,240
high performance athletes that can be

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,640
encouraged

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,839
and and draw and help them to be

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,480
successful

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,640
so they'll implement practices like

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,680
automation to support those development

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,480
activities

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,839
integrated sets of third-party tools and

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,880
measurement

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,280
to really help their their developers be

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,800
amazing contributors to those

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,800
applications that run

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,000
on the mainframe platform because it's

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
the only platform

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,280
that can host those applications and

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,280
meet all their requirements

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,280
it's a great look at the future there

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,560
definitely a definitely an exciting look

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,640
at the future there

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,960
uh len uh jen what would you want to add

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,359
to that

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:07,680
uh jen want me to go yeah okay sure

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,680
um i i kind of look at it

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:15,839
in a perspective of

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,599
family as you can imagine with a last

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,760
name like mine

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,359
italian families are a very important

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,880
thing

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,240
and the best way

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,000
to get collaboration and cooperation

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,320
is treating someone like family

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,320
the mainframe and all the other

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,720
alternative platforms that are within

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
organizations if they start treating

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,880
each other like family

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,200
all become part of devops all become

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,200
part of cicd

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,560
watch things happen in a very positive

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,240
way

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:58,000
and it will be for the betterment

00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,720
of the mainframe and the betterment

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
of the other platforms that sometimes

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,240
try to ignore

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,440
the mainframe or pretend it doesn't

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,640
exist or

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,560
don't want anything to do with it

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,000
whatever you want to say

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:16,400
and once this is all united

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,200
following the policies of devops cicd

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,839
the future of the mainframe will be as

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,119
bright

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,000
as that sun that we see on this slide

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,040
it's a very very very bright future when

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,160
when all this

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,040
finally comes together jen how about you

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,599
yeah i love the analogy of family there

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,200
um

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,359
i think it is exactly that and i think

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,160
particularly collaborating more in the

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,359
open source

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,359
forum is really enabling that um

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,800
as we continue to move forward and look

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,119
to the future

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,400
as everybody is collaborating together

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,480
all the different languages

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,000
all the different tools they are just

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,440
that they're just tools

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,040
because we now can have you know

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,720
standard interfaces through things like

00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,400
apis or even cli

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,800
we can pick and choose and have a

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,359
standard kind of tool set

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,040
to create whatever we need so we're not

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,040
kind of putting the mainframe over here

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,440
in its little box in the corner anymore

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,400
we're saying it is one of the platforms

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
you can use

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,119
the tools that you're using across all

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,839
the other ones you can actually start to

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,760
use those

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,280
or you are already using those with your

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,520
mainframe and that will just continue to

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,720
evolve through all of this collaboration

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,720
um it becomes a matter of you know

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,160
my mom and i would both love to cook but

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,680
if you give us the same recipe we're

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,119
gonna go about it differently

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,800
she's gonna have her preferred methods

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,920
i'm going to have mine

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,680
but at the end of the day we end up with

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,280
the exact same thing and that's what

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,800
it's really all about so if we can

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,599
collaborate to find the best

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,720
of those methodologies um that's what

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,040
all of this is about

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,640
so we have the best of both worlds and

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,760
we can have the best solution and the

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,599
end and build on

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,280
all those years of experience so like

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,440
all the experience my mom has of making

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,280
the absolutely perfect pie crust

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,119
i'm still perfecting mine she's got it

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
down i'm gonna pick up some of her

00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,839
techniques

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,960
and i'm gonna add in some of my new ones

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,160
and that's exactly what we're doing with

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
all this collaboration what we're seeing

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,280
with devops

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,880
to really have the best possible uh

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,000
platform in the future

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,040
