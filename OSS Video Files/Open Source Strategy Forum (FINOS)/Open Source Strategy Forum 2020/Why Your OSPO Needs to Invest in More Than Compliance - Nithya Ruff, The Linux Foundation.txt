hey

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,480
hi everyone good afternoon good morning

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,599
good evening

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
uh wherever you're calling in from um

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,000
one of the beauties of virtual

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,039
conferences like the open source

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,080
strategy summit

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,680
is that you can join from anywhere

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,880
um i'm nithya ruff and i head the

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,679
open source program office at comcast

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,719
and i also chair the linux foundation

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,880
board

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
and i want to talk to you about a very

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,160
important topic

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,280
most companies are nowadays establishing

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,960
an open source program office and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
i want to convince you by the end of the

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
presentation

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,920
why you need to do more than compliance

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
in your program office in order to get

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,239
the most

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,960
out of your investment in open source

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,840
you can follow me on twitter at nithya

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,080
rough

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,960
and if you have any questions during my

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,760
presentation please feel free to ask me

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,240
on the chat function and i'm happy to

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,439
answer any questions that you have

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,880
so let's get started um

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,720
just to introduce myself uh i

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,400
characterize myself in a number of

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,960
different ways or there are so many

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,479
different

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,479
aspects to each of us right one of the

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,079
the aspects that i'm very proud of is

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,200
that i'm a tech woman

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,560
i started uh in computer science and as

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,159
a developer

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,200
and i continue to be someone who works

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,000
in technology

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,119
and believes in technology and is an

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,479
advocate for

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,680
technic women in technology

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,000
um i am a huge believer

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,320
in the power of open source and

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,320
collaborative development and

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,520
and collaboration as a means of

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,960
innovation

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,920
and i lead that at comcast

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,320
and i encourage that in the

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,800
organizations that i mentor

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,599
i'm also a board member of the linux

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
foundation

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,080
also of a number of other boards i am an

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,200
advisory member there

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,440
um and i really believe

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,480
that as a leader you need to be an

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,920
inclusive leader

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,520
we are a global world and we are a

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,400
connected world

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,720
and you bring out the best in people

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
when you truly value and include them in

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,440
everything you do

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
so you can see the organizations that

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
i'm

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,280
most closely affiliated with today

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,920
so let's move to the topic at hand

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
to me moving to open source especially

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
as a company

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
is not just a switch you know you just

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
turn on the switch and you're all of a

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,800
sudden an open source

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,360
company or savvy with open source or

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,920
working with open source you really

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
are on a journey to open source and

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,959
we'll talk about

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
why and the journey is often never

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
complete

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
as open source evolves as the company

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,239
evolves its business evolves

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,319
you are always working towards

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,560
you know more and more engagement in

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,040
open source

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
one of the first ways companies get

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
involved

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
is making that transition if you will

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
from

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,480
being very dependent upon vendors to

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
actually starting to develop software

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
themselves

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,080
and in the course of developing that

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,440
software they start consuming

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,440
open source software so let's talk about

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
some of the activities that happen when

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
you move

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,599
in your journey from dependency to

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,720
consumption

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,760
so when you're dependent upon vendors

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,879
you really look to the vendors

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,760
for road maps for updates on what

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,519
features are coming out next uh it's

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,080
often a black box until you

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
kind of hear about the road maps you

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
spend

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
a good chunk of money on your commercial

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,439
license with its perpetual

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,639
subscription you are highly reliable

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,079
relied on vendors if you will for

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,400
features functions support direction

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,240
etc and that direction may not always

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
align with the direction that you want

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,199
to go

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
and you're just one of many customers so

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,360
it's hard to convince

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
you know a vendor to change direction

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
because of you

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,639
of course you don't get access to the

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,000
source code very often

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
and you are operating the vendor

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
solution

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,520
you're not creating it or customizing it

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,440
or changing it

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
so many companies say in the last 20

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
years

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
have started seeing open source come

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,000
into the company

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,080
sometimes from the bottoms up where

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,039
developers bring in open source

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,800
into their solutions or you can even

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,120
find it coming in through vendor

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,000
solutions because vendors are using open

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,240
source libraries or components

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,160
and uh open source also is very mature

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,199
in many different uh areas of technology

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,720
and there's a lot of open source options

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,160
available uh in the industry

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,919
to choose from so all of this plus the

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
fact that

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,360
there's an initial perception that open

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,039
source is free

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,080
and cheap or less expensive and so

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
you find that companies start consuming

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,840
open source

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
and it starts coming into the company

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
from an

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,720
uh from a consumption perspective

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,759
so let's discuss the fact that

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
companies also feel that open source is

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,560
moving

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
at such a rapid pace in so many

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
different areas especially

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,280
infrastructure

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,400
that they feel that it not only helps

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,520
them cut cost

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,720
but it speeds the innovation process and

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,000
it helps them stay

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,039
competitive in fact today it is table

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,919
sticks

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,000
if you don't consume open source you are

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,199
losing out on a competitive advantage

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,280
because

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,039
everyone else in the industry that you

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,680
play in may be using

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,680
open source and thereby getting the

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
advantages of using open source

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,160
so let's go to the next stage which is

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
okay now you've started consuming

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
open source and it typically leads to

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
compliance

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
what does that mean when you use open

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
source

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
one of the conditions of using that open

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,240
source is

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,680
that you respect the licenses that are

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,759
associated with

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,880
open source software the price of

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,639
using open source if you will is that

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,280
you comply with the obligations that the

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
license

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,880
includes so legal teams often get

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
involved

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,160
once consumption starts getting to be

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,199
quite prevalent in the organization

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,440
and legal teams often have questions on

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
are you using it correctly are you

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,400
linking it correctly to

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,520
our proprietary software are you

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,960
using permissive licenses or copyleft

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
licenses

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,000
and are you tracking those licenses are

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
you making sure that the community that

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
you're taking that license or that

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,120
software from

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,919
is a healthy community which means that

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
it is an active community that it has a

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,919
lot of

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,919
work going on it's keeping up with

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,199
security it's keeping up with

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,680
engagement of developers uh it's not

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
just

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,720
you know one person uh supporting it and

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,560
if that one person goes away

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
then the health of the community suffers

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,240
or the project has to shut down

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
so you find that a legal starts getting

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
involved

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
in both guidelines around what you use

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
how you use it

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,879
how you link it and then if you're

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,199
actually distributing

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
the product that you're using it in

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,160
outside the company

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,440
legal gets involved in

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,919
really defining how you present

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
the disclosure notice or the bill of

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
materials

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,400
to your customers because that is an

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
obligation

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,479
that's triggered when you start

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,279
distributing your software

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,919
so inevitably companies have to do

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,640
compliance

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,200
and it frankly respects open source

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,919
norms

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
if you're getting something from someone

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,760
the least you can do

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
is respect the conditions with which

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,399
they provide

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,800
that software and it also helps you

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,640
mitigate risk in the way you use it the

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,080
way you link to it

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,880
the way you track it etc and it becomes

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
a must do

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,800
so organizations feel if they consume

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,080
they have to comply and that's a good

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,279
thing compliance

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
is always good

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,800
the next step is a little harder

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,040
so company is complying

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
but there really is no motivation to

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,880
contribute back

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,160
in fact culturally it's hard for

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
companies to think about

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,000
why should i contribute back

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,560
it's something i created if they make

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,120
some customizations for example or they

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,320
create

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
new features and functions they often

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,480
think of it

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,959
as a competitive advantage their ip

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,480
and that if they contribute it that they

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,519
will be advantaging

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,760
someone else particularly competition so

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,800
there's often a cultural kind of

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,080
aversion to contribution plus it takes a

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,440
lot of time

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,519
to package it correctly into a patch

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,880
working with the community making sure

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
it gets accepted

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
and understanding the community that

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,519
you're working with its

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,120
norms and the way you need to contribute

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,800
so there's a lot of friction to

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
contribution

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
and there's a lot of slowness to

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,839
contributions so many

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,959
organizations don't even contribute but

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
what i'd like to say

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,399
is contribution is critical contribution

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
is important

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
and you need to do it for the following

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,399
reasons

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,640
it reduces technical debt so if you're

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
making changes if you're customizing

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,440
your software

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,079
it really is important that you mainline

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
it

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,040
or you upstream that contribution so

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,000
that you're not bearing the burden of

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
all of those changes and you're missing

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,880
out

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,880
on some of the innovation

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,920
that happens in the main line and you're

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,240
missing out on security patches

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,880
and other alerts that come out if you

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
are a branch and if you're kind of

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
veered away

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
from the main line so from a technical

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,200
debt perspective

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,320
it totally makes sense for a company to

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
upstream

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,279
the changes that they make and

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,640
constantly make sure that they are

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,560
in line with the main branch and they

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,519
get the benefits of the main branch they

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,920
reduce the cost of their support

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
so you know business case wise it just

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
totally makes sense that they spend the

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
time to do it

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
the second reason you need to upstream

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,760
you need to

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,480
contribute back is

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,920
in open source you earn trust you earn

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,240
credibility you earn

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,000
influence through the amount of

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,200
contribution that you make to the

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,800
project so if you

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,440
are just consuming and just being absent

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
and not

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,920
engaging with that community you're not

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
in the mailing list you're not

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,959
you know weighing in on

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:05,120
direction or contributing code

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:07,519
or contributing financially or otherwise

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,480
you really lose your seat at the table

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
and influence

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,040
and many of us as companies need to

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
make sure our commits are accepted you

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
know in a smooth way

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,360
and we also sometimes need to

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,880
argue and convince the rest of the

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
project that they need to move in a

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,519
certain direction so

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,079
influence is important and being at the

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,279
table

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,720
is important and often that comes with

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,440
contribution

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
and i also want to mention that if we

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
keep taking

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,360
and never giving back to open source

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
open source

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,760
will die open source will go away

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,040
and so from a sustaining of open source

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,639
that very golden the goose if you will

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,399
that lays the golden egg

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,720
that we all consume you do need to

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,160
contribute back you do need to make sure

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
that it is healthy

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,920
and it continues right it benefits us

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,480
all

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,920
and contribution can be of any kind you

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
don't have to always do good

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,360
contributions you can do

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,760
money you can do evangelization

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,079
you can do documentation you can

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,160
participate in the governance you can be

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,040
an advisor to the project

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,560
so you really can do a lot of things

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,959
from a contribution perspective

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,320
so to conclude what i want to say is

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,920
the value you get from open source

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,199
really increases with contribution and

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,760
the success of open source relies on

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,720
companies not just consuming

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,839
but being active participants and

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,199
contributing

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,680
to open source

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,240
now let's discuss how you can go even

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,120
beyond contribution

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,040
many companies these days are starting

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,600
open source projects themselves

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,120
so they may create something that works

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,160
for them

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
it may be an original piece of work and

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,399
by releasing these projects to

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,680
open source they enrich open source they

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,480
make it available for other companies

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
and others

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,240
in the open source community to use it

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
and they advance

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
if you will the technology in in

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,480
different ways

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,240
and and from a strategic perspective for

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,079
the company itself there's a lot of

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,279
advantages to releasing

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,600
an open source project let's i mean the

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,800
softer advantages of thought leadership

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,160
for example

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,000
or recruiting developers because

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
they're attracted to the good work that

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,079
you're doing they're

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
really important reasons but you can

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,560
also set a standard

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
so in a certain space if you feel that

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,560
there are

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:58,160
many different variable

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,600
ways to do something you can standardize

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,959
on one way of doing it which is perhaps

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,000
the way that you do and you rally

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,800
the community around that standard and

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,760
thereby

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,399
you kind of create an advantage for

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,240
yourself

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
through creating a standard that's

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,680
influenced by you

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,600
you can build an ecosystem around an sdk

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,720
a software development kit or an api

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,079
so if you need to onboard partners you

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,880
need to onboard

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,399
a community to a certain interface

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
there's nothing better than open

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,240
sourcing it and having them

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,320
consume it and use it in their products

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,360
you can also commoditize the space if

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
there is a

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,920
dominant dominant you know proprietary

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,199
uh vendor or solution in a certain space

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,199
you can influence a reduction of

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,480
the price for that particular product

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,199
for example

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,839
through open sourcing a competitive

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,839
solution

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,160
or backing a competitive solution and

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,279
sharing your experience you know many of

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,639
us

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,440
for instance my company does networking

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,880
at scale

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,800
does entertainment and

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,279
content distribution at scale so by

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,519
sharing production ready

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,560
and high quality production quality

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,120
software you really are helping

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,920
others improve their practices and

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,959
improve

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,639
how they do software

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,759
so to me this is a stage where you start

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
unlocking

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,519
even more strategic value from open

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
source

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,759
and some of the leading companies in

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,839
open source really do this

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,959
um but it's us we we do some of this at

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
comcast

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,519
we've released our apache traffic

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,480
control server we've released

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
and collaborated with other companies on

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
a common

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,520
stack for uh set-top boxes

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,360
and for other things in the cloud native

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,839
space

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,799
a lot of other companies do this very

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,799
very actively

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,079
let's talk about nirvana or the kind of

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,439
one of the final stages

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,679
if you will of achievement or

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,799
something that's an outcome that we all

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,600
look for

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,760
which is how do you then change the

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,919
culture of development inside your

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,600
organization

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,160
an open source program office in

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,559
particular can very systematically help

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,120
you

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,679
do that transform the development

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,160
culture

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,960
transform how we do talent acquisition

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,000
retention

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,160
development how we work with procurement

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
how we work with legal marketing

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,919
communications

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,080
and and development fundamental

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,480
development practices itself

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
uh and the culture of collaboration

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
inside a company

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
is something that an open source program

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,000
office can certainly

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,559
lead and coordinate and help create

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
and i think open source program offices

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,640
also

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,200
really help companies uh to coordinate

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
uh better both inside and outside the

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
company

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,280
and make open source more intentional

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,559
and more organized so to me

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
the best impact the highest value can be

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,480
got

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,679
if you move to the culture change

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
stage and you really create a culture of

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,160
collaboration

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,120
coordination leading and

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,600
organized and intentional work in open

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,720
source

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,880
when you look at this survey from the to

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,679
do group which is talk openly develop

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
openly an

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,679
organization in the linux foundation

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,280
that helps companies start open source

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,480
program offices

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,720
helps give you a venue if you will for

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,240
sharing practices across open source

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,440
program offices

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
you find that technology companies for

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,520
sure

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
are high adopters of the ospo

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
but companies like comcast which are

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,559
telecoms

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,440
and communication and media are also

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,080
building open source program offices but

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,039
you can see

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,760
finance is one of the fastest growing

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,799
areas

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,320
for program offices in

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:34,799
the industry it went from 28

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,799
to 47 from 2019 to 2020.

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,640
so it's a practice that's i think very

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:44,240
valuable for financial institutions

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,200
you also find that often the open source

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
program office

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,679
can be located in many different places

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,760
but in my experience

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,559
it's best located or reporting structure

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,360
to be in the software engineering and

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,960
development

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,039
organization or in the cto function

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,360
because it's all about developer

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,120
advocacy developer relations

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,320
culture change of development and

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,840
it belongs there it's easier to create

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,400
transformation

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,480
in the development organization than to

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
coming in from the outside

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,520
telling development to change culture

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,080
and you really need to understand

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,080
the development culture inside your

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,440
company before you can

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,559
advocate change i've seen it in legal

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,880
i've seen it in marketing but i think

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,760
uh it's most effective than it is in

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,000
engineering

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,120
or in cto um number of people in an open

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,919
source program office

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,440
varies you can do it part-time you can

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,080
have someone doing it part-time if

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
you're a small

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,480
organization all the way to

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,799
you know 35 40 50 people

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,679
in an organization it also depends upon

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,080
the scope of the

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,159
hospital if the open source program

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,200
office is only doing

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,360
marketing or contributions

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,720
but not the compliance function it may

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,120
be smaller

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,679
but if it's doing the breadth of what

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,360
open source program offices can do

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,840
then it tends to be larger

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,080
and you find that the longer the open

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,280
source program office is in a company

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,840
the more successful the more value

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,440
it gets the more traction it gets the

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,440
more respect it gets

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
in an organization and it becomes a very

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
critical function in an organization

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,360
at comcast we've been in place for four

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,919
years

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,559
and i must admit that it is a very

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
critical

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,679
organization in the company it's highly

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,520
supported from the executive team

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,320
from our developers and from our

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,039
managers and it's it's become a part of

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,039
our culture

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,039
and how we work and how we develop

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
so you know i just wanted to kind of

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,600
summarize

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,480
with the fact that i work in comcast

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,919
we are no longer a cable company who's

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,880
vendor dependent

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
we are very much a transformed company

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,520
we are

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,000
in the technology business we use

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,799
technology to serve our customers better

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,320
to interact better with our customers in

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,400
a digital way

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,760
we create platforms and applications

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,159
using software

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,400
particularly open source software we

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,400
highly lean into open source

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
and we care deeply about customer

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,880
experience which

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,919
drives our desire to touch

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,840
and digitize and transform

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,720
our software products so that we can

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,960
serve our customers better

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,400
and we went through the same stages we

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,400
went from a vendor dependency in 2006

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,440
uh to consumption around 2011.

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,320
we started contributing as early as then

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,240
um and you know we started creating an

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
open source advisory body

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,919
it was a lot of part-time folks if you

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
will

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,400
who supported uh the company from an

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,440
open source perspective

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,360
and around 2014-15 the company really

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
came to a conclusion that

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,120
we were doing so much open source we

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
were doing it so much at scale

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,720
and we wanted to be transformed we

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,280
wanted to get

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,400
the the best impact from our investment

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,880
in open source

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,840
and so we established an ospo and i came

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,640
on board

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,039
to help build that ospo and we have a

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,200
very

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,880
thriving and very engaged very active

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
open source program office in the

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,559
company that's working on everything

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
from process to compliance to community

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,799
building

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,080
to evangelizing and culture change

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:54,320
and it's been in my

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,760
opinion helped the business value

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,679
increase um with great engagement

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,720
so the investment that we've made in

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,120
open source is really paying off

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,240
from speed to market to cost reduction

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
to culture change

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,679
better development practices better

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,679
technical branding better recruiting etc

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,159
and you can find a lot of the projects

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,279
that we've open sourced as a company

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,919
in comcast.github.io

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,840
you'll find a variety of things that we

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,679
kind of house here

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,480
one we have an innovation grant that we

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
often give

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,159
to organizations that apply for the

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,240
grant

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,840
it is open source projects its

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,640
universities doing

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,679
research in areas that we deeply care

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,919
about

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,600
so we feature that here so that open

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,640
source projects can actually

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,799
apply we also feature

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
uh projects that we have open sourced

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,120
and you can get involved in becoming a

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,159
contributor to those projects here

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,559
it's nicely categorized and easy

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159
to find an infrastructure project versus

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,760
a front-end project

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:11,200
etc we also house all of the talks

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,919
all of the podcasts all of the articles

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,520
we've done

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,000
on open source it gives you a sense of

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,840
you know culturally and philosophically

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
how we think about open source

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,840
why from a business perspective we think

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,640
it makes sense for us to support open

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,960
source

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
and why we enjoy being a part of the

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,440
community

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,320
you can also find a contact so you want

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,799
to make it

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
really really easy for people to contact

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,320
us should there

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,559
be a question should there be an issue

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,679
that they want to escalate or raise with

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,799
us

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,919
and we've been also doing blogs

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,559
on some of our new projects and

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
some of the events that we've attended

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,279
and

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,720
talked to i want to briefly talk about

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,919
metrics

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,840
it's very important to measure the

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
effectiveness of your open source

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,799
program work

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,000
so that you can continue to communicate

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,640
business value to your executive

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
team but also show that you're aligned

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,919
with business objectives of the company

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,480
and helping the company

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,960
achieve its business objectives i

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,400
measure

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,200
the following things one is i

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,880
want to know that the investment in the

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
open source program office is being

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,799
effective

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,320
and that our processes and practices are

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,760
effective so the

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,159
effectiveness of the organization called

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,919
open source program office itself is

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,080
important

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,240
the second area is community

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,080
effectiveness how effective

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,279
are we in the communities that we

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,080
participate in

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,360
how at what level are we engaging are we

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,520
contributing

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,520
what type of influence do we have what

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,159
community should we be even

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,640
you know participating in project

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,960
effectiveness really addresses

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
of the projects that we open source how

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,279
effective are we

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,279
in maintaining those projects how many

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,880
stars are we getting are we getting

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,600
external contributors

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,120
working in the project is this project

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,159
healthy

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,440
do we have the right set up for

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:27,039
engagement and culture and inclusion

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,159
talent recruiting is a really huge

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,840
byproduct if you will of open source

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,320
um so we want to track

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,120
people coming into the company because

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,159
they

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,880
like how we work in open source and that

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,279
they can

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
work in open source if they come into

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,880
the company

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,200
so we look at that we also look at um

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,640
from a promotion and a career

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
perspective

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,720
are you doing open source so for example

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,840
in our technical ladder

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,480
one of the criteria for promotion is

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,960
uh are you contributing back to open

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,000
source

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,240
are you volunteering in some way with

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,760
the open source program office

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,760
are you speaking at conferences

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,840
are you being a thought leader in open

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,559
source and all of these things

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,240
help build the case for you to move up

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,880
the technical ladder if you will to

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,880
distinguish

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,600
engineer follow etc an engagement from a

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,279
marketing

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,200
and communications perspective is

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,880
something else we measure

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,440
we look at the number of events we

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,840
attend the number of blogs we post

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,640
sponsorship we do what's kind of the

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,080
perception

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,039
of the developer audience in

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,720
comcast's community engagement and

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,279
sometimes it's difficult to measure

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,559
business impact but we would like to

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,880
and we continue to work hard to say

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,360
what business impact did open source

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,240
make on the company

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,080
did it help us get to market faster did

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,279
it cut costs did it improve reliability

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,480
and so i continue to work hard to

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,120
measure the business impact

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
i want to conclude this presentation by

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,880
saying that

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,600
open source is really a key part of our

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,919
innovation

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,720
and should be a key part of any

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,039
company's

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,240
innovation and you really need to

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,200
move past consumption and compliance

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,440
if you want to get maximum benefit from

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,080
your investment in open source

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,600
so i hope i've convinced you of the

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,120
journey you can take

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,200
the value return that you can get

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,240
as you get more and more involved in

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,480
open source

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,600
and i'm happy to address any questions

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,600
you have

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,399
and also to help be a mentor

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,679
to your organization on your journey to

00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:08,240
open source

00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:10,320
thank you and have a wonderful day

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,320
