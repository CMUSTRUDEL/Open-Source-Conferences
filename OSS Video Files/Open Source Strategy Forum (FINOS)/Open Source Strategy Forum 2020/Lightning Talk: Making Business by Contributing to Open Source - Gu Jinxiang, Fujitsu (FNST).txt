lead of open source team in 1940s

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,080
nanda software technology

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,080
my topic is making venus by contributing

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,359
to open source

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,119
i'm honored to share our experience with

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,560
you

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,560
okay let's start

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,719
in this topic i'll introduce my company

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,079
in short and they introduce key points

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,000
on making business by contributing to

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
open source in detail

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,320
first let's start from the company

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
profile

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,600
our company name is nanjing fujitsu

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,320
now software technology and we always

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
call it

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,960
fnst for short

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,240
it is a small company established

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,680
as a joint venture between fuji's

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,720
and nanjing university of china

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,759
in 1999

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,759
fujits is a top level company

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,119
in the world an anandian university

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,880
is one of the top five universities

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,000
in china fmst

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,680
their joint venture company can learn

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,360
from which is

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,079
development experience and attract

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,079
top level talents from china

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,240
our camp our open source team was

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,600
established in 2003

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,640
since then we have participated

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
in the community work on many open

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
source

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,959
projects in many fields

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,560
including venus os virtualization

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,840
database compiler

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,599
storage and so on

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,640
of course the investment on

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,280
effort of each project

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,280
is different

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,879
this is the kind of contributions

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,480
we have made in open source community

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,519
since 2003

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,200
as of 2019

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,519
our number of commits have got over

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,360
15 000.

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,080
before 2012 all of the work

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
of the open source team came from

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,440
physics

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,360
in 2012 fnst

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,599
already had a certain influence in china

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,560
in the field of open source working

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,840
we began to think about what errors

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,840
could be brought

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
by contributing to open source

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,920
back then the domestic electric

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,959
power company came to seek corruption

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,280
with us on linux

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:39,920
so start from then we began to explore

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,920
how to turn the effort to business

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,040
after so many years of exploration

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,040
we have summarized three key points

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,319
the first is to find out the core

00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:05,439
competitiveness and extract

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,439
what service or product can be provided

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,519
as mentioned above we have invested

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,799
in open source projects in many fields

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,079
but the investment and the influence of

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,040
each project

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,040
are not the same

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,080
therefore based on but not limited

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,759
to mark the demand the number of

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,240
millionaires

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,440
modulo coverage number of patches

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,639
we have selected our most advantageous

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,800
venus area that

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,960
is linux os os virtualization

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,960
and software defined storage

00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,000
many companies use open source software

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,039
in their products but the community

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
activities

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:08,320
of open source software are not enough

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
to meet the business needs of them

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:17,360
based on this within us as a core

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,800
we have defined the f1 os service

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,000
providing oss consulting

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,560
open source solution evolution

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,199
open source support and open source

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,199
customization services

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,280
among them open source support service

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:44,400
has also formulated constructing

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,400
service levels and service process

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,759
for example we can provide

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,600
private or public cloud selection

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,800
consulting service

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,199
for traditional industry and

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
provide professional performance

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,160
evolution tests

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,960
for embedded linux os

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,000
which can be used as a reference for

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,720
customers

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,720
with design their devices

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,560
and when customers need to

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:25,039
use cenos for customization

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,759
we can provide support service on xenos

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,639
even we can directly provide

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,639
customization

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,000
service

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,840
in addition to open source service

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,560
we have developed f1 cloud products

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
combined with the marketing needs based

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
on

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,599
open source we are committed

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
to providing basic service facilities

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:59,919
from ice to dust and can provide

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,919
such services in special things

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,080
it has also been optimized for specific

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,319
industries for example

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,919
for the automobile manufacturing

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,120
industry

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,520
the developed environment is template

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,520
and cicd tools are provided

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,440
for the energy industry gpu processor

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,000
was made to optimize the processing

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
speed

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
of big data

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,919
for the medical industry in order to

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,919
adapt to picture achieving and the

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,599
communication system

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,639
we optimized for writing massive

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,639
small first

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,840
ok we have defined what we can provide

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,720
and the next step is to identify target

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,240
customers

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
how did we achieve that

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,199
first we analyzed our service and

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,479
products everyone

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,039
service may solve the problem of not

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,039
knowing which open source software

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,199
should be used

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
all the open source software has been

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,680
used but

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
no service was provided to meet their

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
needs

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,479
the f1 cloud product

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,200
may solve the problem of cloudification

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
at this stage we focused on the

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
customers

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,560
in china based on the positioning

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:51,600
of the services products we can provide

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,720
we conduct market research

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,760
and analysis

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,040
we divide companies into small and

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,320
medium ones as well as

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:09,519
large traditional companies and large

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,920
ict companies large-scale ict companies

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,240
generally have their own professional

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
developed teams

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
and they are less likely to seek

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,959
external

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,959
teams or products

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,600
however small and medium-sized companies

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,320
or large traditional companies due to

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
the lack

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
of a professional open source developed

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,279
team

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,399
are very likely to seek assistance from

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,360
an external

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
professional team

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,560
among them companies that are already

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,080
open source users are likely to be

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
our targeted customers

00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,720
for example companies in the electric

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,959
power industry is older versions

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,760
of linux another community

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,440
of these virgins may have stopped

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,360
serving

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,399
or even if it is a version maintainer

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
by the community the community's

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
response

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,279
will not meet the requirements of the

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
commercial

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
company

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,160
there are also some commercial

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,279
companies need to customize because of

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,760
their specific

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,760
business

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,279
unless may not necessarily be adopted

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
by the community

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,920
for example customers

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
use build road to generate embedded

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
animals

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:59,120
by themselves an externals

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,120
on it needs certain adapting work

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,240
for another example when using

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,680
a container resource control is

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,440
also required for each application

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,120
in the container these companies

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,160
are our target customers because they

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,720
require special customization

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
of open source for special things

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,920
also some traditional industries

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,839
such as the energy industry require

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,440
cloudification to improve their

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,839
computing speed this is

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,839
also our target customer

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,519
the last point grow together

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,519
with open source

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,800
fnst has increased its visibility

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,200
in china through many years of

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,480
participation

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,320
in open source contribution

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,040
so customers can in the process

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,000
of serving customers we found

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,680
shortcomings

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,880
or boxing use after solving these

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,120
problems

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,120
we contribute them to the community

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,560
and it will increase our influence too

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,279
and this waterless cycle more customers

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
will be achieved
