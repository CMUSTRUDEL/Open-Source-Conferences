well

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,000
welcome everyone um to the uh

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,519
session on open source blockchain's

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
emerging role

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
as the platform for digital currencies

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
um

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
i'm kara notoni i'm with hyperledger

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,080
which is

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,680
a sister project to phenos at the linux

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
foundation

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,880
and i'm here with makoto takamiya

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,239
from soramitsu and we're going to have a

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,320
discussion today

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,360
on um cbdc's digital currency

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,040
defy and hear about the um

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,239
cbdc project that makoto has been

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
building for the last

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
couple of years we are recording the

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
session

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,800

what you do there um saramito is a

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,119
member of hyperledger

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,360
and um and you're very involved with the

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
hyperledger technology community

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
uh with the distributed ledger uh

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
hyperledger eroja

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,520
so please share a little bit about um

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,920
your involvement in our community

yeah sure so it's great to be with you

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
uh and

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,000
thanks a lot for the um the introduction

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,079
um

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,560
so my name is makoto takimiya i'm the

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,439
ceo of sorimitsu and uh for those who

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,240
may not know

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,280
sore mitsu is a i like to describe it as

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
a boutique

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
fintech startup we were originally based

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,960
in

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,360
in tokyo japan but now we're we're

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,520
actually in a few different countries

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,759
we are still a very young company we

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,759
were founded in 2016. and

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,840
actually just a few months after being

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,879
founded we joined a hyperledger project

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,160
which was a

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,239
actually a great honor for a small

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
startup like ours um

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
i'm actually a computer scientist by

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
background

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
uh i studied and and grew up in

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,520
california actually

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
and i got my computer science degree and

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
then uh

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,080
after that i moved to japan and worked

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,879
in the research lab uh studying

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
uh neuroinformatics actually for um for

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,480
more than

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
i think seven years so it's quite uh and

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
it's been an interesting journey that

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,920
brought me into blockchain

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,080
but i've been in this industry since

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,640
2013 and it's been really fascinating

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
and

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,560
i've had the honor of being part of many

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,440
different open source

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
blockchain projects

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,040
i can talk a little bit more about uh my

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,560
company and and what our vision is

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,599
uh so we uh we we kind of wanted to

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,159
build our own um kind of vision of

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,200
blockchain this is back in 2016 and we

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,480
were focusing on

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,000
uh digital identity at that time and uh

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,760
none of the current blockchains

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,599
uh at the time were really meeting our

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
needs and so that's kind of where

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,080
you know through discussion with our

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,640
engineers that's how we built uh this

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
this project called iroha that then we

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
uh

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
we gave to a linux foundation with other

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,840
um hyperledger members

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,040
uh back in 2016 and that got accepted as

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
an open source

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,319
one of the open source platforms in the

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
hyperledger project

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,400
so it's been it's been a long journey

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,879
but it's been very interesting

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
well thank you for that introduction um

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,599
so before we dive into talking more

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
about

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,400
your specific project um we might have

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,000
some newcomers to the topic

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,040
of defy also known as decentralized

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
finance

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,080
um to peer-to-peer payments and cbdc's

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,760
central bank digital currencies um

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
maybe you could just give a sense for

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,640
you know what are all these terms that

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,640
people are throwing out there um you

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,560
know defy now encompasses

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,920
uh stable coins and cryptocurrencies and

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,599
all kinds of different things and maybe

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,959
just kind of level set for

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,560
the audience here about um what's going

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,000
on in the peer-to-peer

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,400
uh payment space right now

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
so uh when people think of blockchain

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
and peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies they

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
typically think of bitcoin

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
which of course is the most famous and

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,080
uh kind of archetypal example

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,160
um but uh since bitcoin there's been

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,440
quite a lot of innovation over the past

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,840
uh you know 12 years and so since the

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,960
bitcoin white paper came out

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,000
and um uh it's just so much that it's

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
hard to even

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,440
figure out where to begin to talk about

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,479
but some of the the more recent and

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
exciting trends

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,600
are d fire decentralized finance and

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,759
this is an idea where you go beyond just

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,960
having a cryptocurrency and maybe some

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
you know peer-to-peer

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,639
payment system that's using a blockchain

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,320
and you actually provide more

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
um robust uh financial services on top

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
and an example would be like a

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,720
peer-to-peer loan where

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,800
uh you could have one token as an asset

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
that's a collateral and you can

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,400
either mint or provide a new type of

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
token

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,840
from this collateral and and this you

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,759
know it's just managed

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
automatically by the rules of the system

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,320
so you don't have to worry about things

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,520
like you know

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,520
people defaulting on loans or or

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
financial crisis like we had in maybe

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,800
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
on the other hand if you build the rules

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
of the system in a bad way you could

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
have new types of financial crises so

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
it's quite a

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
an interesting uh playground that's uh

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
that's doing quite a lot

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,880
now uh in the d5 sphere there's many

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,880
different types of

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,160
applications and of course things like

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
stable coins

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
for payment are very interesting and

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
there's different types of stable coins

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,199
so a stable coin typically is pegged to

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,319
some type of index like for example the

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,080
us dollar

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,319
and it could either be backed by real

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,560
dollars like in a vault or something

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
or it could be backed by another type of

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
currency that's actually equal to a

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,720
dollar or

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,880
or even worth more than the dollar like

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,520
something like a synthetic asset

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
that like if you want um you know one

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,319
dollar

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,520
uh but you only have ether then you can

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
actually put in you know

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,440
like maybe a dollar fifty worth of ether

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
into a smart contract and then you can

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
mint a new type of dollar stablecoin

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,319
and the innovation here is really not so

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,880
much as in these

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
you know these financial mechanics but

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,199
rather

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,120
the concept of composability so

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
by having this on a blockchain and all

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,199
these clear inputs and outputs from

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,479
these

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,400
different applications um you have just

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,120
you have what uh you know ibm i think

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,039
used to call the a the api economy

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
you actually have a way to create a

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,360
digital economy where everything is just

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
connected

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
by these you know kind of like api calls

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
or by interfaces

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,280
and you can build uh really really

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
complex

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,199
applications that even the designers of

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,400
maybe a piece of it couldn't have

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
envisioned before and

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,360
that's kind of like going on in the

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
public blockchain space so

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
there is some work in the hyperledger

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,720
project that's

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
contributing that but there's also many

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
more public

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
blockchains so for example you know the

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,520
of course the work in ethereum which now

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
is very closely related to hyperledger

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
and then there's

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,680
polkadot which is doing some really

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,360
interesting work there so our

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
uh our company actually works very

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,479
closely with web3 foundation which is a

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,599
non-profit in switzerland who's working

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
on building this kind of

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,720
interledger polka dot and kusama

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,680
protocols which is really an exciting

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,759
ecosystem

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,000
then you have countless other platforms

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
now this innovation is being done in the

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,440
completely open

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,599
and dare i say uh rather unregulated

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,520
space so this is kind of like a whole

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,520
bunch of you know computer sciences

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
and and you know people going out there

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,160
and playing around with different things

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,919
and this is really exciting because um

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,199
people are testing new things that never

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,000
existed before

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,960
um but on the other hand uh there are

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,879
very serious

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,599
financial institutions that are looking

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,599
at some of these concepts and figuring

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,120
figuring out how does this fit into the

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,039
existing existing

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,919
financial markets infrastructure so

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,680
central banks are one of these and

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
you know many central banks around the

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
world um are studying

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,039
uh you know so-called central bank

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,880
digital currencies and uh

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,800
and ways to take some of these concepts

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,320
of tokenized money

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,880
and uh and um you know build this in as

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
a

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,959
you know into the infrastructure of

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,240
their national economies which is quite

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,120
um quite a new idea um

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
bear assets that have value like cash

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,320
are nothing new

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,680
but uh doing this in a digital form is

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
very

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
very new for uh for banks to look at and

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
so

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,880
it also has new challenges um especially

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,839
regulatory challenges but

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,560
it also has quite a lot of very

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,880
potential to uh to

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,440
things that didn't exist yet and so the

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,760
whole the whole d5 space and the sea

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
space i think are very hot buzzwords now

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,680
in fact these

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
um i think this

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,000
have been and

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
i would say in the blockchain

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
well thanks for um sharing a little bit

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
about this

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,399
evolution of what's been happening in um

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
digital

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,279
currencies as you mentioned you know

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,120
bitcoin kind of started this it's

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,000
it is an open source technology um

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,839
it's public uh nobody owns it right or

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
controls and everyone can take part in

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,440
it and contribute to it and add to it

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,440
um do you think we could have gotten to

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,680
the point of central banks really

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
digitizing their currencies without

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,560
bitcoin if we didn't have

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,440
um that that star in this uh

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,760
open source technology that that uh

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,320
satoshi developed

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,480
well yeah that's a good question so it

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,279
was really bitcoin that started it all

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,880
obviously a lot of the ideas were not

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,040
completely new to bitcoin

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,360
you know the idea of uh you know digital

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,720
money or even like a tokenized uh

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,839
form of uh assets uh or tokens was uh

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
was nothing 100 new there were other

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,600
types of applications

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
but really what uh satoshi was able to

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,560
do was

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
you know make this in a way where

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,120
there's no central authority to take the

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,760
responsibility

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
or the blame um for building something

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
like that

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,600
and that that actually is what uh in

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,440
many ways enables uh

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
defy or decentralized finance

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
applications because

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
a lot of these experiments and ideas you

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,000
couldn't actually run

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,000
um you know because because the legal

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,160
structure hasn't potentially you know

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
caught up to that in many areas

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,800
so um uh satoshi created really like a

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,040
worldwide um

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
you know new type of supernatural

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,959
currency and

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
uh you know more than 10 years later uh

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,160
you know facebook

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,519
came out to do the same and they still

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
you know still haven't been able to

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640
succeed in that because of the

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,920
regulatory hurdles and so

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,800
um but satoshi didn't ask anyone he just

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,920
put it out there um but yeah the fact

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,079
that it's open source

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
uh gave a lot of resilience uh to

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,240
bitcoin obviously

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,839
no one would trust a closed source uh

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,200
payment system like that because you

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,399
know money is all based on

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,279
it's really a form of trust right um

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,880
and uh i would say that without bitcoin

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
central banks wouldn't really be

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,320
considering

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,079
um a tokenized version of central bank

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,800
liabilities either

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,240
because you know as we all know a

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,360
digital central bank money

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,560
already exists especially for wholesale

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,279
uses and the idea of creating something

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,680
like

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,800
akin to a bearer asset that's digital i

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,079
think is nothing

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,800
that would be considered

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,480
if you know bitcoin hadn't shown

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,079
potentially the utility of something

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
like this

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,240
and uh but bitcoin's just you know one

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
one small start i really don't think it

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
can be

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,279
you know over emphasized how important

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,279
uh

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,399
composability is in these spaces so

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,639
being able to have

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,240
some kind of token where the the

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,519
transfer the token transfers the

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
ownership

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,800
in real time you know the transfer is

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
the transfer not just

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,320
the token but ownership itself that's

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,720
really

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
a very powerful concept in many types of

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,519
financial markets infrastructure

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,279
and um and that i think is going to pave

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,040
a way to much

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,959
you know huge revolution in global

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,399
global financial markets

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,600
uh and uh hopefully um you know increase

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,120
the efficiency of

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
things like payments and settlements and

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
different types of you know fundraising

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,560
that uh

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,800
corporations do yeah yeah you know

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,000
before um

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,079
before d5 became sort of the coin term

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
the the term that was being used is open

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,440
finance

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,959
and um it's a real change that was

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
you know bitcoin is part of the

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
evolution and maybe it really kind of

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,040
kick-started things

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,360
um but you know uh

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,240
it's that openness that really is what's

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
different about

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,240
what's being done now and the fact that

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,880
it's you know tokenized or digital

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,160
therefore more transparent and more

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,279
accessible

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,760
um why do you think it's important

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,800
though

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,160
to use open source technologies

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,399
versus um you know something that

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,440
a government is just building in-house

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,920
or a company is just building a house

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
as their own technology why is open

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,639
source important

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
um in digital payments and more

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,839
specifically

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,920
in cbdc's i would argue that uh not just

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,160
open source but other types of open

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
technologies are very important for

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,920
advancing mankind

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
but uh just to specifically answer your

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
question um

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,760
so open source is really exciting for

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,680
new and innovative payment systems like

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,880
blockchain based or dlt-based

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,600
payment systems that haven't

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,680
existed before because if it's not open

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,480
then central banks or other types of

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,000
corporations wouldn't want to trust um

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
you know a single vendor because the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
technology is too

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,320
it's too new it's uh a lot of most of

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,199
the technologies we're talking about are

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,120
less than five years old and so um if

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,959
you're a central bank uh

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
you know you're not going to trust like

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,440
a young startup like that

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,040
um unless unless you have guarantees

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
that you know it's if you even if this

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,360
company goes away

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
the the core component is open and we

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
can

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,279
you know either take our own developers

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
and continue it or there's a community

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,040
around it and we can

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
continue with that so really it's about

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,360
um

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
you know many people creating these

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
building building blocks and then

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,959
allowing it to come together again it's

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
a composability

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,279
and it helps people to collaborate i'm

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,760
just to give an example um

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,120
uh i guess this couple years ago

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,079
hyperledger ursa

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,839
uh was you know was approved and uh it's

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,279
a cryptographic library it has many

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,600
different types of complex

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,040
cryptographic algorithms that have been

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
vetted by professionals

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,440
and and you know writing your own

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,639
cryptography is a terrible idea in any

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
project and so

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,480
um every every blockchain project

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,519
typically you know

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,480
uses you know different libraries and

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,880
sometimes even the same implementation

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,399
or

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,199
sorry different implementations of the

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,680
same spec um can have minor differences

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,079
on some edge cases and this makes it

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,519
really hard especially in blockchain

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
because you have you have to get

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,440
consensus about some data

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,279
makes it really hard to get the exact

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,959
same answer on some edge cases and so

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
hyperledger ursa helps a lot with this

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,480
by standardizing

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,480
you know some of the key algorithms that

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,560
people use if you're just using you know

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
digital signature algorithm you have it

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,759
here in this library and you don't have

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,399
to worry about um

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
you know this who created this library

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,240
is it

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,320
you know can i can i trust it in my code

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,519
or should i write my own algorithm that

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,920
be crazy but

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,440
um so hyperledger ursa has been really

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,160
powerful and enabling

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
many uh blockchain projects out there

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,959
and i think

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,079
that's just one of you know dozens of

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,959
examples

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,160
of how at least in the blockchain space

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,120
open source has helped

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,240
significantly yeah yeah i think

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,839
sometimes

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,639
um you know it can be seen as uh

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,120
governments might see it as more risky

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
um

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
to not have something that they are in

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,680
control of or that's

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,800
uh you know they can uh you know put

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,079
their specific

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,839
requirements on um so it's definitely

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,039
something that i think

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,160
you know a lot of we hear that a lot of

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,720
banks are considering um both

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,439
kinds um and it'll be interesting

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,799
because

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,000
uh each cup each government is is

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,160
uh taking their own approach to it um

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,480
you know the the bank of information

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,799
system just came out with a report

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,240
um where uh the bank of england japan

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:34,720
uh sweden switzerland and in the us

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,679
as well um talked about um

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
you know what are the core requirements

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,840
um

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,280
that that need to to be there for an

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,799
effective central bank of

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,720
digital currency not just for the

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,960
domestic use but also to facilitate

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,960
cross-border payment use

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,760
um but you know it's still kind of up to

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
those different uh banks to choose

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
whether or not they're going to be doing

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,360
something

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,760
um in-house homemade proprietary

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,880
with the vendor or or something where

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,960
they're leveraging

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
open source with you know maybe even the

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,400
help of um

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
some service provider to help them build

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
it

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,520
um i think the the debate is

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,640
is still going on about what is uh

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:25,280
uh more stable what's more sure

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:29,440
what's more um uh or less risky

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,160
because um there's real conservatism

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,360
uh in central banks that you know they

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,559
can't

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,160
you know you can't mess up um you know

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,760
it has to be something that they feel

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:46,000
very very very very sure is stable

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,960
and confident in yeah so the

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,559
that's a good point is as well um but um

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,320
it's it's also important to remember

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
that technology is just one part of a

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,280
larger

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
larger picture and the technology

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
changes very fast

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
um so the yeah the report you're

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
referencing from the bank for

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,039
international

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,559
settlements um i think was a really key

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,360
report it came out in um

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,880
in october and uh and had seven central

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,039
banks including bank of japan

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
uh as members of it but it's very

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,840
interesting

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,039
research report because it laid out kind

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
of what are the

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,600
um what are the desert duration or what

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,280
are the desired features of different

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,880
cdc dbc's

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,400
cbd seats um and uh and but most of it

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,200
was really about you know things like

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,679
monetary policies so none of these uh

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,960
you know

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,799
uh tokenized fiat currencies should uh

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
you know of course change

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,640
monetary policy or provide systemic

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,320
risks

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,320
as far as technology goes they were

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,520
mainly concerned about things like

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,480
you know uh is it uh is it going to run

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,400
24 7

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,320
or is it going to be able to make some

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,360
kind of offline transactions that

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,520
perhaps you know some limitations and uh

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,480
and things like this and of course cost

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,280
as well because

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,080
um you know uh if you have infinite

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,720
money you can do

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
almost anything but um uh that doesn't

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,240
mean that

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,600
uh you know it's that you wouldn't have

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,280
users if the cost

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,960
was too high and so they're really

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,520
thinking about you know how do we create

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
um

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,720
like a simple form of digital cash um

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,760
which is

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,000
a big trend um but um

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
yeah i would i don't think the report

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,080
emphasized the technology enough of

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,080
course i'm a technologist

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,640
but i i do think that open technologies

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,440
help a lot some central banks don't like

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
openness

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,120
that much because they're worried about

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,240
security and this is you know of course

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,480
security by obscurity um

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,520
so it doesn't make sense to just try to

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
um

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
uh you know hide things you should have

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,679
like real mathematically proven security

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,120
in your system

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,679
um but uh but i do think a good argument

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
against

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
uh focusing on technology too much of

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,400
these systems is that

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,799
it the technology honestly does change a

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
lot

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,720
um and that's for having different

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,960
standards for messaging and

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,640
interoperability between systems so like

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
interledger protocols the stuff

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,480
uh the stuff we've been focusing on um

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
as well um

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
is really key and that also goes with

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,799
the international payments as well

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,280
right right well let's get let's get

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,919
into um some of the more specifics of

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,080
what

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,280
um you've been doing at suramitsu

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,320
specifically with the bank of cambodia

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,280
um and the project bakung

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
which just officially launched um in

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,520
october

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,880
it's been in operation for a year or so

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,360
now at least

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,280
um in in a semi official launch

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,960
um but officially last month which is

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,159
very very exciting

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,720
um and so please share a little bit more

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,760
about

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,799
how that project you know started off

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,480
and where

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,320
um what you've been building the last

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,440
couple years leading up to this

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,520
official launch yeah so

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,559
uh project in cambodia is a

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,159
is a you know real-time um

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,919
payment system that anyone in the

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,200
country can use just with their mobile

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,720
phone which is kind of a really

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
interesting

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,440
use case most central banks haven't

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,480
really ventured too much into this

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,120
space before i think probably easy way

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,440
to

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,320
explain is actually to show it because i

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,960
do have it on

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,000
the app on my phone um here i'll just

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,039
share my

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,559
screen real quick yeah that'd be great

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,240
technology is driving us crazy but um

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,679
you should be able to see my screen now

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,600
so um

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,360
uh what you see here is just the wallet

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,159
screen so it's very simple

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,440
digital wallet this is a white label app

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,720
that the central bank

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,640
um you know provides to commercial banks

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
my there's a commercial bank here at the

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
top foreign trade bank of cambodia

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
and then there's some balance like in my

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,200
real and us dollar

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,520
and it's really simple you can send and

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,039
receive money using qr codes

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,440
anyone can scan this and send me money

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,400
and then you can also send for example

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,679
uh some

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,320
uh some money here i'll send a two cents

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,000
i'm feeling

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,039
i'm feeling generous um uh hit

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,720
send confirm and then um

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,559
you can just hit send and then you get

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,240
you know you receive the the payments

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,720
some details here and then

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,679
um actually it's already done so it says

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
success here

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,799
on the screen so people this image of

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,720
like blockchain being a slow thing for

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,240
payments a lot of that is because you

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,880
know bitcoin takes you know

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,400
10 minutes or oh geez in the worst case

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,440
sometimes you you're waiting like 40

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,559
minutes or an hour

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,440
right um for your block to get mined and

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,120
um but but because this is using a

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,799
permission blockchain technology

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,880
it's you know much faster and so it's

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,600
just a two to three seconds

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
and um and and that's that's from the

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,960
whole stack like from

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,279
you know my phone to the commercial bank

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,320
to the um to the central bank and then

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,320
back to my phone so

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,120
it's really it's doing quite a lot um

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
in in that two to three seconds um but

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,120
um

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
uh any anyway so the this is the uh the

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,600
simple overview of the app i don't want

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,320
to spend uh

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,880
too much time showing it off but um the

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
cool

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
thing about this is uh anyone in the

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,159
country with the cambodian phone number

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,960
can send and receive

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,720
digital money now and um this digital

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
money is actually you know the ledger's

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
being

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,240
managed by the central bank which is

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
really really cool

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,960
concept it means that under the right

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,039
circumstances in the future

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,600
this could be you know it can can enable

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,679
open banking like you discussed where

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,279
through api access you could you could

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,000
have digital money in your application

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,120
in a safe

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
and secure way which is very a very very

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,919
cool

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,640
thing um but but yeah i don't want to

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,080
to talk forever about my own and using

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,360
it doesn't cost anything

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,200
for just to send this

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,440
um well i mean that's that's really up

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,159
to the banks uh currently because it's a

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,960
new system

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,279
uh there's no transaction fees involved

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,799
but

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,360
um you know that like it's not up to us

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,400
it's up to central banking commercial

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,799
banks

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,520
now we worked uh just to tell the story

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,440
real quick

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,360
um of this so the the central bank of

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,480
cambodia actually um

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,320
i guess from 2016 they were studying uh

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,760
you know cbdc's and blockchain and

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,679
different things like that

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,480
um and they approached us and then uh

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,559
from 2017 we worked on this so it took

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
took a couple years uh and then we

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,440
released the first

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,080
pilot in july of 2019 and then

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
uh is officially launched last month um

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,279
unfortunately

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,240
um i wasn't able to be there in person

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,000
because of uh

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,840
uh you know the current you know

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,520
pandemic and it's

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:59,360
very hard times to travel unfortunately

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,360
um but uh yeah i i think nbc

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
uh central bank of cambodia should

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,720
really be um

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
you know uh congratulated because they

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
had quite a lot of foresight

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,919
um for looking at this and uh and our

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,440
engineers worked with their their

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,600
engineers and their team

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,799
um you know to realize this system so

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,919
it's really very

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,320
um it's really very technocratic

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,120
uh public private uh type of partnership

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,279
and um

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,200
i i think it is very successful and it

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,039
was based uh you know around open source

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,720
technologies like hyperledgery doha

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,520
which is the uh the blockchain that we

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,120
use

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,240
right and um and how did the project

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
evolve so when they

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,320
when you started working on this with

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,120
them in 2016 um

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,960
is it is it the same thing that is now

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,600
like did it first start off as you know

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,240
let's just

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,919
digitize payments and and then it became

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,559
something else or what was sort of the

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,799
evolution of the project

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,799
well it's it's hasn't really changed all

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,279
that much uh they had a very clear

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,679
vision

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,799
i think from the beginning which was uh

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,840
that they want to have

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,320
um you know a retail uh accessible

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,120
payment system because uh there is very

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,320
high unbanked proportion in the country

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,760
and and you know things like credit

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,000
cards are very rare

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,440
in cambodia so it's hard to have a

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,880
digital economy without

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,880
robust digital payments and i think

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,039
they had the strategic vision and they

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
saw the opportunity and they took it

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,720
which is very

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,440
um right you know very forward thinking

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,480
yeah

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,880
absolutely i mean it's uh

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
from what i understand the only

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,600
officially launched

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,039
uh cbdc other than the project

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,559
sand dollar um out of the

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,559
bahamas these are the two that are

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:51,919
live and available to all citizens

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,480
um is is it exactly a cbdc or is it a

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,559
little bit

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,960
different than what the project sand

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,919
dollar is doing or the bank of england

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,279
and bank of france is considering um

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,799
just so that

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,720
the audience can understand the

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,600
particularities of what's similar or

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
different about what

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,880
what else they're hearing out there um

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,039
yeah i think

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,320
uh the system is very similar to project

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,399
sand dollar uh

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,760
in technical architecture it's also

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,120
similar to what

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,919
people's bank of china has which is a

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,880
it's a two-tier system in for example in

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,120
china where

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,039
any and in cambodia where you have a

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,640
central bank running the master ledger

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,760
and then all the consumers are

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,399
intermediated by um by commercial banks

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
who who manage the customers and onboard

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,080
customers do kyc

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,520
aml you know all the traditional things

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,600
and then uh and and then you know the

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,559
the mobile apps connect uh to the

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,880
central bank

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,480
through the um uh the commercial banks

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,000
so it's kind of a it's two-tier

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,399
architecture that's

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,279
actually fairly proven and scalable um i

00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,760
think it's a very

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,279
you know reasonable approach um the only

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,000
other architecture i would say that's

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,480
viable

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
is to do um to do something a little bit

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,919
more decentralized where you would have

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
for example instead of the central bank

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,120
running the whole ledger maybe have

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,279
commercial banks joining in on

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,240
validation of transactions and things

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,919
like that so

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
i'm not familiar with any central banks

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,640
doing that

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,320
but i do know that over the years

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,120
there's been proposals like that and

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,000
there's been

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,320
lots of experiments there's quite a lot

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,080
of

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,480
very interesting experiments going on in

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,559
the world but um to actually pull the

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,840
trigger and make these things live um

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,559
you know takes

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
um it takes a little bit it's not just

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,919
the technological thing it's also

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,799
you know there's politics there's you

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,399
know other types of regulatory issues

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,080
yeah and that was something i wanted to

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,080
ask is you know

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,840
did the government of cambodia create

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,520
new regulations or change their

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,600
regulations in order to make this

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,600
project possible

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,840
well they didn't uh need to change too

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,880
much so um this is really just

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,360
uh there's no changes in monetary policy

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,399
because it's very strictly um 100

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,120
reserved uh

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,000
fiat so it's kind of like just a stable

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
coin or

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,760
you know kind of it's very similar to

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
traditional payment systems that already

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,279
exist

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
and so central bank um is allowed to to

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,440
build payment systems and that's their

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
job

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,559
um and so they did that uh one thing

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,360
that needed to be

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,279
uh kind of approved by the regular

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,760
regulatory side was

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,559
this it's there's a two tier for uh

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,520
onboarding

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,000
uh users so um anyone with a phone

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,799
number

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,159
can sign up and and use the system and

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,080
you get a daily limit

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,600
so you have very small limit of

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,960
transactions you can use it

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,600
for buying you know some food or

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,840
something but you can't buy a car

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,200
but if you wanted to have higher value

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,480
transactions you actually have to

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,520
physically go to the bank

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,000
and do you know to kyc and onboard and

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,360
then they the bank will set the limit so

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,360
they can actually do i think any

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,760
anything they want

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,279
okay so it's a two-tier system so

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,880
getting this lower tier

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,039
accepted had to be done by the

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,720
regulatory um the regulator

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,880
in the country um but uh

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,880
but yeah i mean it's it's fairly low

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,919
risk because low value transactions you

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,200
know are really

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,320
somewhat hard to use in important

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,320
crime and also

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,159
to get a phone number anyway in cambodia

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,399
you have to provide a passport scan

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,679
so there is it is you know it's not an

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,600
anonymous way to do

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,120
payments um because at the end of the

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,120
day

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,880
if a police agency or something wanted

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,519
to find out who made a transaction they

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,080
could do it

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,279
um there's way there's ways to find out

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
um

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,880
but but it does have clear separation of

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
data and who

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
who controls what so the central bank

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,120
doesn't really know the identity of

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,640
anyone

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,399
um doing anything because you know

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,919
that's done by the commercial banks

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,159
who who manage the customers and so

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,240
um i think that's it's always important

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,039
to have um

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,600
you know some uh some segregation

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,360
between

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,279
you know who can see what uh in this

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,320
system you don't want a single

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,600
entity um that that has like you know

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,919
god-like powers in any system like this

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,880
yeah absolutely and you know you

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,279
mentioned the

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,240
financial inclusion aspect you showed us

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,279
the um

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,799
the app and how it works um you know

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,440
could you share a little bit more about

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,960
what this

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,279
means for um you know

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,159
the average cambodian day-to-day you

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,760
know what does it

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,399
allow them to do that maybe they

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,559
couldn't do before

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,799
well i think it makes doing any kind of

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,200
digital payment a lot easier

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,880
it wasn't completely impossible before

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,559
uh but it was

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,919
pretty hard to do especially in the

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,760
real-time way like you couldn't um

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,600
you couldn't do something like you know

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,320
similar ui or ux to

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,559
credit card processing where you go to

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,399
the website you log in and you're done

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,480
it is a little bit harder involving some

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,760
sms's and things like that

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,320
um so that that that opens up a whole

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
new way

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,360
a whole new area of digital commerce

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
that didn't really exist

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,480
before so i think that's very exciting

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
um

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,880
uh other ways that it helps or i would

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,480
say

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,399
it helps kind of make all the

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,159
i don't know the the payment's a lot

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,840
faster and more efficient so up until

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,880
now a lot of people have used cash for

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,360
everything

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,720
and in cash you know you have to carry

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,519
it and do all these things and give

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,960
change and

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,720
it it takes time to do everything and um

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,320
especially now with the pandemic you

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,679
know people are worried about cash and

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,640
then

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,000
all these you know sanitary issues as uh

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,760
as well and so

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,960
um just the just the efficiency increase

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,760
in the payment space

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,840
if you know if the whole population use

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,039
this system it could easily add you know

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,360
one percent of gdp uh just by the

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,960
efficiency and payment right just you

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,840
know the time wasted and

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,000
you know giving change and going to the

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,320
back

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,399
it's it's quite it it adds up at the

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,440
scale of the economy and so

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,440
um it's this you know can can help

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,639
um just give more efficiency and in a

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,440
developing country that's

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,159
every little bit helps because it gives

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,240
people

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,359
you know if you can barely afford you

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,000
know food or

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,200
you know house you know just having a

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,480
little bit extra

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,440
can help quite a lot yeah no that's

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,639
that's um that's so true and it's it's

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,280
really exciting

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,159
um to see it'll be really exciting to

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,679
see

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,200
um you know what what we will begin to

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,560
hear from

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,480
cambodians using using this

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,200
this payment service um the impact of

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,040
of you know that efficiency of not

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,919
having to go to the bank of not having

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,920
to

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,359
take out cash or carry so much cash

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,240
there's security there too

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,560
right um not having to have so much cash

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,599
on your person

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,720
um uh i wanted to also

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,800
ask you um you know

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,560
uh oh and by the way i wanted to just

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,560
let our audience know

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,560
um if you want to learn even more about

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,760
this um

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,760
this case study actually we have um

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,520
a report a case study that we've

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,839
developed at hyperledger

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,520
on our website about project bacon so

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,880
that's another place that you can learn

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,119
more before we

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,800
um go into my next question where i was

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,359
just listening to this podcast where i

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,720
was

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,240
um it was coindesk money reimagined

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,079
and i was listening to the uh premiere

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,800
of bermuda

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,280
talk with the podcast hosts and saying

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
that

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,560
you know they were actually moving away

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,920
from

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,000
um building their own cbdc

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,359
and instead are investing in private

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,040
sector innovation

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,480
coming to bermuda um in order to

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,440
build uh stable coins um

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,800
and and other forms of digital payments

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,400
um

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,520
rather than spending resources on

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,119
building their own government

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,079
infrastructure which we talked about

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,920
earlier

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,240
you know is something that um you know

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,359
while working with open technologies can

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,599
seem risky

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,480
um it can also be very risky to kind of

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,480
build your own

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,240
with the technology that's changing so

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,359
quickly like you mentioned

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,520
um uh and part of the thing

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,480
one of the things that um the premier

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,680
mentioned in that

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,720
discussion was um you know having to

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
deal with that

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,480
changing technology and the vendor

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,760
lock-in and so

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,800
um you know for anyone who is

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,200
in government looking to use this why

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,359
um why does it benefit government to use

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,680
open source technologies for these kinds

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,599
of um

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,079
projects yeah so that's a great question

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,880
um and i think maybe it's overlooked by

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,359
a lot of

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,800
governments actually i know the podcast

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,920
you're talking about

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,280
with the premier david byrd and um um i

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,560
had the honor of meeting him

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,560
uh gee last year in davos

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,400
i met all three of the participants on

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,160
the podcast actually at the

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,000
at the gbc the global blockchain

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,040
business council yeah

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,240
that was uh last year um which is really

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,200
a great um

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,400
opportunity and um i actually spoke uh

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,880
yeah to premiere byrd

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,560
and uh one of his um uh one of his

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,040
technical advisors who's there

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,720
and uh quite a lot about their stable

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,320
coin regulation and also digital

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,119
identity regulation

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,680
um that he talked about but um yeah

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,320
they're

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
they're they're well you know bermuda's

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,520
a fairly

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,000
small market um and so uh they do have

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,640
uh perennial difficulties in getting

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
like new

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,480
um services to come in you know come

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,560
down there and step

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,760
shop just because there's there's so few

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,720
um

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,240
consumers that it's hard to justify from

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,880
a you know monetary standpoint

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,599
so uh they're they're targeting a lot of

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,000
um

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,839
kind of like supernational services so

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,200
things like stable coin issuance

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,119
uh where you know you can issue a stable

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,000
coin that's backed by us dollars that

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,480
are sitting in

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,920
bank vaults or you know on bank balance

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,560
sheets in bermuda

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,240
and then um and then use these stable

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,119
coins all over the world with with some

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,200
clear

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,560
regulatory clarity which is kind of a

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,400
really cool thing

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,440
um i think it's uh it's it's a good step

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,040
in the right direction i was a little

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,359
bit disappointed that they don't

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,640
support synthetic assets so they

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,920
actually do want you know fully

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,280
collateralized

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,380
you know uh stable coins uh which

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,200
which i think uh uh

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,480
[Music]

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,359
maybe is is not not the most interesting

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,079
uh thing to me personally but um but

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,240
yeah they

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,359
they wanted to not build their own

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,320
system or even

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,160
choose uh you know choose the winner um

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,000
for anything like digital identity or

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,720
with the stable coins because they

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640
wanted

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,640
different market participants to come in

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,880
sep shop there and then compete

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,720
and then have a clear and equal

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,880
regulatory playground which is kind of a

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,160
cool idea so their idea is like

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
instead of creating a bermuda and

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,760
digital identity you know

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,960
100 companies can come and set up their

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,200
own digital identity that's totally cool

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,400
um we'll treat these as you know the

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,480
ones we we

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,440
approve you know we'll treat these as a

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,040
legal form of

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,640
some kind of digital identity um in in

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,119
you know on the island um and um

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,400
and and so that's one way to do it uh so

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,000
you don't have any vendor lock-in

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,160
because you don't have any vendors

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,520
um you just uh you just let you know

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,800
anyone come in and kind of

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,400
shop with a regulatory framework um that

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,160
that works if you have something that

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
there's a clear market demand for like

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,920
stable coins

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,280
um or even or even digital identity

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,160
which you know you can use anywhere in

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,040
the world

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,720
um supposedly so these types of

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
applications make sense for something

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,599
like

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,400
a domestic payment system it's a little

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,599
bit harder

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,280
um to justify so like uh

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,800
you'd have to actually have a vendor

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,200
come in and actually make the

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,240
um sacrifice to actually pay pay the

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,960
money and set the

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,880
you know set up a system here in this

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,200
country which is not

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,440
not the biggest place in the world and

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,480
so um

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,040
yeah so so having everything open source

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,240
you know

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,640
allows maybe uh the government of a

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,839
small

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,839
nation like that to uh to be able to

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,920
maybe they could build their own system

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,599
even using these composable parts that

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,319
other companies have like for example

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,640
that we made

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,079
um and then made open source because

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,920
then you don't have to uh

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,680
to worry about you know having like a

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,560
license that you have to be buying

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,240
or um or some kind of proprietary system

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,079
that you're not sure what the uh

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,440
the quality is right right it's it's

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,079
um again kind of goes back to there's so

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,000
many different

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,079
approaches to this and and each

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,880
government is really taking

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,960
you know just just not too far away we

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,280
have project sand dollar out of bahamas

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,480
that's taken a very different approach

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,119
um so it's it's very interesting to see

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,760
what's being done uh or what and what

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,079
will

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,880
what will be coming out more and more um

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,280
we just heard

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,960
actually um there was news today that

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,079
the bank of australia is developing

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,280
something um with a couple of

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,920
vendors so um

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,040
it's not clear yet what technology

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,520
they're using

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,520
um uh seems like it may be something

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,040
ethereum based but will it be public

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,839
will it be permissioned

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,359
um you know that's uh that's for us to

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,560
continue to follow and

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,960
and find out as as central banks explore

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,680
the many different ways in which you can

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,880
go about digitizing your currency

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,359
um so um

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,880
before uh we wrap up here i wanted to

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,440
see you know what are some of the you

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,319
know

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,920
you are part of this this project

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,640
project one of the few

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,160
formerly officially launched cbdc's out

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,880
there what are some of the lessons

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,760
learned that you have in building the

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,240
technology

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,240
implementing it um working with

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,400
government that might be helpful

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,480
to anyone else who's exploring that

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,680
yeah so i think um one of the things

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,240
that really led to

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,280
uh the success of the project was um

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,319
being able to

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,440
um you know work directly with uh the

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,680
government and really have

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,880
uh the central bank being one of the

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,680
core stakeholders

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,599
so having that kind of um you know

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,160
buy-in from the team that actually has

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,200
to run

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,920
the system uh is very important um and i

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,400
don't think

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,920
you know we would just have been wasting

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,880
our time without having you know that

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,839
that very you know special support and

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,280
actually having them

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,880
work on it um so i think being able to

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,480
find the right stakeholders being able

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,359
to find people with the passion

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,839
and then a clear use case that also um

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,160
you know

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,960
is easily justifiable makes sense so in

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,520
cambodia

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,200
financial inclusion is a big problem and

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,400
this is a clear solution it's not just

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,240
about

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,760
using technology for the sake of the

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,160
technology

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,359
you want to use it to solve a real need

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,800
that people have

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,880
and if you do that then it's not really

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,640
you know the rest will kind of come into

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,480
place i think in many ways

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,200
um but i i i think it's really important

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,359
for small companies to not to be afraid

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:46,560
to try to do big challenges because they

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,760
you know technology uh is not evenly

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,160
distributed

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,599
a lot of small companies have really

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,440
state-of-the-art technology

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,680
that that sometimes no one else has and

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,800
that should be um that should be

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,680
appraised uh

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,240
and and you know you know understood by

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,200
the market

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,480
and different participants as well so uh

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,560
and never be afraid to

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,400
to make things open um uh

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,079
you know a lot of people said you know

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,599
why do we spend so much money and time

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,640
on open source

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,040
and uh and for us really

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,000
well part of it's just my own philosophy

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,680
and i really like

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,200
for example what you know tesla did with

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,359
making their patents open

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,359
um and things like that are you know

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,000
giving you lessons for that and

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,480
um really you know life is really short

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,960
and

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,200
and you don't want to waste time so it's

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,920
really important to be able to

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,280
to have others reuse some of the effort

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,800
that you've done

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,480
and even contribute back to it and uh

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,240
it's that collaboration i think that

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,800
really makes

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,520
you know life worth living and uh

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,520
without

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,119
without that collaboration you're just

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,040
you know fighting the whole world

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,560
always and that's not a very fun thing

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,280
to do right

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,640
and you know we are here at a linux

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,400
foundation event

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,040
and um you know our um

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,720
the the dlts that we work with are part

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,680
of the linux foundation i think that's

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,040
been part of the

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,119
the history of um of

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,319
you know open source technology is that

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,520
it it it

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,720
fosters um and

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,760
really builds innovation and allows um

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,560
that progress to happen in a way that's

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,200
um much more accelerated i think that's

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,240
been

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,400
um you know stated over and over

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,240
that um you know the innovation

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,520
accelerates when people have

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,280
more um access to how things are done

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,839
and can kind of look under the hood and

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,160
then see okay this is what you know i

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,000
could

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,440
i could now take this and and improve

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,640
upon it um

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,760
and it just you know really accelerates

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,880
from there in a way that

00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,240
probably or you know really

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,839
can't i think um uh in a way where

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,760
you've only got you know

00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,079
a few eyes looking at it you know rather

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,640
than uh the world's

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,839
view on it yeah it increases security

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,720
quite a lot too and that's something i

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,280
didn't touch on

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,319
uh but uh i don't think that could be um

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,440
you know overstated

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,280
either that uh having

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,440
you know for systemically important

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,319
infrastructure you want the core part to

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,200
be open source

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,240
it's my my personal opinion right well

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,880
you know

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,599
trust transparency and security is the

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,640
promise

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,440
of digital currencies um

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,560
you know there's different concerns that

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,839
different people have

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,599
for that uh security

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,839
and that transparency some people don't

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,000
want governments being able to

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,359
see who they are and how they're

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,800
spending their money

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,240
um uh startups and financial

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,920
institutions

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,440
have had major issues with um security

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,640
uh breaches

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,200
and transparency as well so um

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,000
just to wrap up our discussion here what

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,200
is

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,319
the outlook um what's next for project

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,720
bakung

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,599
and also you know what do you sort of

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,200
see

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:18,560
um are you excited about in in in the d5

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,240
cbdc uh peer-to-peer payment space

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:25,119
oh okay yeah so um so for back home

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,760
um yeah just uh to further you know

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,240
expand

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,599
increase users there's some usability

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,640
increases that can be done

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,200
by making you know specific applications

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,200
for businesses and payment terminals and

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,599
even integration with card networks

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,720
these are all things that

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,920
i'm very excited on over the next year

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,520
um so that's uh should be fun

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,880
uh for in the defy space uh i didn't

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,000
talk too much about it but we're doing

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,319
some really cool stuff

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,359
we're working on uh we got a grant for

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,240
dex in

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,839
a decentralized exchange in uh the polka

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,359
dot ecosystem that's called

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:06,800
focus swap um so that's actually

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:09,839
um in the future we're hoping to use

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,559
hyper luxury roha version 2 um

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,079
as part of that ecosystem so that's uh

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,680
that's really exciting

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,280
um project that we're doing um

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,359
other than that yeah we're also doing

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,040
some i would say pretty cool experiments

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,319
with like a decentralized economic

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,400
system called sora

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,839
and uh and different things so we we

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,880
make quite a lot of open source

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,280
applications

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,200
as well so before or besides just a

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,800
hyper ledger project we also contribute

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,400
uh you know to other types of open

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,040
source so we're working with web3

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,640
foundation

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,920
and also protocol labs on filecoin

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,960
um so we we're doing some cool things

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,880
it's my dream that many of these pieces

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,280
and ideas can kind of come together

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,119
and uh as part of this we're working on

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,599
hyper luxury ohio too which is kind of

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,520
taking

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,720
taking some of the things that we've

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,800
learned

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,079
and you know improving on them you know

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,160
creating new ideas

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,440
and um i think heater hot tubes can be

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,880
very very

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,160
well the philosophy is very different

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,040
it's going to be really hard to compare

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,640
it to other

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:13,760
um systems uh when we're done

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,920
um that's it's going to be a fun year uh

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,359
over the hopefully um hopefully next

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,480
year it's going to be better than

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:24,319
2020 um yeah hard to be worse but i mean

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,079
i think we all i think we all hope for

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:29,359
that

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,520
um yeah so yeah i think i'm really

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,280
excited about being in the space and the

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,760
technology is in a good place i think

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
there's nothing short to read about in

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,319
the on this topic

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,680
um and uh i'll be sure to

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,680

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,559
referenced in the chat

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,240
here during the event um the case study

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,079
on project bakung

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,319
