hi this is your host supreme bhartiya on

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
behalf of the linux foundation and today

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,599
we have with us two guests a festival

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,240
regular shilly goodman executive

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,679
director of

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,080
lf energy and lucian balia r d

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,279
program director and open source manager

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,279
at rte

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,880
shilli uchiyan first of all welcome to

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,720
the show

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,960
thank you so much it's really good to be

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
back thank you it's a pleasure

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
shelley we have talked to each other you

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,160
know everybody knows you but

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,599
uh lucha and we are talking for the

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,840
first time so can you first of all tell

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,800
us

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,760
a bit about rte uh what do you guys

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,920
folks do and

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
uh what is your engagement with lf

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,719
energy project yes of course

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,280
so rt is a french power transmission

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,399
system operator

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
i guess we are quite unusual player

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,719
in the open source landscape so our

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
experience with open source is quite

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,520
recent

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,000
and in fact

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,199
three years ago rt decided to embrace

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,840
open source to

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:09,200
accelerate our digitalization strategy

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,080
and moving towards open source

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
we asked ourselves about the proper

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,920
governance

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,960
framework to foster open source

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,720
collaborations

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,400
and at that time we had the opportunity

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
to to meet julie and

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,680
julie um was working with the linux

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,040
foundation

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
and on her side she wanted to set up an

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
ambitious

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,280
initiative dedicated to the energy

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,759
sector and the energy transition so then

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
our interests match very well and we

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
started

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
this successful collaboration to build

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
left energy so

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,720
and i understand that i'm very proud to

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,040
see how lf energy has grown

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
uh today thanks for sharing the story

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
and uh also how you uh

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
truly played a critical role in bringing

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,720
you on board now actually let's uh

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
hand over the virtual mic to you uh

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
today we're going to talk about c

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,520
path project can you tell us a bit about

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
the project itself what is it all about

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
well i think that one of the most

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,759
important things about the transition

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
that we're making

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
with regards to energy is uh to

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
virtualization

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
and to software-defined infrastructure

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,840
and so

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,239
this is precisely what uh luchem and the

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,840
team are going after with cpath

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,959
is is to create a kind of a

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
first offering a first approach towards

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,640
open source

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,160
and the virtualization of substations

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
lucian i want to know

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
from you uh of course you know you are

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,440
part of lf energy but

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
uh from your perspective from rt's

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,599
perspective

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
how do you see the cpath project also

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
actually was talking that you know we

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
are everything is becoming software

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
defined everything is kind of becoming

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,959
virtual

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
so talk about the project from your

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,440
perspective and this transition that she

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
talked about

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,360
yeah so um power systems power grids

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,959
are complex systems you have all the

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
loads the generators

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,480
the grid equipment that interact in real

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
time

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,879
and to operate

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
safely power grids you you need to act

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,480
on levels

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,720
uh to face uh to handle some hazards

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,680
continuous hazards such as outages

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,159
fluctuations

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,000
in consumption or production and for

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,800
that so today we have

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
uh two kind of levels human activated

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
levels

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,879
and and automated levels and

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
with the energy transition and the fact

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
that we are

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,319
moving to a more complex system with

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,599
more distributed

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,360
players distributed

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,360
variation sources and but also

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,200
distributed levels to control the grid

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,319
we want to we need to rethink about

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,480
our grid control architecture and we

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,680
want to unlock the capability to

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,519
innovate

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,000
to bring advanced and adaptative

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,760
automation functions at the edge of the

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
grid so when i talked about the edge of

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
the grid

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,720
it's uh the power grid substations in

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,120
fact

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,159
and to unlock this innovation

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,199
and meet our challenges we see

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,680
two key concepts for that and

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
these are inspired by the telecom

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,000
industry

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
in fact so those two key concepts are

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,040
virtualization

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
and cross-industry open source

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
collaboration

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,120
um so i can develop if you want to the

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,320
benefits from

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
virtualization and open source if that

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
makes

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,199
make sense yeah it does so so

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
for instance so first of all

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,199
virtualization

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,919
um of course it's

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,639
easier to deploy upgrade operate

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,440
software than hardware so following the

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
path

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
of the telecom industry we expect that

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,039
virtualization will

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,759
unlock innovation will help us to

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,720
accelerate but also to reduce deployment

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
operation and

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,039
maintenance costs

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
but then in the end we don't want to end

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,600
with

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
several virtualization platforms that

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
would be

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,680
vendor-specific virtualization platforms

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,240
deployed on the field so we need a

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,080
cross-industry uh collaboration

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,120
and this is uh what open source brings

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,039
so it's it brings first of all the

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
open source through the leverage

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
different mode

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,960
leverage development model will help us

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,080
to

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,520
get the solution in a timely and cost

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,479
effective manner

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
but also it will facilitate

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
cross-industry

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,000
collaboration and on this topic we have

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
at the crossroads

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of i.t and operational

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,520
technology and so in terms of

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
competencies

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
mixing competencies from

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,720
all the parts of the industry will be

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
essential to achieve

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
our goals if you can talk a bit about

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,440
number one

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,039
is how do you see these projects at lf

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,520
energy number two is that

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,120
you did talk about the benefits of going

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,440
software defined is easier than

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
hardware and virtual also but at the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,919
same time

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,199
when we look at all this project it also

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,639
kind of open

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,880
up the space for others players so that

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,600
you are not investing all your research

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,360
resources r d uh i mean the energy

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,440
sector a lot of players are there

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,120
which are your in some cases i mean this

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
is not a very competitive market but

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
still

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,560
how does it help to bring these projects

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,560
under the umbrella of lf energy

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
which kind of leads to cross-validation

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,199
but also a lot of collaboration

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,639
yeah so indeed i i think that

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,680
um well speaking frankly

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,880
frankly uh the cpas project is a

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,080
disruptive uh from our

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
let's say ecosystem

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,960
we have vendors that are used

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,800
to build devices and to sell devices

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,960
and i guess it's not easy to um

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,199
to make a shift to virtualization so

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
becoming a software company and not only

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,960
that but uh

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
playing in a in a software in an open

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,639
source

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,240
context so this is

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,800
really disruptive but

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,520
we knew we looked at the example of the

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
telecommunications

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,120
industry where players

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,400
actors such as at t managed to transform

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,039
their

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,440
ecosystem through open source

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,479
collaborations such as the honor project

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,280
that developed some of the

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
virtualization stack that is currently

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
used

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,800
to to run the 5g

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,800
networks and

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,319
this convinces us that transformation

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,680
is is feasible is feasible is achievable

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,560
but um so

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,919
first of all um rt is a quite modest

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,360
player even compared to

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,720
a tnt we are a smaller company so in

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,599
order to

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
to shift the ecosystem we need to be

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,760
credible

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,719
so we need to to partner that's why we

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,200
partner with lf energy because it

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:44,640
gives us credibility visibility

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,360
it offers a governance framework

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,560
that is attractive for collaborations

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
and

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
this is um we believe that this is the

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,880
only way to

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
to grow the community to to reach the

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,240
critical mass that

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
will uh allow to make this this

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,760
transformation

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,720
uh and um i guess that we will enter

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,440
into a

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,000
virtual circle where uh the community

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,480
will grow

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,760
this will convince the industry that

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,600
this is the future

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,600
it happened in the telecommunications

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,160
and and um and for us um

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,959
as an end consumer it it's essential to

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,720
um

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,839
to achieve these goals because um

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
this is a way to

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
to meet the challenges of the energy

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
transition

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
and the development of renewables in a

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,200
cost efficient manner

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
um to get all the innovation that we

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,160
will need to

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,000
deliver um a good

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,080
service to our consumers to the

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
energy consumers since you're comparing

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,760
with the

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,600
telcos and one uh telcos one transition

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,399
that they went through was also they

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
moved away from a lot of propriety black

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,959
boxes to

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,560
a lot of white box commodity hardware uh

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,560
can you talk about what is since you

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
earlier mentioned that hardware is

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
difficult

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
than software so can you talk about is

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
there something similar going with the

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
hardware part

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
of in the energy sector as well where

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
you are moving

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,040
away from a lot of proprietary boxes

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,200
towards the white boxes or

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,120
you know maybe open source or commodity

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
hardware as well so that's the vision so

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
today

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,519
um in a power substation

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
we have devices that perform some

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,720
automation functions

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,120
and even some very fast automation

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,920
function that we call protection so

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
for instance these protections ensure

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
that in case of

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,079
short circuits or if lightning strikes a

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
power

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,959
line that we open the circuits

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,480
uh very fast so that we don't endanger

00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,720
people or we don't damage equipment

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,760
and the vision is um so currently it's

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,320
quite difficult to innovate in that

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,519
field because you you have to go

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,560
on the field to replace equipment

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,079
etc so with um

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
with cpas we want to to move to a new

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,279
world where

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,640
those functions will be deployed as

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,760
software

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,880
on uh quite generic hardware

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:32,399
in the substations and um that

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,440
will um open

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,160
a lot of possibilities in terms of

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,120
uh new new software new innovation that

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,959
will be

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,880
deployed at the edge of of power grids

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,240
what kind of road map you have for lf

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
energy for 2021

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
well we have three projects that we're

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,519
launching in the next week

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,000
which is really quite extraordinary we

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
have

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,880
a microgrid project hyphy um

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,360
that is launching uh next week

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
we're doing a global pressure release a

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
fledge power

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,760
which is a uh you know it's a

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,760
kind of it's it's a power system take on

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,120
industrial iot

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,399
and then the third project that we are

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
launching is suangyo which is

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,200
at the distribution level um are the

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,560
software um for a calculation state

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,279
estimation

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,160
um that are really the beginning of the

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,600
transition

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,720
from uh these hard scada systems

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,079
into really being able to bring

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,399
industrial iot into the you know the

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,800
power system network operations

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,720
because they're going to be so necessary

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,399
for being able to orchestrate

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,000
and choreograph the networks in much the

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,959
same way that we think about

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
choreographing the networks of you know

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,360
the internet

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,639
or telecommunications it's a very simple

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399
and uh you know within energy uh

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
you know it's it's really about

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,279
balancing supply and demand

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
and the new paradigm when you begin to

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
bring

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,279
renewable and variable energy in is that

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
in order to manage those peak times

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,839
we have to be able to choreograph how we

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,920
are in relationships so all of our

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,399
projects are in that direction

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,279
we have a series of microgrid projects

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,320
that are supposed to

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,320
start coming in q2 from australia

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
really trying to bring on uh an open

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,199
source data platform

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
and uh we're in advanced conversations

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,519
around that

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,680
um so i often describe and feel like i

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
we've got like you know 100 plates

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,600
spinning

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,639
at the same time because you know we're

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
really

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,360
i i see that between now and november

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,399
when cop26 happens

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,760
in scotland that um that the world is

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
really looking for

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
places for being able to collaborate at

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
scale

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
decarbonization of our economies is

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,240
going to be

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,959
complicated and intense power systems

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,480
leads that

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,800
so the projects that we're really

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,639
focusing on right now are really

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,639
directed towards power system

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
transformation

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,680
and that's the software it's you know if

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
you have software

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,519
uh reach out to me because what we want

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,920
is to create an ecosystem in a community

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,519
of utilities and vendors and suppliers

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,040
that are building this

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,000
uh system together it is the largest

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,480
uh networked system on the planet it is

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,199
it's

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:46,000
it's like a massive mycelium network

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,880
underneath our planet which is really

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
all about

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,040
energy and how we manage energy and

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
power

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,680
awesome lucian actually thanks for

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
taking time out today and talk about not

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
only this project but also the whole

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
evolution that is going on which is

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,560
software driven open source driven and

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,839
it's virtual and i look forward to talk

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,639
to you again actually as you said a lot

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,920
of projects are

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
already in the pipeline so we'll be

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
seeing each other a lot thank you

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
i hope so thank you swapnow for

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:18,639
everything i appreciate it thank you

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,639
