	00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,920
today we have with us once again

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,600
shelly goodman founder and executive

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,960
director of lf energy it's an

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,000
organization it's a part of linux

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
foundation

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
that focuses on open source innovation

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
in the energy and electric

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,520
sector surely first of all uh welcome to

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,439
the show once again

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
thank you so much it's great to be back

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,279
talking with you when we look at

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,320
power lines or when we look at grids we

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
still have

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
the image of that ancient you know

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,400
system all it does it

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,920
moves and elect you know electrons

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
protons whatever they are from one place

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,880
to other place

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
what innovation is going on because if

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
you look at the energy

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160
consumption today it's massive it's

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
going to keep growing more and more as

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,239
we move

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
more towards work from home kind of

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,840
environment when we have vr and they are

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,000
so it is are we still talking about the

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,120
old dumb power lines and all downgrade

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,120
or we are also talking about

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,039
modern infrastructure and if we do what

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,920
does it look like well we're definitely

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,079
talking about modern infrastructure

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,079
you know one of the things that

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,159
one of the defining features of the grid

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,960
that we're moving from

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
is you have centralized energy

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
generation

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,680
that is being pushed out over high

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,320
voltage to distribution systems

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
we lose nearly sixty percent of the

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,960
packets uh

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,600
sixty percent of the electrons um

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,720
that's sixty percent of our electrons

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
are lost

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,439
from generation to distribution so

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,720
there's a tremendous opportunity

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,360
for optimization and being able to

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,920
reduce the amount of electron loss

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,400
when you consider what the opportunities

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,320
are the

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
there's tremendous opportunities for

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,960
optimization

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,240
and the digitalization of energy

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,119
in terms of the metadata and the data

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,520
that about energy that enables

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
you know system operators to be able to

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,920
work much more

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,640
effectively is going to be critical

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,880
in ensuring that we actually are able to

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
balance supply and demand in a different

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
way

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,360
than we've been balancing supply and

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,120
demand for the last 150 years

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
you guys are great at bringing all those

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
players who have those innovative ideas

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
together so they can collaborate on them

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
so talk a bit about the work that is

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
going on

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
to address some of these problems that

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
you mentioned well you know i

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,959
i say to people a lot that i that i ask

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,520
them to actually think ahead

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
30 years to the year 2050 and even

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
imagine how old you are

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
um in 30 years from now because you're

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
going to be looking back

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
at this time in a very different sort of

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
way we're at the beginning of a period

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,040
of accelerated innovation

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
and that all of these things we are

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,480
going to have to address them

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,239
what the digital substation project is

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,360
really beginning to address is the

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
ability to have

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
torrents of data being managed from the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,879
edge

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
and to be able to provide grid

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,720
intelligence out at the edge

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,000
and have a mechanism for being able to

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
bring that in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
and then to be able to orchestrate

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,239
choreograph

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,400
and and to even have kind of control or

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
share control mechanisms

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,720
that you know that enable us to manage

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
the grid so the kinds of innovations

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
you know what i feel like that what

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
we're working on now

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,200
is blocking and tackling at a very

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,640
fundamental level both building capacity

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,280
amongst um the network carriers

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
it could you know you have utilities who

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
have always thought of themselves as

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,720
kind of like

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,440
hardware guys lines you know it's been a

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,040
very

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,680
uh manual highly intensive um

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,080
you know industry and what we're going

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
to be

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,680
actually moving more towards is

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,599
network operators um you know almost

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,599
carriers you know kind of an

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,959
amalgam of of uh you know electricity

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,159
uh telecommunications um you know

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,519
and and internet and and so you

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,760
are going to have this whole new uh

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
process of being able to orchestrate

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,080
energy and

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,840
digitalization is essential in that

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,239
paradigm it could even be up to 50

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,400
of that um and then there's other stuff

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,639
that's happening both at the chip level

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,080
and at the hardware level um that is

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,160
going to enable that kind of

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
intelligence at the edge and the ability

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
to choreograph that

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
through market signals you know what

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,120
we're doing is shifting to

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,680
a price based grid coordination model in

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,160
other words the price signals

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
that will shift and change based on the

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,400
amount of sun or the amount of wind or

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
the availability of energy

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,240
will actually begin you know getting

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
pushed out to the edge

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,520
and enable coordination between

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
assets at the edge uh can you also tell

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
us just a bit about how

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
exactly does dsas or substation

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,240
automatism works

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,160
well i think that so for those of you

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,880
who are listening who've been along

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
the journey with lf networking um or

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
have kind of seen what's happened with

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,919
5g

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
the revolution of 5g was the

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,120
virtualization and the disaggregation

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
the shift from you know purely hardware

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
centric

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,560
um to really moving to 75 virtualization

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
so the digital substation or the dsas

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
project

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
is an umbrella of four different

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,639
projects that are addressing

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,280
uh the digitalization at the

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,120
substation and the substation are the

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,680
are the critical infrastructure

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
that separates high medium and low

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
voltage

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,600
between you know the generation and then

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,759
moving it and then stepping it down

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,759
before it then goes out into your house

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
and so substations become really

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,880
important

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,880
i refer to them as edge node routers and

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,160
you know which may or may not be exactly

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,160
the right term but

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
you know we're moving into a territory

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,199
where we're inventing things

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,479
so i think of the edge node and the dsas

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
project is

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,880
is really about virtualizing uh hardware

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
abstracting the complexity of hardware

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,960
and software

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
so that we begin to have really

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,560
software-defined

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,560
environments and you know and perhaps in

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,319
the future we'll have

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,479
increasingly software-defined

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,560
substations transformers

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,960
all kinds of things that we consider to

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,759
be de facto the standard today

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,039
may in fact move more and more towards

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,160
software defined

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
and the dsas project is really the start

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
of that

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
what kind of collaboration is there

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,960
around dcs it's a great project

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,240
we have it was really started with rte

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,800
and rte may last summer

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
we made a series of meetings where we

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
invited people

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,840
uh to come and talk with us and we

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,319
opened it up to all of the oems vendors

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,759
suppliers

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,759
such as you know ge

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,680
abb schneider electric and to

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,960
all the network operators utilities

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,720
all over the world that wanted to

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,000
participate and what we have

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,800
is a core group from rte

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
france and then we have aleander and

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
tenet which are the

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,800
distribution and the transmission system

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,599
operators in the netherlands

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,960
tenet also operates in germany national

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,360
grid

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,880
and then we have general electric is

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,479
really driving it

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,560
from a kind of vendor oem perspective

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,560
and then schneider electric is also

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,520
participating and we hope that others

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,479
will join us

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,800
now you also uh have something called

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,960
compass or or configuration modules for

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,599
power industry automation system

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
what is that so compass is the first of

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,800
the four

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
projects i it's three or four projects

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,520
that's in the dsas

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,560
kind of umbrella and uh so compass is

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
the first one

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,120
and it's really a configuration model

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,520
one of the one of the problems that

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,919
end users have that the utilities have

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,120
when they think about

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,319
uh kind of um

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,800
their portfolio of hardware and software

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,319
is that right now there are tremendous

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,440
interoperability challenges now 61 850

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,599
which is an iec standard was created

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,039
precisely in order to facilitate

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:38,560
interoperability so how we look at this

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,240
is that the compass project is

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,680
leveraging 61 850 to enable

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,959
uh interoperability between uh various

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,519
different vendors

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,040
so that um that we can have a more

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,839
heterogeneous

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
environment and that the environment of

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,880
a substation of which

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920
you know there are millions on the

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,839
planet and so you know any single actor

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,040
could be managing at the transmission

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,880
level could be managing

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
thousands uh and then at the

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,120
distribution level could be

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,680
managing many thousands of thousands so

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
you know

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,240
there are many of them in the world and

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,320
and what happens is that if you don't

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,320
have that interoperability then you

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
have vendor lock-in and if you have

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,000
vendor lock-in

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
it's not just that it's bad for the

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
utility it's also really bad for the oem

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,200
because it slows innovation it keeps

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,480
uh you know it keeps the the vendor and

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
the supplier

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,519
sort of focused on a portfolio as

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,880
opposed to really looking ahead and

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,680
you know i i describe it somewhat as

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
a driving while looking in the rear view

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
mirror

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
and what we need is to free ourselves

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
from the rear view mirror

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
and really begin looking ahead and

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,720
thinking about what we need to do and

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,279
right now

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
solving this interoperability problem is

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,120
kind of ground zero

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
and that's where compass comes in one

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
more last question before we wrap this

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
up is that

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
there are two things you know when you

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
can bring uh industries together we have

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
seen with the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
standard organization they bring

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760
industries together and they collaborate

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,399
and the second thing is open source

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,120
which kind of you know uh bypasses that

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
whole model where

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
companies based on the usage they come

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,519
together work together and then

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
standards come out of that collaboration

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,760
so how has

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,880
open source made your life easier to not

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
only convince these

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
uh stakeholders these players but also

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
to to

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
to innovate at a much faster rate than

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,880
it would take

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,640
traditional companies to do in a

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
proprietary manner so if

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,399
if if just for a moment you just

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,600
imagined in your mind

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,800
um a pie and it was

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
uh you know and each each of the wedges

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,200
in the pie

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,600
um represented uh parts of the stack

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
that you need to build and support in

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,640
order to go to market

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,200
what open source does is it allows us to

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,560
identify what are the commodity parts

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,560
of that pie and can we agree on working

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,480
on those together

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,480
that then frees up engineers

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,399
money facilitates interoperability

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,519
it does really great things to

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,640
accelerate innovation because instead of

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,680
let's say you know a siemens or a ge

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,399
or an abb or schneider electric putting

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,839
in

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:34,320
uh you know 30 of their resources

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,640
to supporting the the 61 850 integration

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
or something like that um that they

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,480
actually

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,680
can um maybe put in uh

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
you know a quarter of those engineers

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,240
and then

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,839
reallocate those resources somewhere

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
else and the same thing is true

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,880
with the utilities because for the for

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,079
the most part

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,200
um utilities have

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
uh given responsibility for their

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
network

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,079
operations at a digital level

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,120
to vendors um i would propose in the

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
future

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
that that's going to be one of the big

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
transformation points

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,839
within utilities is that they are going

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,600
to need to become

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:19,040
digitally native and uh cloud native

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,440
um because to get to where we need to go

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
it is going to be so digitally intensive

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,920
perhaps 50

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:32,079
of the problem is going to be digital so

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,079
