hi this is your host

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,839
and today we have with us ravinjin

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,360
executive director of opengs foundation

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,240
robin first of all it's nice to have you

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,920
on the show

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
thanks swapnil it's great to be here

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
thanks tell us a bit about the opengs

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,240
foundation what is the goal of the

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,560
foundation

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,560
well the goal of the openjs foundation

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
is really to be that neutral home

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,480
for javascript and web technologies

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
and really what does that mean and it

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,279
means that once a piece of technology

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
becomes really

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,680
big and important in this world it's

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
nice to have a neutral organization to

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,559
help

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
take care of it so where the ip is where

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,440
the brand is where

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,559
the team that supports it from ip legal

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,800
marketing so um we have a

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,640
great group of independent uh folks from

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
several companies who take care of those

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,160
important technologies

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,680
so think node.js appium dojo webkit

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,559
amp electron lots of great projects when

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,199
we look at

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,640
open source uh i mean i am self-taught a

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,879
lot of maintainers of

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
many major projects are self-taught some

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
have degrees in medical science but they

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
are maintaining their projects

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,840
so what is the need or importance of

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
training and certification especially

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
for

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
open source projects when anybody can

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,400
learn things on their own

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,320
yeah well that's a great question and

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,960
it's something that the industry really

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,119
thought about

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
when they put together the node js

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,840
certification

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,880
that our openjs foundation helps

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
run and that you know the javascript

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
ecosystem is really large but with

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,400
node.js in particular

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
it had reached sort of this level of

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
maturity and

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,119
implementation in large enterprises that

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,000
they thought

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,520
you know now is really a good time for

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,759
there to be sort of some level of

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,079
standardization of skills

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,799
um and actually if you think about

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,560
that a certification exam really does

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
sort of level the playing field on those

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
skills so you can have a degree from the

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
top computer science

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
university or you could have gone to

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,239
boot camp or

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,920
been in medical science as you mentioned

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
um but you can

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
take that certification exam and and

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
employers and

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,520
those in the community know that you

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,640
sort of have that basic level of skills

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
one more thing is that most companies as

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,000
part of ecosystem they have

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
their own training and certification but

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
those uh trainings are

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,879
more or less like designed for their own

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
products

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,319
but i think what is also important is to

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
know

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,160
the the basic technology is not a

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
product so that

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
you can move from one company to

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
something you become expert of that

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,920
subject

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
not of the product that's right and the

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,280
exam was divine designed actually by a

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
group

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
of technologists from a variety of

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,319
companies and a variety of open source

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,239
projects so

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,239
um if you think about um

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
that what you're being tested on it's

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
very pragmatic

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200
it's um it's really they're testing your

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,319
understanding

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,800
of key technical scenarios um and

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,680
not you know puzzles or twisters or

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
anything else

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,120
but it's really sort of scenario based

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
since you're talking about that i am

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
also curious

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,480
um if you can go a bit deeper into what

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,040
approach did the

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,319
the committee take in developing these

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,560
exams

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,159
yeah so there's two exams um and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
actually i think it started as

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,000
one and i think the community thought it

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,440
was just too large it would have been

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
like a five-hour exam

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
these exams are two hours so we have the

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400
openjs

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,840
node.js application developer exam

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,360
and we have the openjs node.js

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,560
a services developer exam so the um

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,360
app exam is really

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,120
several i think it's about 28 smaller

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
questions that sort of take five to ten

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
minutes a piece

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
that tests your basic skills and

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200
building a node.js app

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
now the services exam is different it's

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
about

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
these test questions could be 15 to 30

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
minutes a piece there are fewer

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,760
questions that you

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,439
uh follow over that two hour period and

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,599
it's really about building the server

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,880
and sort of that back end

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,519
app experience so when the again when

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,799
the

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
team put it together it was born out of

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,600
a

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
node.js interactive conference in austin

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,759
a few years ago

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
and they got together on github they put

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
together some key principles and started

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,740
designing

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
um and then

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,360
[Music]

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,720
and then just one more thing after after

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
sort of the community gave the feedback

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
the folks took it to the linux

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
foundation who are really kind of world

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
class in developing training and

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,320
certification programs

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,600
um and together with openjs we all

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,080
worked with

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,040
node source and near form who are

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
experts in the

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
in the space and so they really help

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
sort of bring that certification

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,440
experience to life one more thing is

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,440
that who can take these exams

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,720
is there any minimum qualification or

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
expectations

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,960
you know it's interesting and well you

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
know i think a junior developer it may

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,800
be difficult

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,199
but um the exams are for anybody

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,080
um in the world and you can take them

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
from

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,759
their vpm base you can take them from

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
almost every country we also have them

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,800
in chinese

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,720
but the idea is we also have a training

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
program that goes with it

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
and so you can learn at your own pace

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
and so if you have some you know really

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
great some javascript skills you

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,039
probably could take those training

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
programs

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
and do just quite well on the test a lot

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
of folks buy it you have a year to take

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
it

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
and you have a free retake if you don't

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,080
pass the first time we have a 68

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,160
uh pass rate um so you can learn at your

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
own speed or you can

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
buy the exam or the training and exam

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,880
package

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
and take it you know whatever works best

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
for you

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,039
something is happening especially with

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
this pandemic that is first of all

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,280
people

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
are working remotely companies are

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
looking at you know

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
uh remote worker which also mean that

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
you no longer have to look for

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,240
talent in the local area or in a

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,400
specific area

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,000
you can hire anybody from anywhere in

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,600
the world and if you look at open source

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,039
that's the whole idea of open source as

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
well you know people from around the

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,280
globe are contributing

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
how does this fact that now industry is

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
looking for

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,840
remote working further help your mission

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,160
well

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,240
you know i i was actually at an

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
in-person conference last year before

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
lockdown and i had the opportunity to

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
talk to a number of recruiters

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,400
and this was in the bay area of course

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
where you know everybody

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,160
uh thinks all the great work happens but

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
actually this

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,520
the remote workplace just really does

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,039
demonstrate that um

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,960
developers are essential around the

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
world there's great companies innovating

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
around the world

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,880
and the these recruiters told me that

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,120
node.js is one of the top two

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,240
uh types of developers that they're

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,960
looking for

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,960
so i think this just opens up a world of

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
opportunities for folks wherever you may

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
be

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,080
uh one interesting thing especially in

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,639
the field that we are in is that

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,960
new technologies new paradigms new

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,560
jargons new buzzwords keep coming up on

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,199
weekly basis it's becoming really hard

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,319
to keep

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,080
up with everything so how do you keep up

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,360
not only with these technologies but

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
also ensure

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,720
that people are you know when they're

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,319
taking big exams

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
it's about the latest because when they

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
go and work for a company they are going

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
to work on the technologies

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
that are still in the very early phase

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
of development that's right

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,599
absolutely technology moves fast and we

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
hope these exams move with them

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,720
we have a great again core team of

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,639
experts

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
and we just announced recently that we

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,039
just upgraded the exam

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,160
from node 10 to node 14 which is the

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,360
latest long-term

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,039
uh version of node and the idea is to

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,160
keep them evergreen from the training

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,879
and the certification

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,919
and any translations we do so whatever

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
you're tested on

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,280
will be the most uh current version of

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
node

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,520
that your employer would likely want you

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,879
to use one more that also let me

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
leads to a different question and which

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
is since new technologies are coming up

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,199
so if somebody took

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,680
an exam let's say today so is there any

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
expiration date or should because you

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
know in two years there will be new

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
technologies so whatever

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,000
certification they have today may only

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
be relevant to talk about that

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
so when you're certified you get a

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
digital badge and you can put it on your

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,800
github repo and your linkedin

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,880
and it's valid for three years um and

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
we'll just see how it goes we're open to

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,360
certifying and new technologies

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,880
and i know node is looking node is over

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
10 years old and they're looking for the

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,399
next 10 years

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,240
and our job at the openjs foundation is

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
help is to help keep node and all those

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
other technologies sort of safe and

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
modern as the

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,360
world moves forward awesome robin thank

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,440
you so much for taking time out today

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
and talk about uh not

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
yeah not only the foundation but also

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
the role of training a surveillance and

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
i look forward to talk to you again

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,399
thank you

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,399
