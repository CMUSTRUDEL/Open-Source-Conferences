Title: Linux Foundation Public Health Joins The Fight Against Pandemic
Publication date: 2021-01-22
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	Brian Behlendorf is one of the most respected luminaries of the open-source world. He has been heading the Linux Foundationâ€™s Hyperledger project since its inception and recently took over additional responsibilities of the Linux Foundation Public Health. With the new administration sworn in, there will be an increased focus on science-backed public health efforts, and the foundation is best positioned to help the public sector with the strategic availability of open-source technologies to tackle serious health crises. In this interview, we dived deep into the scope of the Linux Foundation Public Health project. Itâ€™s going to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and address many other public health issues that we may see due to climate change and so on.

hi this is your host abner bharti and

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,960
today we have with us brian valendorf

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,800
executive director of the linux

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
foundation public health initiative

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,400
brand first of all it's great to have

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,639
you on the show so i want to know from

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
your perspective how do you see

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,680
uh this project the linux foundation

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,359
public health initiative

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,119
the linux foundation public health

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,039
initiative came about

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,640
when a group of us at the linux

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,680
foundation realized at the beginning of

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
the pandemic

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
that i mean everybody i'm sure as you

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,920
were in lockdown as you're realizing

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,880
this is a whole new world in front of us

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,320
uh uh with some huge new challenges you

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
know i'm sure we like everybody we're

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,399
asking ourselves

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,760
you know um what how can we apply what

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
we know how to do

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,039
to the fight against this pandemic and

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
some of us

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,879
identified you know a bunch of people

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,000
talking about exposure notification

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,600
as a way to scale up uh contact tracing

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
contact tracing which has been done for

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
hundreds of years to try to track down

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
where

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
is the disease spread occurring and

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
who's getting sick and

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
who else should we notify and ask them

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
to quarantine and that was going to be

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,680
very challenging at the scale

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
of what we thought we'd be facing and so

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,000
a lot of people were talking about

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
ways to automate that using gps using

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,720
wi-fi

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
using bluetooth so that when phones of

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
people came into contact with

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
each other you could try to

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,840
automatically figure out who else was

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,799
exposed

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
but we also saw some pretty substantial

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,400
privacy issues with that

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,799
and concerns that if every city or state

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,720
or

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
or uh country developed their own

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,119
approach or worse if you had competing

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,799
approaches

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,560
that you would really hinder the

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,840
effectiveness of the of

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,200
of of this approach and so we started to

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,720
to do our research think about

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
figure out who was working on the right

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,320
kinds of technologies here

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,240
found a group called the tcn coalition

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,960
who was focusing on

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
on on a very privacy preserving way to

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
do this using bluetooth low energy

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
and then saw as we were doing our

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
research that model get adopted

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
uh by google and apple and rolling out

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479
something they called the google apple

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,640
exposure notification apis

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,920
um and we said okay this starts to make

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
some sense let's figure out other

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
projects in this domain

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,119
who uh everybody by the way was saying

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,640
this software needs to be open source so

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
it can be trusted so it can be shared

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,280
widely so that

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
everybody can bootstrap on it but no one

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
was really setting themselves up to

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,000
organize that effort

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
uh uh and and do it at the scale that

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
you know we've seen you need to with

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
with

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
uh open source software so we stepped in

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,599
set this up

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,120
invited some projects uh we recruited

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,800
two one called covet green another

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
called coveted shield

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,480
and these are now the basis for the apps

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,879
used in ireland

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,239
in canada in new york new jersey

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
pennsylvania delaware

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,760
a whole bunch of other states are in the

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
route to setting it up as well as other

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,560
countries

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,800
and we've we've done a lot to try to

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,280
show here's how you use these apps

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,959
to in the right way and build upon the

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,319
work being done by other cities and

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
states and other technology

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,840
organizations and in the course of doing

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,599
this so not only

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
have we helped work with the community

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,440
to get these apps deployed

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
and do that in a privacy preserving way

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
help explain the model

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,840
we realized that for linux foundation

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
public health we really should be

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,599
orienting ourselves around

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
the broader set of needs for public

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,319
health authorities

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,879
public health authorities have been

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,519
chronically underfunded as organizations

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
they've been

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
uh they don't have a lot of

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,239
technologists on staff typically

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
they've tended to be focused on data and

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
analytics which is great

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,599
but building repeatable systems has been

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
a challenge it's not something that they

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
have vendors coming to them saying that

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,080
they know how to do

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,840
and so we realized exposure notification

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
was really a subset of a broader

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
category of technologies that could be

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
deployed

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
in the fight against the pandemic and so

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
that's what lfph

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
is focusing on is organizing industry

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
and

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
other types of associations academic

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
partners

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
but really focusing on how do we meet

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
the needs of the public health

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
authorities

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,480
and build relationships with the public

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
health authorities where we can help do

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,319
capacity building

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
on their part around common technologies

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,439
in the fight against this

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
and the next pandemic and future

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,239
pandemics and other broader public

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
health needs in the long term

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,120
i want to talk about the scope of the

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,200
foundation but before that i also want

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,840
to talk about uh the kobit 19

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
credentials initiative talk a bit about

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
you know

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,840
what is it about uh why linux foundation

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,080
is hosting it and who will be

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,519
benefiting from it one set of us inside

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
the linux foundation realized hey

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,919
exposure notification was going to be a

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,440
place where

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680
open source software was really needed

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,199
and an effort that we could help uh

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,120
be the center of you know was really

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,400
needed to to address

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,639
uh the second most interesting uh

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,320
use case uh that many of us started to

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,440
focus on was this question

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,919
of vaccination records and test results

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,240
and

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,440
and this kind of need as you know we all

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
were very optimistic and

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,880
and hoped that a vaccine would arrive

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
soon even before

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
one did we realize that people being

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
able to prove that they had had a

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,840
negative test was going to be important

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,880
in terms of helping people get back to

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,479
work helping people

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
perhaps get on board a plane you know

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
those sorts of things

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
and so there had been some related work

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
taking place

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,560
inside of another community that i've

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
been leading for five years

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
uh called hyperledger which is again a

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,039
part of the linux foundation

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,240
focusing on digital identity uh uh in

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,680
in a really different way than

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,520
traditionally done with you know login

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
with facebook log in with twitter all of

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,759
your important data

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
being on on in the hands of a small set

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,880
of companies

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,160
um that you use to prove your identity

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
somewhere

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
or to share credentials somewhere and

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
instead pivoting that to a very

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
user-centered approach that says from a

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
a wallet that i hold i have documents i

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
have credentials

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
that relate to a whole number of things

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
right to uh

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,960
perhaps a driver's license a passport a

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
diploma

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,759
a title to my house you know uh these

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
sorts of things that

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
you know are identity documents and

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,160
documents that are secured

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
that are attached to me and who i am uh

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
but for which we really had no

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
infrastructure for so when the pandemic

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
hit there were a bunch of technologists

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
within our community and even beyond

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
who started to say hey how might we use

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
this technology to help digitize

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,560
vaccination records digitize test

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,000
credentials those sorts of things

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,759
they organize themselves into a

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
volunteer community called the covid

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,160
credentials initiative

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
started to iterate on use cases

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199
explaining how the technology had been

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
built could be applied to that

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,479
tried to identify gaps in the technology

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
stack

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,600
that would keep it from being used at

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,520
the scale of

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,880
every citizen on this planet uh and

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,520
their vaccination record

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,400
right i i uh and but really started to

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,240
organize the

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,360
the startups to the big companies and

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
the other partners that would be

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
necessary

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,479
to really drive a standardization effort

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
here and drive a common technology

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,240
effort

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
so uh now fph has now recognized the

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,720
strength of that community by

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,479
bringing them into lfph

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,319
being able to provide some funding for

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,599
some core leaders in that community to

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,120
be able to continue their work in

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,039
organizing it

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,400
and really what we're hoping to do is

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,080
again with our head on that

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,319
we're our focus is for the public health

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,800
authorities making sure that they are

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
informed that they make good technology

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
procurement decisions

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
and and be able to paint the landscape

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
for them for them of

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
here's the technology options here's the

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
best of breed here are the

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
the vendors you can work with who won't

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
trap you into vendor specific silos

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,560
right

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,639
and here's the path that allows us to

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
get to true interoperability so you can

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
get a vaccine

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
in one country get on a plane fly to

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,319
another country

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,240
and use a proof of that vaccine as an

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
ability to say attend a concert in

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
another country

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,400
and these are all like entirely

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
different use cases that need to come

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,759
together around the patient

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,360
so that's that's what we're focusing on

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,160
at linux foundation public health and

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
our work

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
with the covid credits initiative um and

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
ultimately at some point that will also

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,400
involve open source software

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
for the essential building blocks of

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,199
this kind of infrastructure

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
the last point that you made that's

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,680
going to be my second question is that

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
if you look at this

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
initiative most of the linux foundation

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,319
projects they kind of become umbrella

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
projects themselves they

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,240
host a lot of different projects in them

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,800
number one number two is that a lot of

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
projects

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
they also work in concert and with other

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
projects you mentioned hyperledger you

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,400
know which is you know

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,520
blockchain but then there are so i would

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
understand you know

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,759
you you joined the project i want to

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
also know first of all what as you said

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,720
you were involved from the very early on

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,319
but you were also heading there was an

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
unfortunate incident that happened

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,360
that kind of created a you know kind of

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,639
vacancy there

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,080
we all miss dencon but uh why you got

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
interest in the project

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
why you decided hey you know what i

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
should take a helm of this project

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
and now what happens to hyperledger

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
project also no certainly uh

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
the the true leadership around the

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
founding of the linux nation public

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,000
health initiative came from dan khan

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,279
who previous to this was the

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
lead of the cloud native compute

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,120
foundation has been a part of the linux

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,640
foundation since before i joined

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,000
in 2015 i believe he started 2013

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,080
has a long history of the linux

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,880
community and he tragically he passed

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
away

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,320
uh back in october um i and uh

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
not related to covid related to to other

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
other another condition but

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,080
um uh but he poured his life and poured

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,279
his heart and soul into this project and

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,200
it was a very personal

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,399
thing to get this launched and obviously

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
that affected uh

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,959
and and and um uh drove the rest of us

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
at linux foundation to figure out how to

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,240
honor that memory

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,839
by not only continuing this project but

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
asking you know perhaps this is a point

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
in time where

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
what we figured out how to do with the

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
linux foundation and even

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
uh in the open source community that we

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
really start to talk about

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,880
how this can be applied to the big

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
fights in our world right

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
to the fight for against the pandemic

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
against the

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,959
fight for better public health uh and

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,080
and uh and beyond and so

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,440
um uh public health is really our first

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,279
foray into this perhaps we'll

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
we've also started to step into climate

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,720
and energy

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
and and a few other spaces that you

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,279
could say perhaps align with the

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
sustainable development goals um and in

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,080
parallel to this within the hyperledger

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,279
community we've really started to

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,519
realize that you know

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,040
the key use cases in the blockchain

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,480
space that we've been pioneering the

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
enterprise blockchain space

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
have really been around supply chain

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,880
traceability around

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
digital identity credentials around a

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
lot of other use cases that also speak

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
to these sdgs

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
um and and have particular application

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,720
to healthcare as well

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
and i have a tiny bit of background in

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
healthcare i spent two years working

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
with the

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
department of health and human services

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,399
on open source software to help make it

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,920
easier to share medical records back

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
about a decade ago

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
so i had been watching and certainly

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
interested in how the hyperledger

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,839
community

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
was applying this to healthcare and

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,720
realized you know

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,880
why don't we why don't we up our game on

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,040
this so i i

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,720
changed my title at the linux foundation

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
i'm still executive director on

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
hyperledger but i'm now general manager

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
for

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
blockchain healthcare and identity

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,360
initiatives at the linux foundation

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
bringing together all these different

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
efforts and making sure they're

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,440
harmonized they're aligned

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
that we're not duplicating efforts but

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,399
that we're also going out there and

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
figuring out how do we really

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
to make the most of these building

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,640
blocks that the linux foundation has put

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,800
together

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,240
in the fight uh for better healthcare

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,959
for for uh

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,040
the ways in which identity is core to to

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,680
so many of the other fights uh

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,880
in this world around achieving the sdgs

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
and and beyond so

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,120
it's really exciting um it's really uh

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
nerve-wracking a bit to think about hey

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
we might

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,760
really be able to apply uh what we know

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,399
about open source software to these big

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
fights but

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
um we're all super charged about this

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,959
for 2021. and the second part of

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
is the question is also that uh can you

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,360
talk about

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,399
uh the the scope of this

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,839
initiative as you mentioned you may

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,079
start building some

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
building blocks your software stacks so

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
when we look at this

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
foundation or this project what will it

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,959
look like you know are you going to

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
build software is it going to be you

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,360
know hosting these kind of you know

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
certifications what will it look like

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
you know let's say

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,920
five months from now well the core of

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,639
every linux foundation project is

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,320
software

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
uh that is our bread and butter that is

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
our theory of change our theory of

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
change is that if you build great

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
open source software at the core of a

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
set of needs by

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
a broad community that there's a

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,440
leverage that comes from that

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,200
that lifts all boats right um and and

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
and the way to make it sustainable is to

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
build a commercially viable

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,800
uh and and and diverse commercial

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,839
ecosystem around that code

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,639
right so uh uh to be clear i

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,760
i we are still we still need industry to

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,839
help us write that code

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,360
from volunteer developers all the way to

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
the big companies in the world

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,560
working together on on common code but

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
to make that

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
code work and and get deployed out there

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,480
you need to do a lot of

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,920
uh communications about what the code

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,680
does why it's a good

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,200
approach you need to do a lot of

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,839
coalition building um

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
sometimes i i say my my unofficial title

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,440
is nerd diplomat

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
because i spend a lot of my time trying

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,240
to talk to people who might be

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
competitors who might think of

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
themselves as

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,639
uh perhaps not aligned with what we're

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
doing

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,200
and help them understand how they can

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
play a role how they can use the

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
software that's being built but also

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,279
potentially

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,040
contribute and bring their own ideas and

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,279
their own initiatives in

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,040
under the umbrella and so there's a lot

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,880
of bridge building that we do

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
to make this work and and i think that's

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,720
that's that's really a big part of what

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,680
lfph does but uh but also the linux

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
foundation as a whole

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
you have also been involved with the

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,320
with governments in previous you know uh

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
you know administrations and now we are

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
going through another

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,720
change transition is going on where we

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,720
may get more

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,399
this may be not part of the question but

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
i am trying to keep it not

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,200
political at all but uh healthcare is

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,800
or you know this project is is beyond

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
just the scope of private sector you

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
know you may get involved with the

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
government as well

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,519
so do you see any potential of working

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
with governments around the globe as

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,160
well because

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
it's just not about this pandemic for

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
the future pandemic also

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
you have to get involved at that level

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,160
you cannot

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,600
do it in isolation absolutely this has

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
to be a global effort

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,279
and we have already with linux

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,480
foundation public health been working

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,519
with health authorities uh in ireland

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,480
in canada uh in uh

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,160
in other part parts of europe i i have

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,680
started to open conversations with

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,959
health authorities in asia

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,880
in fact we have as a member of

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,240
hyperledger i'm sorry of uh linux

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,880
foundation public health

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
tencent uh one of the largest i.t

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,320
companies

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,000
in china uh and we're very hopeful that

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
the technology that's being built can be

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,120
uh it can be used by countries around

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
the world to

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,600
to to to be part of this fight and and

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,880
really we would be silly if we if we

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
were said we were just focusing on the

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,880
us or just focusing on us

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,279
on on even a particular region because

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,639
uh talent is distributed everywhere as

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
again something that the open source

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,720
community has really demonstrated is

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
um you really can build these

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
communities that are that are global

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,880
first

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
right even even if they're small uh to

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,560
start uh

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920
but uh um but yeah the this is this bug

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,839
is the same i mean there's there's

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,600
mutations and variants around the world

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,360
but we're all in the same fight here

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,360
and and in so many other ways public

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
health is a truly global fight so

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
we are working uh intently with public

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
health authorities around the world to

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
make this work

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,199
right now we are talking about kobe 19

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,120
but the scope of

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
this project does it go beyond that

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
because if you look at for example

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,399
cancer is one of the biggest you know

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,240
challenges that humanity is facing today

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,040
and the one of the major work that is

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,680
going on is imaging you know if you can

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
you know scan early in the time then you

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
can also

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,000
and of course a lot of technologies are

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,639
being developed aiml is playing a very

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
big role

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
open source is also playing a big role

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,240
so do you think

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,120
that uh the scope of this project will

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
go beyond that

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
and you will also uh focus on those

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,720
issues

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,680
those diseases as well and the on the

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,079
positive side

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
a lot of deep learning aiml data

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,720
projects are already there within linux

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
foundation a lot of open source

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,240
technologies already there within linux

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
foundation so talk about the wider scope

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,720
of this project

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,600
right now there's a really good question

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,839
so um so there's a lot of aspects to

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
healthcare and to technology and from

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,560
the application of

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
information technology to healthcare i

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,120
love the example of

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,079
using machine learning and ai to scan

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,079
x-rays to try to detect signs of

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,560
cancerous lesions earlier

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,680
that's certainly a hugely appropriate

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
application of the tech

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,440
and as you might know at the linux

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,639
foundation we have projects in big data

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,079
and we have projects in ai and and as i

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,519
understand it those technologies are

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,360
being used in some of the

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,880
the the trials out there around um

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
applying that to the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,959
the the fight against cancer from a from

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
the linux foundation public health point

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,440
of view

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
our lens is what are the public health

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,360
authorities really care about right

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
something like an early detection of

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,839
cancer by scanning an image

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
is a clinical type of issue it's

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,560
something that

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,320
uh people who build systems for doctors

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,560
and hospitals and and the like

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
are going to really care about at a

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,000
public health level what you care about

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,680
is things like health surveillance like

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,519
understanding okay across my entire

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,120
country or state

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,720
is the incidence of cancer i

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,240
stronger in some areas rather than

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
others and it turns out that it's the

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
areas that are close to highways or rail

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
lines or

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
industrial plants or something like that

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,919
right um uh

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,000
so that's where there's a bit of a

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,439
nuance to it right if a project were to

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
emerge then open source project that

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,079
that

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,919
said hey we want to use machine learning

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,120
to do x-ray scans

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
we'd certainly take a look at it

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,559
particularly if there was a public

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,600
health authority behind it saying hey we

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,600
plan to use this as a public health tool

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,520
especially for to improve the the health

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
of the population as a whole

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,799
one thing we also are very careful to

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,160
try to do is say hey if there's a better

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,720
existing project

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
that this should go towards um then

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
let's do that i certainly don't

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,679
think we will be the only health project

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
inside the linux foundation then i know

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,280
we're not

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,360
the only one outside the linux

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,559
foundation we're really keen to

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
to work with anybody who's got

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,919
successful traction with their projects

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,280
already

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
on that kind of thing and really look at

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,720
it with the lens of what do the public

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
health authorities need

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,600
and i think that'll help set the scope

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
for us as we were talking earlier

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,039
climate change let's say you know that

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,400
will create a lot of challenges

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,720
so any any health related issue or topic

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,559
that arises from that which involves you

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
know government sector you know public

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,080
that's where you'll be playing a role if

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,240
i'm not wrong it could be it could be

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
priority it could be malnutrition in a

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
lot of you know poor countries

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,520
it could be a lot of different things so

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,440
anything uh whatever impact there will

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,799
be on the larger population that's where

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,679
you will get involved it goes beyond

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,880
just this pattern

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,240
absolutely you know there's a lot of

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
interest in the healthcare community

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
these days and something called the

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,240
social determinants of health

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,640
where things like education levels or

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,320
or substance abuse or mental and mental

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
health and the roles those play in

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,520
physical health and

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,960
driving outcomes and affecting the cost

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,880
of health care and communities and that

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,039
sort of thing

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,799
there's my cat in the background and so

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,000
those those kinds of projects

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,000
could be appropriate it'd certainly be

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,799
something to consider you know we are

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
trying to

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,000
be focused right now on the fight

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,080
against the pandemic but um

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,679
you know the pandemic is affecting so

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,039
many different parts of our lives

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,039
uh that is certainly something we're

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,400
taking a look at so anything else so you

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,600
think we are good there and we can wrap

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
this up it's a new year

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,720
it's a really exciting time to be

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,880
thinking about how

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
we might apply these technologies to to

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,160
some of the big challenges in the world

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,679
the pandemic but also beyond

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
um and i really want to encourage

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,559
developers out there who

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,640
perhaps they're not in the healthcare

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,960
space now perhaps they're not

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
uh they haven't been a part of uh you

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,600
know fighting the pandemic or being a

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,440
part of these other challenges

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,880
um i'd encourage them to take a look i

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,280
mean one of the things we really hope to

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,240
do

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,520
is connect developers who want to have a

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,360
positive impact with

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
projects that could use their help with

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,760
uh the the the public health authorities

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,760
or other people working in that space

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
we never have enough developers working

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,360
on things and um

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,720
you know if if your day job means you

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,600
know making ad networks

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
more more performant by 5.5 percent

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,559
maybe

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
your your hobby or your night job might

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
be helping make the world a better place

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,160
um

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,520
and if that's of interest to you come to

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,080
lfph.io or the broader linux foundation

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,240
site

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,000
and let's see if we can connect you to

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
something that that that helps us all

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
