Description: 
	Brian Behlendorf is one of the most respected luminaries of the open-source world. He has been heading the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project since its inception and recently took over additional responsibilities of the Linux Foundation Public Health. With the new administration sworn in, there will be an increased focus on science-backed public health efforts, and the foundation is best positioned to help the public sector with the strategic availability of open-source technologies to tackle serious health crises. In this interview, we dived deep into the scope of the Linux Foundation Public Health project. It’s going to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and address many other public health issues that we may see due to climate change and so on.
