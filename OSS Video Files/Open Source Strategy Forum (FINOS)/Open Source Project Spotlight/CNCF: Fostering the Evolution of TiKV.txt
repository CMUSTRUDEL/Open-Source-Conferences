Description: 
	PingCAP had high hopes that its TiKV project would develop into a building block for the next generation of distributed systems by providing a reliable high quality and practical storage foundation. To accomplish that, it decided to contribute TiKV to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to make it vendor-neutral and widely used across organizations. It seems headed in that direction, especially now that the project recently graduated, further demonstrating its maturity and sustainability. On behalf of the Linux Foundation, Swapnil Bhartiya, founder and host of TFiR, sat down with two members of the TiKV project, Siddon Tang and Calvin Weng, to learn more about the projectâ€™s evolution.
