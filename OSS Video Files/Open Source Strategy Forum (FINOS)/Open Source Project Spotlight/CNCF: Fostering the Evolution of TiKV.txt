Title: CNCF: Fostering the Evolution of TiKV
Publication date: 2020-12-08
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	PingCAP had high hopes that its TiKV project would develop into a building block for the next generation of distributed systems by providing a reliable high quality and practical storage foundation. To accomplish that, it decided to contribute TiKV to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to make it vendor-neutral and widely used across organizations. It seems headed in that direction, especially now that the project recently graduated, further demonstrating its maturity and sustainability. On behalf of the Linux Foundation, Swapnil Bhartiya, founder and host of TFiR, sat down with two members of the TiKV project, Siddon Tang and Calvin Weng, to learn more about the projectâ€™s evolution.

hi this is your host of nine party and

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,440
today we have

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,679
two members of the thai kv project

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,719
howland community manager and

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,320
new tank chief engineer at pincap and

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
he's also a thai kv maintainer how liu

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
first of all

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,840
welcome to the show hi hi

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
thanks for having us what is tai ki kv

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,359
project

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,599
and what problem you are trying to solve

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,800
hi

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,880
kibi is a open source distributor

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
transactional keyword database

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,200
kiwi is inspired by the google spanner

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,840
at f1 the design is simpler and more

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
practical

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,960
why did we want to develop thai

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,399
and in pink hat we start with starting

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
cap five years ago

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
and at that time we want to build a

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,680
distributed

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,239
database a circle database

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,079
and maybe my circle compatibility

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,320
support domestic protocol

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,920
and at that time we at first we built a

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,840
circle layer and then we want to

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,520
uh build uh we want a

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,960
key value storage layer and to support

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,159
our database at first we

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,439
tried to use edge base but at that time

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,240
we found that the

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,880
performance is very bad so we decided a

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
few

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
build our own distributed key value

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,119
database so that's why

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
that's how thai query comes how do you

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
have to add anything there

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
techie was originally created to

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,640
complement thai db

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,840
and so but uh we soon realized that

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,520
uh techyv the project could be

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,960
uh decoupled from the tide from teddy b

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,040
project and

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,759
served as a unified distributed storage

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,119
storage layer as far as strong data

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
consistency

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
distributed transactions horizontal

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,880
scalability and

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,160
cloud native active architecture

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,480
so and also we realized that

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,480
as the amount of data it generates

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,680
um more and more so this could be

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
in a lot of demands in this in the cloud

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,319
native

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:31,200
uh community so that's why

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:34,000
we donated it to the cncf

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
that to to build to make it a build

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,920
block

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,160
for for the next generation of

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
distributed system

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,360
by you know providing a reliable high

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,959
quality and

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,120
practical storage foundation

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,640
actually this is also the mission of

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,959
thai tv can you also tell

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,599
how is cncf helping thai kb community to

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,000
grow

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,800
yeah thanks for this question actually

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
this

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
is the question that i want to talk

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
about because i have been the icing

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
between the cnc and the technique

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,440
project

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
the cncf actually and you know has been

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,440
immensely helpful in

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,319
in shaping tech here into what it is

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,840
today

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,480
uh in terms of both the both of the

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
project

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,599
and the community so actually there are

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
some

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,959
key words that i would like to elaborate

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,319
on when you

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,200
ask about this question and the first

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,080
key word is neutrality um you know the

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,000
cncf

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,040
provides a neutral home um

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,959
to projects like ours so that

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,480
developers from different organizations

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,040
are willing to collaborate contribute

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
and you know eventually eventually

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,519
become the

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,720
leaders in the project this is uh

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,000
very important for the broader community

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,799
community to perceive techyv as a vendor

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
neutral and the universal project which

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
is in line

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,280
with our mission and so that they will

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,439
feel techie belongs to the community

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,319
instead of a single company like ming

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
pincap

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,320
so people that people feel comfortable

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
adopting it

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,120
or developing their own apps

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,320
on thai kiwi and for example we have

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,840
three radius on thai kiwi projects

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,479
and also we we we have a permit to use

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
some type

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,080
project that's that even features seeing

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,600
their

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,639
own official documentation and also our

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
uh our maintaining companies like zhufu

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
and edn's

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,280
string both of them are are building

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,320
their own

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,440
um systems or platforms

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,720
on thai kiwi directly without

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,600
relying on the on thai db

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
so these are actually all amazing

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
contributions to

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,039
the project from the com the from the

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
community

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:10,080
it's not from any you know from

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,120
pin cap or from pincap yeah actually

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,800
uh this is uh the neutrality

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,479
and also another key word is uh exposure

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,240
i think uh another aspect this is uh

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,639
also a import important aspect

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
specifically it means that the pubs the

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
publicity and

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
the marketing support that we get from

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,639
cncf

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
it's very important for a project like

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
tech tv

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
because we are building a great project

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,199
and we

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,840
we wanted to to be known by the

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
broader coordinative community so that

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
more

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,120
people and more companies could get

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,479
involved

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,000
uh and it also means more

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,759
adoptions of course uh so in this sense

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,199
the cubicle like the scene webinar

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,919
and the sincere blog articles they all

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,240
helped a lot in promoting our technology

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,600
in

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,479
sharing our experiences and best

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,759
practices last but not least not least

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,360
is diversity

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,639
i think this is built on the

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,120
previous two keywords so by diversity i

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
mean

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,360
you know the first is the diversity in

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,880
maintainer and the contributor structure

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,680
so uh with in the past two years we have

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
seen more and more

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
antennas from different companies like

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,960
we have

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,800
seven maintainers which are distributed

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,319
in four companies this is very important

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
criteria for cncf

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,599
you know to decide whether you're you

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120
have met

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,680
the uh the criteria

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
for graduation since you mentioned

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,039
graduation

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,440
uh can you talk about what does it mean

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
for

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,720
a project like thai kiwi to

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,479
become a graduated product how does it

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,599
does it affect the project how does it

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
affect the users

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,039
for the project uh as i mentioned

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,560
you know techyv has a has a lot of

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,199
adoptions like

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,479
around uh 1000 adopters in production

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,120
and they are better tested but now we

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,160
moved from incubation to graduated

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,599
projects

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,240
i i think it's a very solid

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
and uh and convincing validation of the

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,120
techyv project

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,639
for its growing adoption and for its

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,919
uh open governance in the community

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,360
and for its future maturity and for its

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,199
strong commitments

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,240
to the uh community and sustained

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,120
sustainability as well

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,000
so the this recognition from cncf could

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,960
could

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
not be more you know exciting and

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,919
important

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,199
for the for the project and then for us

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
as well

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,000
and also uh to answer your second

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,199
question from the user's

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
perspective i think this this means

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
simply

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,120
you know the credibility and reliability

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,879
of the project

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,000
this means that techyv is a mature

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,800
enough project or database

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
for for the cloud native architecture

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,399
this

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,959
it also means that the techyv community

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,279
is a

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,560
healthy active community that's going to

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,719
be around there

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
long enough so that they could get

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,320
involved or you know

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:48,399
attend if they have their own spot

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,839
yeah it's really you know boosts the

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,240
confidence in users yes very true

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
very true one last question before we

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
wrap this up

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,839
can you talk about the road map of the

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,959
thai kv project what do you have in the

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,760
pipeline

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,440
okay that's a good question and for the

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,720
roadmap of thai kv

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,920
at first we want to necessarily

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,279
to run more faster more easier to

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,480
use and more cost effective

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,519
so which means in the we have just

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,279
released type

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,000
kiwi 4.0 version and

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,000
maybe next year we will release the tech

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,040
cree 5.0 version

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,240
in this uh in this version and

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,760
we just want to let tech we can run

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,279
more friendly on the cloud so we will

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
try to not techie run and maybe can run

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,440
away

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,880
on the aws ebs cloud disk

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,080
and but underneath later we

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,080
just want to build a tech v to

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,680
maybe to fit the aws s3

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,360
or any other cloud storage and to make

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,720
it actually more

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,760
quality and the other thing is that we

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,880
might want to let hackweed to be

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,399
uh you can uh fit more

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,279
different workloads so we uh try to

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,920
not technically not only support the

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
roxby

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,760
engine but the warsaw can

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,440
support any other different engines for

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,720
example white tiger

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,880
and etc to uh to maybe

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,079
so to satisfy different workloads

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,640
and maybe the long-term goal

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,279
of tyqui is that maybe we want to

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,279
introduce

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:46,480
ai so maybe we can use the ai driven to

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,519
nasa techie to use different engines to

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,440
certify different workloads

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,560
and that's the maybe the word ruler

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,360
of the tech tv awesome

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
