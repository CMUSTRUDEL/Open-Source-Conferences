Title: Akraino: An Open Source Project For The Edge
Publication date: 2020-09-30
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	Akraino (https://www.lfedge.org/projects/akraino/) is an open source project designed for the Edge community to easily integrate open source components into their stack. Basically, itâ€™s a set of open infrastructures and application blueprints for the Edge, spanning a broad variety of use cases, including 5G, AI, Edge IaaS/PaaS, IoT, for both provider and enterprise edge domains. We sat down with Tina Tsou, TSC Co-Chair of Akraino project to learn more about the project and its community.

hi this is nipah and today we have with

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,440
us

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,040
tinatsu you are tsc co-chair of aquino

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,599
project tell us a bit about

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,400
what is a cleaner project yeah i think

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
acreeno

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,199
is a edge stack project and then linked

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,199
foundation edge before equaling node the

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
developers has to go to the upstream

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,720
community

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
to download upstream software components

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,279
and integrate

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,760
install the test but with the

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,279
blueprint ideas and concept the

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,399
developers can directly

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
do the use case-based blueprint do all

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,120
the integration

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,879
and ready for the end-to-end deployment

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
for edge so the blueprints are the

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
critical piece of it

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
yes so what are these blueprints and how

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
do they integrate you know with the

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
whole framework

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,600
yeah based on the certain use case we do

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,680
the community ci cd continuous

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,960
integration and continuous derived

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,199
deployment and also we have a proven

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
and security requirements we do the

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,199
community lab

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
and we also do the lifecycle life cycle

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,320
management

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
and then we do the production quality

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,680
which is deployment

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
ready can you explain a bit what does

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
the cloud you know

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,119
edge computing framework looks like edge

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,720
computing framework

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:21,439
looked like we have four segments

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,520
cloud telco iot and enterprise

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,560
when we do the framework it's like

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
we have a framework of edge compute in

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
general

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,400
but for each segment they're slightly

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
different

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
you will see in the lower level you have

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
the network

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
you have the gateway you have the

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,759
switches and the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,320
upper of it you have all kinds of fpga

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,960
and then the data plan then you have the

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,880
control

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,840
controllers and orchestration like um

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
the kubernetes stuff and all kinds of

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
applications running on bare metal or

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
virtual machines

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,759
or the the containers yeah

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,759
and by the way we also have the

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,439
orchestration on the side and

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,799
how many blueprints are there can you

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,280
talk more

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,560
specifically yeah i think we had around

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,400
20-ish blueprints but they are

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,400
converged into a plus blueprint families

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
like we have blueprint family for telco

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,239
appliances including radioactive cloud

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,040
and siba the sdn enabled a broadband

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,440
access

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,440
we also had a blueprint of network cloud

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
we have blueprint the integrated edge

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,840
cloud

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,879
we have blueprint of edgelite iot

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
so in this case the different blueprints

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
in the same blueprint family can share

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
the same software framework

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
which saves a lot of time that means we

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
can deploy the enlarged scale

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,319
and the software components which are

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,360
talking about it

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,959
in each blueprint are they all in

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,879
edge project or there are some external

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,160
can you talk about these components

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,519
okay this component we first

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,360
we take the philosophy upstream first

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
if we can find it from the upstream

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
community we just directly take it from

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
upstream community

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,480
and install and integrate if we find

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
something like

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
um we need some addition we go to

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,400
upstream community to see whether

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,760
it can be changed or update there if it

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
doesn't know this is a

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
piece it can be directed within uh

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,000
equino

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,840
we would do it as a future project can

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,159
be used by several blueprints

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
how challenging or easy it is to

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,239
integrate these components together

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
to build the framework yeah it depends

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,879
on which blueprint family you're talking

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
about i think

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,680
most of them at the level of middle not

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,120
too easy not too complex

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,680
yeah so um but the developers has to

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
create installation like the yama files

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,640
configuration

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120
and for build some iso images some part

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,840
may be more complex and somehow will be

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
just easy

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
and download and integrate okay now

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,920
let's just

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,360
narrow it down can you talk about which

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,560
lfh projects

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,879
you're consuming or using yeah i think

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
uh we got a proposal from different

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599
companies

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,280
in integrated eve integrate

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,919
uh flash and integrate uh

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
ajax foundry yeah in different

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,560
blueprints

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,240
we have talked about the project i want

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
to talk about the community

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
so first of all tell us what is the role

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,280
of tsc

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,720
we have the whole bunch of documented

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,199
how tsc runs

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,479
if you want to read i think the role of

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,840
tse is more technical steering

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,240
we have chair and co-chair and there are

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
like

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,639
six to seven subcommittees on the tsc

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,600
uh for the specific uh topics like a

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
security

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,960
technical community ci and documentation

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,320
process and security yeah uh and what

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,000
kind of communities there

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,400
around acronym project i think we have a

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,960
pretty diverse

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,240
community like distributed we have the

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
end user

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,919
like the telcos and hyperscalers the

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
internet company

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,560
and also enterprise company and then

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,680
have oem odm vendors

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
and chips and makers and or the sock

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,800
makers

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,120
and then have the ip companies so

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
and even some universities tina thank

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
you so much

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
for taking your time today and

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,960
explaining the acronym projects

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,560
uh and also about the the blueprints and

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,160
the community and the roadmap for the

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
project and i look forward to seeing you

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
again to get more updates about the

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
project

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
