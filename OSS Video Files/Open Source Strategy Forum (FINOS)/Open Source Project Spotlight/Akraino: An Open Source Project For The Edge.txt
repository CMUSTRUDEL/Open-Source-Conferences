Description: 
	Akraino (https://www.lfedge.org/projects/akraino/) is an open source project designed for the Edge community to easily integrate open source components into their stack. Basically, itâ€™s a set of open infrastructures and application blueprints for the Edge, spanning a broad variety of use cases, including 5G, AI, Edge IaaS/PaaS, IoT, for both provider and enterprise edge domains. We sat down with Tina Tsou, TSC Co-Chair of Akraino project to learn more about the project and its community.
