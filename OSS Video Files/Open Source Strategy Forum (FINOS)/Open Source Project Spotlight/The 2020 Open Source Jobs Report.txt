Description: 
	The 2020 Open Source Jobs Report just came out so we took the opportunity to speak with Clyde Seepersad, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Training and Certification at the Linux Foundation, about the significance of the report and the insights it provides on the current open source landscape. He touched on the effects of COVID-19 on hiring trends, the open source skills that are in high demand, and how the Foundation is helping organizations meet this demand through high-quality intensive training. Bottom line, he says “We still don't have enough open source talent. The urgency of finding new ways to bring talent into the market continues to be something that should be front and center for all of us.”
