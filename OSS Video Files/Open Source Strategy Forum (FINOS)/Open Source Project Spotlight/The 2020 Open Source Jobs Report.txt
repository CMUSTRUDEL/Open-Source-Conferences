Title: The 2020 Open Source Jobs Report
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	The 2020 Open Source Jobs Report just came out so we took the opportunity to speak with Clyde Seepersad, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Training and Certification at the Linux Foundation, about the significance of the report and the insights it provides on the current open source landscape. He touched on the effects of COVID-19 on hiring trends, the open source skills that are in high demand, and how the Foundation is helping organizations meet this demand through high-quality intensive training. Bottom line, he says “We still don't have enough open source talent. The urgency of finding new ways to bring talent into the market continues to be something that should be front and center for all of us.”

	00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,560
the linux foundation has come out with

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,440
its latest

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
open source jobs report uh this report

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
plays a very important role in

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,759
understanding the demand for open source

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,559
talent and

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,119
trends among open source professionals

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,640
to deep dive into this 2020 report today

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,840
we have with us once again light

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
supersad

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,080
svp and gm of training and certification

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
at the linux foundation client

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,160
it's nice to have you again on the show

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,160
hey swapnil thanks for having me

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
as i was saying this report plays a very

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
important role but i want to hear your

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
perspective because you lead this effort

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,879
what is the importance of this report

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
not only for the open source ecosystem

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
but uh companies out of the outside of

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,640
the open source ecosystem because today

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,239
almost everybody is leveraging open

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,520
source in one capacity or another

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,719
yes one of the things that we realized

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,879
several years ago is that there are

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
there's a lot of data around general

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,160
employment reports

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,680
and a fair few around i.t and technology

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,879
in general but there was really this gap

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,439
when it comes to

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
what's happening on open source talent

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,880
and we kept hearing anecdotally

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
that people can't hire uh can't find

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
enough talent

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
and so what we wanted to do was put a

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
really

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
clear spotlight on what's going on

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,759
specifically when it comes to the talent

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,320
pool around

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,960
open source uh to be able to share with

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,040
the market

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
a sort of non-anecdotal state of the

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
world but also to be able to inform

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,880
our own strategy and our own mission

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
which is to try to ensure not just that

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
there's

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,680
fantastic code coming out of open source

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,079
projects but also that there is enough

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
talent to implement and use that what

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,000
are some of the key highlights of this

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
report

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,200
couple of things one is

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
the rise of devops skills i think

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,000
everybody knows cloud is hot

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,840
it's been that way for a while uh but

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
you know the companion piece to that

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,640
around

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,119
devops and the importance of

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,880
understanding ci cd pipelines and also

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,600
the cultural difference of working

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
in that sort of continuous delivery uh

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,799
the rise of that i think

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
is something that maybe most people are

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
not quite as aware

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
of uh the second thing i would highlight

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,599
is

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,360
that there was a lot of questions about

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,319
what's happening to tech hiring

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
in the uh in response to the kovit

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,200
pandemic

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,000
uh we have some answers for that that

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,480
says that although hiring slowed down

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
it did not slow down nearly as much as

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,680
people might have

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
worried at the outset and in fact is now

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,440
accelerating

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,080
and the i guess the top level thing

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,480
which

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
is continuing to be the case is just we

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
you know we still don't have enough open

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,360
source talent so

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
you know the urgency of finding new ways

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
to bring talent into the market

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
continues to be something that should be

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,840
front and center

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,720
for all of us what are the skills

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,879
that are kind of not only most in demand

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,159
but also hardest to find so that is like

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,159
a chicken the next solution right

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,360
yeah you know uh the obviously cloud

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,480
skills right so

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,000
uh they they a lot of it the companies

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,159
smaller companies

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
uh more conservative companies the

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,239
pandemic has pushed them

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,280
to be much more active on the cloud and

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,959
what that's done is

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,720
raise the stakes in terms of people who

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
are familiar with cloud native

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
development cognitive architecture

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
kubernetes orchestration

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
uh and then what does the ict pipelines

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
look like

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
in a cloud world because obviously

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
there's some changes there when you're

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
running

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,159
that sort of infrastructure um

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
so those those interwoven skill sets

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,159
right and of course

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,319
sitting on underneath all of that is

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,480
uh what operating system is the cloud

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,959
run on and i think we all know now that

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,280
this vast fast you know 98 plus percent

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,200
of

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,599
instances are running on linux and so

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,120
you have this tiered approach where

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,319
understanding from basic linux

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,920
competence is a baseline um

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,840
and then you're building on top of that

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,439
with looking for cloud native

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
development uh cloud native

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,239
orchestration

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,319
and um and then what the cicd pipelines

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
look like to bring that to life

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,160
in addition to just coming out with this

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
report uh do you have any kind of you

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,799
know

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,199
advice or suggestion to the hiring

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
managers you know what can they do

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,040
to attract you know top episodes

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
developers or talent

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
to their organizations because there is

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,000
habit everybody wants them so

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,960
right well you know so some other things

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,600
actually have happened

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,360
in response to the pandemic right so uh

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
one of the trends we saw last year was

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,040
people wanting the flexibility

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
to be able to work from home of course

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,919
now we all work from home

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,360
uh so that helps but

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,759
what came out in the report that was

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
really interesting is that

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,400
more and more talent managers are

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,639
realizing that you don't just have to go

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
externally for talent that you can in

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
fact upskill people who are currently

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
in your organization so we are seeing

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
the data suggests that

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,880
a lot more people are waking up and

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,160
realizing that you know

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,840
trolling linkedin for your next hire is

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
a zero sum game because other people are

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,360
doing the same

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,120
and they're starting to invest more in

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
training especially online training

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
they're starting to invest more in

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
certifications for their employees and

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,000
just in general they're starting to

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,919
be much more proactive in looking at the

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,280
existing internal talent pool and

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,800
finding ways to provide new

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
opportunities for development and of

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
course that also comes with new

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
job opportunities for the existing

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
employee days

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
and i just want to talk a little bit

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,600
more about kobe 19 as well a couple of

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
things are happening with kobe 19 of

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
course it is also a lot of companies are

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,479
scaling down they don't you know they

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
are cutting budgets and everything

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,639
uh at the same time uh since people

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
are able to work remotely you don't have

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,080
to relocate yourself or you don't have

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
to find telling the same area you know

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
you you have

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
access to almost everybody wherever they

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,000
are so how has

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,560
kovit 19 affected the

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
the hiring process itself in terms of

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
well they do have to scale

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,039
down some to some extent uh the beauty

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,840
is i mean i should not say that but dvd

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
is that uh

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
the word that we are living in is all

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
powered by clouded technology without

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
that we would not be getting

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,639
food tour i mean all the services or all

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,199
the purchase that i was making or

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,560
even my indian grocery they are they now

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,800
have a website i can just go

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
and place or it was not the case earlier

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,759
so cloud is actually enable

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,759
companies to stay in business so it is

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,600
so that also means that you do need

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
developer and all those talents to keep

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,039
those businesses running

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
at the same time you have advantage of

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
not having to relocate

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
so talk a bit about it yeah that's true

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
i think the they

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
uh and it all does tie together right so

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,240
as people have

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,720
been forced to use the cloud more i had

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,840
the same experience you did and my local

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
chinese uh restaurant certainly

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
developed a website and ordering

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,919
capabilities that they did not

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,759
previously have

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,759
so you have this broader footprint of

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,479
businesses you know the old saw about

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,520
every business

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,840
is now an e-commerce business it is true

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
right so there's this broader footprint

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,400
and uh

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,000
uh on the flip side of it you also have

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
people who are now having to work from

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,639
home

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,319
uh where they maybe didn't used to

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,039
either for practical or maybe

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,800
cultural reasons within the company uh

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,599
and that also then intersects with

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,479
the the sort of cultural change and the

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
cultural norms of cicd and devops right

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
and so this

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
idea that you have to be inputting

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,319
together versus this idea that you have

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,080
a well-documented pipeline and everybody

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,319
can contribute to that pipeline and do

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
their commits and do their pulls

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,160
that whole tooling ecosystem of cloud

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,000
native and devops has actually

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
made it easier and i would argue

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
possible to do

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
what's happened and what we've seen over

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,160
the past several months which is people

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,319
being productive

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,840
working from home working with people

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,840
they haven't worked with before

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,120
onboarding new team members and being

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
able to get them

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,800
provisioned with the right access and

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,639
upskill on the right systems

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
yeah it's all really come together

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,919
there's you know

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,560
we have that in my view we have been

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,160
lucky to that we've got the technology

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
infrastructure that we have today

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
because

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
i don't know that we would have been

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,199
able to stay uh

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,639
as productive and focused in a shift

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,640
to a certain shift to remote work if

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
we were trying to do this even five

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,959
years ago and i

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,200
i i'm a good example of that because uh

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,200
i have been working from home

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
ever since you know i moved out of india

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
and what i realized was that i

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
work when i feel that i'm most

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,200
productive instead of hey you know i

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,279
have clogged at 9 00 a.m and i have to

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,399
clock out at 5 pm i have to sit there

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,160
and do something

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
it doesn't matter how i feel and then

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
sometimes there are personal issues also

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
somebody's sick in the family so your

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
mind is there

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,920
but you have to come to office but with

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
you know remote working

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,320
you just you know i think remote working

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,920
offers the best you know balance between

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
work and life i mean of course it is

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,560
actually more challenging because you

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
may end up working all the time

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,480
but still it offers uh a better uh

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
balance now earlier you're talking about

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
uh

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,200
that uh you don't have to go out

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,000
to hire people you can also internally

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
you can train people so when we look at

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
organizations

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,320
uh and they look at all these new you

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
know

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
cloud native technologies and they want

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
to retain

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
or prepare their own workforce what

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,760
resources are available there

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,959
especially from the linux foundation

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
because you know the training is their

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,839
certification is there

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,839
so that they can better equip their own

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
workforce uh

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,040
when there is already a shortage of a

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
lot of talent yeah

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
it's a good question swapnan uh you know

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,200
from a practical perspective the

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,800
portfolio that we have provided which is

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,720
very heavily focused on

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,399
self-paced e-learning that you take

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
online but

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
at the same time very skills based right

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,040
so very lab intensive

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,040
online training because ultimately what

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
do you care about as a colleague or as a

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,839
hiring manager it's not whether they

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,519
check the box and they have a

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
certificate saying they completed a

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
course

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,920
what you care about is the skills right

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
they actually develop those skills and

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,079
so we've got a pretty big portfolio of

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,320
very hands-on

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,920
e-learning self-hd learning programs to

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
help people develop the skills

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,000
and then we've continued to build our

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
portfolio of performance-based

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
certification exams so this is not

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
your grandad's pick and answer out of

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
our lineup right these are live systems

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
with variable questions and you have to

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,959
demonstrate your skills

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
under the pressure of time under the

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,680
pressure of being proctored by an

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,680
independent person

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,440
and i think that one two punch of really

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,040
focusing on skills

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
you know i joke with people all the time

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,399
we get uh you know we get feedback

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,560
sometimes but

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,040
our courses aren't uh don't have enough

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,480
video and i say well

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
true because we're not trying to

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
entertain you we're trying to develop

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
skills

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
the way you develop skills is not by

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,839
staring at a screen and

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,600
listening to a video the way you develop

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
skills is by doing a lab

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,279
and so we've got a very lab-centric

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,680
mindset in terms of

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,760
the training side of it and that carries

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
on into the certification side of it

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
where it's all about performance like

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,880
sure that you can do the work

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
take the time to develop the skills

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
because that's what your colleagues are

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
going to be looking for that's what your

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,040
employers are going to be looking for

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,880
and that's what's going to benefit you

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,920
personally as an individual is to be

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,160
able to have that broader skill set

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,240
and to be able to do that in a remote

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,640
way and not have to rely on a

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
senior trainer coming onto site and

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
working with you

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,760
i think that's going to be the new

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
normal so um now the advantage is that

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,800
you know because of this crisis is that

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
people are realizing that they don't

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
have to move

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,760
they can actually they can move to the

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,440
place ideal place that we wanted to live

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
it could be a big ranch it could be a

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
beach

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,279
and they can work for companies who are

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
operating from silicon valley which also

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,600
means you can also cross

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,600
national boundaries you can get the the

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
whole idea of open source is the best

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,639
and the brightest people from around the

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
globe so

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,120
how do you enable these people because

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,160
people come from different cultural

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
background different educational

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,120
background different languages

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,880
so do you also help them irrespective of

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,920
where they're coming from so

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,600
whether it's internationalizing or

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
supporting different languages so people

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,160
can get trained

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,959
so yes as lf training we do that so we

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,279
have

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,200
obviously the online format helps right

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,720
because it's truly available 24

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
7 globally nights and weekends

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
so that really has expanded the

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,360
footprint of what we're able to do and

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,600
who we are able to reach

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,480
uh we've also done some translations

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
particularly

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,839
for the certification exams to make

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,560
those available

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
in languages that we know folks may not

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,320
otherwise be comfortable with so for

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,480
japan and for china for instance

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,160
uh but you know what we're trying to do

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,120
is mirror what we're seeing

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,959
in the workforce right the shift towards

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
more remote workers actually opened up

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,959
the pipeline when you think about

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,399
hiring and talent management you know if

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
you think about somebody who's in the

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,480
u.s or in western europe

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,560
your pool is not as limited right you

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,600
really can reach out to this global pool

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,160
of talent

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,760
uh in non-traditional markets right and

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
so we've seen

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,880
sectors get hot right obviously you know

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
india was hot for

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,120
a lot of work shift today there's a ton

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
of stuff happening in eastern europe now

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,639
but it really is global right you know

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,440
we've got folks on our team in south

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,839
america

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
um being super productive in this new

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,480
remote way of working

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,240
and i think that's that's becoming more

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,839
and more typical right which is that

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,600
folks are able because of the rise of

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
cloud native because of the rise of this

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
sort of collaborative devops mindset

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,480
are able to collaborate across regions

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,680
across countries across time zones much

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
more effectively

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,000
than they ever have before awesome clyde

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
thank you so much for

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,279
talking to me today about not only this
