hi this intently we have it does a

00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,420
special guest from India just korat

00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,250
Singh who is founder of could you know

00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,740
it's an open source project or community

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,420
that's building amazing software for

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,950
social networking just get out first of

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,579
all welcome to the show now tell us a

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,099
bit about the project itself so gordinho

00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:23,590
is open source software development

00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:25,480
commentary there desires a potential to

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,960
change the way other communities use

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,489
other projects use create an open source

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,559
environment and sustainable tools to

00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,690
better align with end-user expectations

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,910
so basically this gives prospectors

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,059
allowing many other external projects

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,399
other communities to use some of the

00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:44,910
social environments built within code

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,559
you know like social media platforms

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,809
basically the discussion forums within

00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,329
coding in customized way excellent but

00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,999
I'm still kind of you know curious that

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,890
what exactly is good you know is your

00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:59,170
project is it a platform isn't a

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,170
community I just just explain that part

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,860
of it Cordy no is basically social

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,110
networking community that takes into the

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,049
account of only social environment

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,329
projects like the donut project the code

00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,220
batch project and the space fairy

00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:17,259
project I got it excellent so so

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,479
basically it's like an open source

00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:22,420
community that is creating software

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,869
targeted at social networking solutions

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,360
well we we just make up these softwares

00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:31,090
right so we have projects which which

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,460
any any any other external communities

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,140
any other projects can use those

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,869
platforms in their own way

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,990
so we just provide a set of projects a

00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:43,329
set of software the open source tools to

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,399
make it available for the other external

00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:47,020
projects other communities too and and

00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,850
those things can be used in the

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,280
customized way since it's open source

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,990
and it's free Excel now you mention

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,689
three projects one of the projects that

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,179
I am personally interested in is project

00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:01,270
donut tell us a bit more about a donut

00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:03,820
project okay so donut is basically an

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,490
open source feature rich and highly

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,380
privacy friendly social media platform

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,690
so it is it is not basically a

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,230
replication of the Facebook but it is

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,069
the own built diversion of the the

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,540
social media player

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,879
from that that has been built for the

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,519
Community Oriented collaborations in in

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,290
a customized way so it's basically built

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,200
on the north just framework that helps

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:29,109
the other communities to set up like

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,480
it's a self-hosted project right so this

00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,459
helps the external communities external

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,870
projects to set up this on their own

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,810
server and use it for their own

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,480
community so this will act as a bridge

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,150
between the their projects and there are

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,499
users of the community so this is

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,939
basically a kind of social media

00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:48,099
platform and and this comes with

00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:50,799
expensive set of library of modules

00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:53,169
where you can even customize with some

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,659
external like we have mentioned we have

00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:58,060
a appropriate mechanism inside this

00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,659
donut platform where you can organize

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,519
you can create more more features

00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:05,049
related stuff inside the donut platform

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,680
we sell with with one-click so this is

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:11,230
something which even helps you to create

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,090
your own features like like basic

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,159
features functionalities inside the

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,010
donut platform no if you look at history

00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,319
there have been many efforts to create

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,549
open source solutions for social

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,409
networking

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,659
I mean Mastodon is a very good example

00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:29,169
which did not get the kind of traction

00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:32,620
we expected it to get so how different

00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:34,689
is donut from these open source efforts

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,519
the world we currently live in is full

00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:39,129
of jarring technologies and with each

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,930
passing day new software or a gadget is

00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,120
brought into the market which tends to

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,030
improve the people life in one or the

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,810
other way communication technology has

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,299
enabled new approaches to do to the

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,310
common external formalities projects and

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,250
end-users in which stakeholders across

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,379
various sectors are engaged in consensus

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,840
building and and basically

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:06,699
implementation process so basically this

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:10,840
donut project involves like and allows

00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:14,530
the users to click pass through some of

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,930
the platform where you can have the

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,389
one-on-one interaction with video with

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,300
their own community so this is basically

00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,060
a platform which would help the bridge

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,949
the gap between the communities their

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,600
own workings their own working ethics

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,030
and and

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,520
Gertrud users which which gets involved

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,560
with the committee's because for every

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,690
open-source community or every open

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,360
source projects the most prioritized

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,670
thing is the their users right so and

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,350
every community usually like within the

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,480
open source is basically depends upon

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,430
the contribution they receive from the

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,500
external users so I think like this is

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,300
something which would help engage the

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,010
external users as well with your

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,590
projects and and they would be able to

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,680
organize their own stuff on this

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,770
particular self self hosted version of

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,380
their own donut on the server so so this

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,600
is something which will act as a two

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,490
side of the Facebook network which is

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,470
which is a social media platform okay so

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,310
if I'm not wrong you're not building an

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,230
X okay so if I'm not wrong you're not

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,880
building the next method on you're not

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,910
building the next Facebook or Twitter

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,520
you're actually building open-source

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,100
kind of social media solution or

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,620
software that others can leverage to

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,340
build a social network for their own

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,190
needs

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,320
is it correct yes we we are building a

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,760
kind of a software that people can be

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,220
benefited from it now I got it

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,650
so who is the target audience of donut

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,380
if I'm not wrong you seem to be looking

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,560
at business-to-business or b2b space and

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,570
not add business to consumer or b2c

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,180
species there correct okay so basically

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,970
if I talk about the targeted audience so

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,190
targeted audience in sense like this is

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,870
available to the the communities I

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,180
suppose if I talk about a Linux

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,720
Foundation community it's it has got a

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,360
quite a lot of huge users right so so to

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,610
sustain those users with with with their

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,910
own communities and and to keep them

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,340
updated about this stuff or the engage

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,530
them with the external stuff like the

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,600
media or or even like the projects

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,910
events and others things so this is

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,310
something which would help engage the

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,980
both the external communities as well

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,440
and and as well as the targeted users

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,180
for those particular communities and you

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,310
have also been accepted into google

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,380
Summer of Code what has been their

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,940
experience so far oh that is really

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,410
interesting even because we are

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,180
currently in a phase of Google Summer of

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,289
cordyceps so basically we have been

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,659
serving around with many

00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,909
major development programs like Google

00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,520
Summer of Code google code-in google

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:50,930
seasonal dogs and even now as i just

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,240
mentioned like b are currently in the

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,749
phase of google Summer of Code are 2020

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,270
so so I think like participation through

00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,550
these programs have enabled us to grow

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,919
our community of various developers and

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,259
other activists and I think that being a

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,240
social networking community it will be

00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,069
cell social need to interact with

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,680
various at the activists and like

00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:15,199
researchers designers and you like their

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,449
developers across the globe so basically

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,819
the these are the Platte these are the

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,649
basically platforms for the open source

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,899
community and this basically is a

00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:26,629
contest which is organized by the Google

00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:28,759
so so where will you get a chance to

00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,649
interact with the developers and we seek

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,050
to ella parts to who could work on our

00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,749
exciting project so this is something we

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,389
seek some kind of contribution from from

00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:40,399
those two elephant programs I also want

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,559
to know a bit about how wide is spread

00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,959
is the community I do understand that it

00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:47,449
originated from India but tell us a bit

00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,189
about where its developers are is it

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,649
especially to regional or it's a global

00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:53,539
phenomenon oh well this is this is

00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,519
something not really restricted to our

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,279
country so this is something globally

00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,909
present so anyone who feels to like

00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,439
anyone who wants to join we have a

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,809
appropriate like ways of communicating

00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,459
and ways of joining within the community

00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,009
and contribute within the community so

00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,509
so it's all open to the all people

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,789
across the globe no I'm gonna take a

00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,819
step back I understand a lot about the

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:20,809
project I want to I want to know the

00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:23,240
story why and then you got the idea to

00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:26,119
create this project what problem you saw

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,729
in this market that you wanted to solve

00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:30,830
with it oh well I I just wanted to know

00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,289
like when when I started with this

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,050
project I was around like 14 years old

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:38,569
and and the major problem for me was to

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,550
seek some contribution like like how to

00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:42,949
basically set up the foundation for this

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,019
particular project because because you

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:47,120
know like I actually got to know about

00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,800
the open source stuff from the one of

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,470
the contests by the Google which is

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,720
named as google code-in and after that

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,209
it it really made me to research about

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,829
like how social media plan

00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,779
forms are made like how about Twitter's

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,309
have Facebook and made so I was

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,259
wondering like how about if every

00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:06,139
community and every project have their

00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,850
own Facebook so this is something which

00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:10,100
which helped me which motivated me

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,779
because I I was I started researching

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,399
out I started brainstorming around like

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,019
by there is a need of social

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,779
environments while there is a need of a

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,619
community bridge between their users by

00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:23,899
actually there's a need of you know like

00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:25,850
basically the sustainability within any

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,029
comment or any project so this this

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,949
actually motivated and encouraged me to

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:33,649
start with these particular projects and

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:36,589
and with the dis growing projects we had

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,420
a chance to integrate the other other

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,309
projects as well like discussion forums

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,290
or with this social media platform Andy

00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:44,480
and the project which mazes the help of

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,699
the user so so you so it's all about

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,740
like getting all in in one place so yeah

00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,629
and even even more more mentally like

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,029
this these type of project doesn't exist

00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,610
for now because not not really in the

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,199
open-source communities like open

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,110
suppose ecosystem so this is something

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:02,470
we would be the first community like we

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,209
are solving these these particular

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,459
platforms and particular projects for

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,049
external users and communities to use in

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,240
their own way now what are the critical

00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,790
piece of any project especially open

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,679
source project is funding so how are you

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,619
funding or is sponsoring their project

00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,119
well for now we don't have enough

00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,759
funding like we don't receive enough

00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,799
funding for now about whatever the

00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,980
funding we receive are basically from

00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,720
the development programs and anyone like

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,160
like I just had like google Summer of

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,519
Code and those are the things like they

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,049
usually pays like they support some open

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,549
source communities who took part States

00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:42,740
so this this basically we are even like

00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:46,459
looking forward to have a financially

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,410
support from the communities some large

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,379
based communities and where we could

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,629
help grow our market we could have grow

00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,699
our development phase so this is

00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:57,410
something even now if I talk about I

00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,269
would really like to thank a Linux

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,540
Foundation because this the Linux

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:06,410
Foundation recently is supporting us and

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,509
even we got approved for a new leg link

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,130
for a Linux foundations new community

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,630
bridge mentorship program

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,920
we're very cool to know is participating

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,170
with me too many so I think this is

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,720
something we are really excited about

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,580
right that's reality but if you look at

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,980
open source commercialization of open

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,830
source is critical to the health of the

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,980
project and its ecosystem it is sure

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,480
that the project has some longevity do

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,040
you have any plans to commercialize

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,800
donut Oh

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,870
basically yes because currently we have

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,180
lots of goals you know like we are

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,730
currently in a phase off to making this

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,580
freeze to some external markets as well

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,190
making it making it more viable product

00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,740
at a production level and and we are

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,690
heavily working on this this donut

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,940
platform and another interlink project

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,340
star to have a security and wasn't a bit

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,090
please let it stop you know like because

00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:02,300
if any communities use this platform for

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,520
their own like for on yourself so so the

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,620
very first priority would be to have

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,720
that security right so so security and

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,310
the privacy pay is the most important

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,770
part for any commenting so this is

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,270
something we are really trying to build

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,010
on and really trying to make it more

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,470
secure so that this could be reached to

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,450
the major production level and and this

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,520
could be used by many other comedies and

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,250
projects great now if you're in the

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,460
middle of 2020 oh can you talk about

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:31,190
what does your roadmap for the year look

00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,010
like basically the very first priority

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,050
for us would be to seek some funding

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,940
from the communities and you from the

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,340
projects because funding plays a vital

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,580
role for our for our because you know

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,120
like we have to because for basically

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,620
for any open source community or project

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,510
they usually depends upon the

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,160
contributions they receive from the

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,620
external users and and those are you

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,930
know like they're usually freely freely

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,670
paid not not really paid so basically to

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,070
that free so so this is something like

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,900
which would help us to enable and get

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,710
into the markets and organize some kind

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
of meetups

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,630
organize some of development sprints

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,670
online hackathons where we could

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,650
introduce the project and we could have

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,750
the you know like better improvements

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,630
inside the platforms we are working on

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,150
the other thing I include is the going

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,040
around with the white a wide scope for

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,600
for the current scenario like like if I

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,060
talk about the artificial intelligence

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,779
please he's playing a really a great

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:34,160
importance in every project so yeah so I

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:37,730
think like adding a ie to projects would

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,259
even enable us to seek some more you

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,709
know like the growth so this is

00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,720
something we really plans to like we had

00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:47,630
plans to do this in particular this year

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,449
that was great thank you just grabbed

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,480
for taking time out and talking to me

00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:55,940
today a good luck video project and I I

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,790
look forward to talk to you again once

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:02,800
we heat some of those milestones on your

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,800
