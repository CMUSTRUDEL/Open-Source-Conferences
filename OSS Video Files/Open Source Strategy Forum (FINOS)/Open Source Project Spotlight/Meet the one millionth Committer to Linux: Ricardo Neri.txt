hi this is on behalf of the linux

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,000
foundation and today we have with us

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
ricardo neri a linux kernel engineer at

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
intel ricardo first of all

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,519
welcome to the show and also

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
congratulations

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
for for your code contribution that has

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
become one millionth contribution to the

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,960
linux kernel

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,800
hi thank you thank you very much ricardo

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,680
so first of all tell us a bit about

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,840
yourself

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,800
your journey when was the first time you

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,160
came in contact with open source or

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,360
linux in in general uh that was

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,040
i think in 2008

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,920
uh at the time uh yeah i started i

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,640
i it was a time when the ice the iphone

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,680
came out

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,680
and yeah at the time i u

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,760
i used to work in simbian but then

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,360
because of the iphone came out

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
symbian sort of died so i was

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,320
transferred to a new team

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
which has which was working on audio

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
drivers

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,800
for linux and uh yeah so i

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
maybe by chance i landed on that team

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
and that that's how it started

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,400
12 years ago you had a personal

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
interaction with the kernel community

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
how was that interaction it was very

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
daunting because i had

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
i have heard her that it was really hard

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,560
to convince maintainers

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,720
uh to take your code and also

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
i don't know maybe intimidating because

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,439
the people in the community

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,880
was very smart and also they had strong

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,759
opinions uh

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,600
for various things so yeah maybe i'd say

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
it was intimidating but exciting at the

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,840
same time

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,439
and also it was a new world

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,759
to me so yeah i'd say

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,000
it was a good it was interesting but

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,159
also intimidating i'd say

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,479
you have been involved since as you said

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
you know iphone days or 2007 or six

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,280
whatever the year was

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,880
how have you seen the the community i'm

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
not talking about the kernel the project

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
itself i'm talking with the community

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
how have you seen

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,040
the community itself evolved over time

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,399
just building on

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
on my previous comment uh i saw at a

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,560
time that

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,959
maintainers they they

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
care deeply about the quality of the

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
code

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
and that maybe dropped them to make

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
harsh comments

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,360
on on on on the on

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
code from people and maybe that was like

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
a sort of a barrier

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,599
for new people to start contributing but

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
i have seen a change in the last

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
years in which there have been things

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,080
such as

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,280
new codes of conduct and uh

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,680
yeah rules that are agreed up upon

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
for people to maybe to if they are

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
hesitant or they

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,959
are uh not so sure about the quality of

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,480
their code just to take it

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,120
out there and uh maybe not they will not

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,599
have they will not have a such a harsh

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
reply as they it used to be in the in

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,760
the early years when i joined

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
the open source open source community so

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
i think that

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
that is a change that i have observed

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
another change that

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,080
i i have of service is more companies

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
embracing open source because at the

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,959
time

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,239
uh the industry was still dominated by

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,680
closed source uh software

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,959
but now i have seen companies building

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
more and more

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
business model around open source

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,760
software in which the value of the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,799
of the product is not the software of

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,280
the things that

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,920
that you do with it what role do you

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
think linux has played

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,120
in kind of as you're talking about

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,599
proprietary software

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,879
in kind of democratizing software

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,000
development where

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,400
you don't have to prove yourself before

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,159
you get involved like you you you send a

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,840
patch if the patch is good

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,280
if the linux direct they will take your

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
patch if it's not good they will not

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
take it

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
they don't have to look at your resume

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,720
or cv that hey have you done any work

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,720
before or not

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
so how much role has linus played in

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
kind of democratic software development

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
itself

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
yeah i think it has it has played a big

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,920
role because as you say

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
you don't have to have a college degree

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,040
or a computer science degree to start

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,440
contributing to it because the currency

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
as you say is a quality of code so i

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,199
have seen

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,440
i myself i am not a a computer

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,000
scientist or a software engineer my

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,000
background is electrical engineer

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
so probably i can be a good example of

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
that i didn't need to

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
go to college for five years and still

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
study computer science to start

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,120
contributing anyone can

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,120
with the interest and to learn and to

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
do something can start growing tv

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,040
contributing

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,520
um and and and i see you uh

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
and i am new i am not the other the only

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
example there are other people that i

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,440
see that i have for instance they have a

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,280
biology degrees and by i don't know

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,479
their life through them through this

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,840
pattern they have

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,800
they now have become key contributors to

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,240
to linda so i it it is as you say you

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
can just

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
go to the linux kernel mailing list read

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,440
the patches maybe contribute your own

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
reviews and maybe start sending your

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,320
password all you need is essentially

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
a workstation with the compiler and the

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,000
source code and

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
you can find a book or an improvement

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and and you can just

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,800
just do it you don't need anything more

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
on that

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,479
have you attended any of these linux uh

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,199
plumbing or any other

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
conferences and events uh yes actually i

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
was

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
just attending the linux plumbers

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
conference a few hours ago

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,039
i was in the power management micro

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,560
conference

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,800
and uh yes and in previous years i have

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
also been attending linuxcon

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,479
which what used to be linuxcon which is

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,919
now the open source

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,080
open source summit and yeah so i

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,919
i have been every now and then in those

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,919
events so as you said you know that when

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,600
you interact with the kernel community

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,880
over email you know it hit a bit

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,919
daunting and you

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,759
you felt intimidated because you know i

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,759
you don't know how they will respond to

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
the patch but when you go and meet these

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,759
developers in person

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,520
when you sit down for either breakfast

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
or for beer in the evening

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,680
you certainly find that they are as

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,880
humane as we are

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,720
so when you meet them in person how

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
does chemistry that trust their

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
relationship changes yeah

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
that is that is very true because yeah

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,520
as you say

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,319
when you read only only

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
if you interact with these people only

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,840
through the mailing list

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,240
you can only see written words without

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,160
any context of it and as you say

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,319
they can this can this is prone to

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
misinterpretation on both sides

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
but actually as you say when you when

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,240
you meet with them in

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,680
maybe in a virtual event or in person

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
you see that they are actually

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,080
friendly so as i say they do care about

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,639
the quality of the code

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
but they are approachable and trendy in

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,680
my experience

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,560
and that is also the experience that i

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,759
have heard from all of my co-workers who

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,960
are also

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,840
sort of new to the to the to this

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
community

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
they they they have the same similar

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
feedback as i do

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
we have talked about the community we

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
have talked about let's talk about your

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
contribution

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,360
what was this uh code contribution that

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
historically became one millionth

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
contribution talk about that

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
code that is that is related to the work

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,479
that i

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,919
that i do with intel in which i am

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,919
part of the cpu enabling

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,639
team in which whenever intel comes up

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,160
with a new feature in the processor

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,639
uh the theme to which i belong uh

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
irresponsible of taking that in feature

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,039
and make it

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,720
consumable by the linux kernel so in

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,960
this particular case

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
we were this for this is for a new

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,960
instruction called serialize

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,280
which essentially uh

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
serialize the execution of the code it

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,240
puts like

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,240
it it puts like a sort of uh

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,599
landmark in which all the execution

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,039
before that that

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,360
that instruction gets done before before

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
starting executing the code after that

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,719
instruction

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,599
and that that is that was solving

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
problems that we had in the past because

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,880
for instance you can

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:44,080
achieve the same goal using

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,880
an extraction called cpu id or

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,560
return from interrupt uh but though that

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,680
those instructions have a certain side

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,000
effects and

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,000
can have also a performance penalty so

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
this serialized instruction

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,240
allows you to as i said

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,080
divide the execution of code without

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,000
having to

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
those side effects that you will need to

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
fix up in in the software so it helps to

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
make the software

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,040
simpler and maybe and you have a

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,880
performance bonus as a result of it as

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,720
well so it was a

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,200
part of a series and uh

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
and also probably i should mention that

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,920
this this

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,360
this patch came us as uh

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,399
we andy duttomerski which is a

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,640
a well-known contributor to linux kernel

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,320
suggested us to use

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
uh this new instruction in a in a code

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
path

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,800
in the kernel in which the the kernel

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,080
needed to

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,240
do this this kind of serialization so

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,000
yeah this patch was part of of that

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,120
series and that maybe is a good example

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
of how the community having so many

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,040
eyes pruning and pruning at the code and

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,240
participating in the mailing list

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,000
you can arrive to into new ideas that

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
you probably didn't have on your own or

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,480
maybe your company alone

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
will not be able to have what role has

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,720
open source

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
played and as we were talking earlier

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,560
that you don't have to prove yourself

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,880
you don't have to you know

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,079
be in a specific region to to get

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,120
involved at the same

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,120
time not only you become a contributor

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
you can also get access to a lot of

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
technologies which may or may not be

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
available wherever you are

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
or whatever your background is so so

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,720
talk about what role has

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
open source played in creating a level

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
playing field in in

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,200
giving access to underrepresented

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,880
minorities and give them not only

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,880
tools but also a voice i i think that

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,680
the yeah

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,920
probably what i what i i it's similar to

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,480
what i was saying in the beginning that

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,000
in the traditional model well not so

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,360
traditional anymore in which

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,399
you have to go to college and uh

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,279
and then spend four years there and not

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
work and

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,320
have good grades all of that you need to

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,480
have

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,760
certain opportunities in life

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,440
to be able to do that to

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,040
have the luxury of attending college for

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,399
five years and and

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,800
and gain a degree

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,760
what is in software for instance you you

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,160
you don't need that

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,160
all you need is to the willingness and

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,320
the on the

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,519
yeah yes just the willingness of of

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,519
learning and

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,880
contributing to it so i think that uh

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,680
for falls of or under underrepresented

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,640
underpresented minority groups i'd say

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,120
that

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,120
um

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,000
yeah statistically they have a lesser

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,040
chance of attending

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,480
college and gaining a degree so

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,399
and i i i have i have seen also

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
companies realizing the fact that you

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,880
don't actually need to be a computer

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,160
scientist to start writing software so

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
that has

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,519
opened doors for people of different

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
backgrounds

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,519
and very diverse backgrounds in which

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,600
you don't have to

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,720
be part of a certain

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
career path or school but that can then

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,680
can land you a job in this in this

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
industry you can just

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,800
start where whatever you whatever you

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,760
want

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,760
and i also seen efforts

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,680
i think that from genome that they have

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
a scholarships

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,240
to help to recruit people from

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
underrepresented groups

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,279
to start contributing and they get

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,279
mentoring

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,079
because that does that is an important

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,480
point the software is

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,800
is is free and anyone can contribute to

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,920
it but if you have a mentor if you have

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,959
someone that can help you

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,880
how to navigate the uh uh

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,079
an open source software community it

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,920
will help you a lot and

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,800
it will go a long way to

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,560
to get you established in that community

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,480
you can you can start contributing very

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,079
simple patches but over time

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,959
you have that guidance you can optimize

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,160
your time and your effort to make the

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,040
things that will have an

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,160
impact and will maybe someday make you a

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,760
key contributor

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,160
to the community uh ricardo thank you so

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,240
much

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,200
uh for taking your time out and talking

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,760
about your contribution and also about

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
the the evolution of the community and

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
the project itself

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,959
and once again congratulations for your

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,240
contribution thank you

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,240
