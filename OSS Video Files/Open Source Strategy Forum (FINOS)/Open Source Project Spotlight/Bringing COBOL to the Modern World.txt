Title: Bringing COBOL to the Modern World
Publication date: 2020-09-30
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	COBOL is powering most of the critical infrastructure that involves any kind of monetary transaction. In this special interview conducted during the recent Open Mainframe Summit, we talked about the relevance of COBOL today and the role of the new COBOL working group that was announced at the summit. Joining us were Cameron Seay, Adjunct Professor at East Carolina University and Derek Lisinski of the Application Modernizing Group at Micro Focus. Micro Focus recently joined the Open Mainframe Project and is now also involved with the working group.

	00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,799
today we're going to talk about cobalt

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
and a new cobalt working group that was

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,480
announced at the summit

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,559
microfocus also joined the open

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
mainframe project recently and they are

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,119
now also involved with the working group

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,119
to learn uh more about this working

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,520
group and talk a bit about the relevance

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,560
or importance of cobol in today's world

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,039
today we have with us cam say adjunct

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,519
professor at east carolina university

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
and

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,199
derek britton who works at the

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,320
application modernizing group at

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
microfocus

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
uh first of all cam and direct welcome

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,520
to the show

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
good to be here thanks for having me

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,800
appreciate it if you look at cobol

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,000
it's a very old technology who is

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,840
still using cobalt today uh cam

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,039
i would like to hear your insight first

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
so every large commercial bank i know of

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
uses cobalt every large insurance

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,640
company every large federal agency

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,600
uh every large retailer um

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,080
uses cobalt to some some degree and it

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
processes a large percentage

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,280
of the world's financial transactions

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
for example

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,320
you go to walmart you make a sale that s

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
that that sale that transaction is

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,280
probably recorded with using a cobalt

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,720
program

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
so it's it's used the the a lot a large

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
percentage of the global business is

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
still done in cobalt

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,640
right and if you look at microfocus uh

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
cobol you know microfocus is i think one

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
of the few companies

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,400
who is offering support around cobalt so

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
uh derrick uh as cam rightly said

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,759
but if you can you know kindly say that

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,920
you know that

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,880
these are the some of the industries

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,320
which heavily

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,439
depend on cobalt so it's not technology

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
that has become mentioned

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,640
just like mainframe right every time we

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
make a transaction that is where

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,720
mainframe gets involved so i want to

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,720
you know just tell people the the

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,119
importance of cobalt in today's modern

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,240
world

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,719
well um if we go back uh

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,159
go back in time there weren't that many

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,439
choices on the markets

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
um if you wanted a a robust technology

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,479
to

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
to build your business systems kabul was

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
one of the

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,760
very few choices and so it's surprising

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,040
when there are so many choices around

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,520
today that

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
many of the world's largest industries

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,879
largest organizations still

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,640
rely on cobalt so its importance

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,440
is that actually if kabul

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,360
wasn't being used so many of those

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
systems that people trust and rely on

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,800
whether you're

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
moving money around whether you're

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
running someone's payroll

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
whether you're getting an insurance

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,480
quotation shipping a parcel booking a

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
holiday

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,720
all of these things are happening with

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,319
cobalt at the back end

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
and the value you're getting from that

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,200
is not just that it carries on running

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
but it

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,120
runs with the same results

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,080
again and again and again um without

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
fail

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
and so the importance of cobalt is not

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,959
just its pervasiveness which i think is

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,159
significant and perhaps not that well

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,440
understood

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,560
and but also its reliability

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,280
and because it's wedded very closely to

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
the mainframe environments and to cics

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,239
and some other

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,239
you know core elements of the mainframe

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,760
and other platforms as well

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,879
um it it uses and and

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
trusts a lot of technology that is you

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
know

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,720
unrivaled in terms of its reliability

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
its scalability

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
and its performance and that's why it

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,799
remains so important

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
um to the global economy and to so many

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,080
industries because

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
it does what it needs to do which is

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,680
business processing

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,239
so fantastically well excellent thanks

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
for you know

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
talking about that uh now you guys

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,040
recently joined

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
the the project the foundation as well

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,560
uh

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,920
so talk about you know why you joined

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,159
the open mainframe

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,920
project and what are the projects that

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
you will be involved with of course i

00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
know you are involved with the working

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
group

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,360
but talk about you know dual involvement

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
with the project well our initial

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
interest with the open mainframe project

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,319
goes back a

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
a couple of years we're we're long time

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,480
exponents of

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,319
um of the mainframe platform of course

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,439
here at microfocus i have a range of

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,680
technologies that

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,440
that run on on cos um

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,840
but our interest in the the wider

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,199
mainframe community and now the the open

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,960
mainframe project

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
probably comes as a result of the time

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
we've spent with the the share community

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,080
and other

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,479
ibm sponsored communities where

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
the discussion about the best way to

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,080
embrace

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
this trusted technology you know in the

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
digital era

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,800
um you know this is becoming a very

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
topical conversation

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
and and that's also true for for cobol

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,600
which i'm sure we'll come back to

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
um so mike fox's interest in the omp has

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,199
been going on for

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,280
the last couple of years and we were

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,160
final finally able to to reach an

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
agreement with

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,240
um between both organizations to to join

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
the group

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
this year uh specifically because of a

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,039
number of

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
initiatives that we have going on at

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
microfocus and that a number of

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
our customers have talked to us about

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,680
specifically in the area

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,120
of uh mainframe devops so

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,680
there is a growing desire um as

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,360
as vital as the mainframe platform is

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
there's a growing desire

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
to use it to deliver greater and greater

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
value to the business which typically

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,240
means trying to accelerate

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,400
delivery cycles and get more done and of

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
course now the mainframe is

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,880
so inextricably connected with other

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,479
parts of the the it ecosystem

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
that those points of connection and the

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,720
number of moving parts that have to be

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
um handled uh integrated with

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
and managed you know as part of a

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,840
delivery process you know it's an

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,560
important part of

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,319
our customers roadmap and therefore

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,400
microfocus is roadmap

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
to ensure that they get the very best of

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
technology in the mainframe world

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
whether it's tried and trusted

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
technology whether it's new emerging

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
vendor technology

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
or whether in many cases it becomes uh

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,919
open source technology

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
so we wanted to play our part in those

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,360
kinds of projects and

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
you know a number of initiatives around

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,400
now we have this working group

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,199
there so is there a kind of increase

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
in interest in cobol that we are seeing

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,600
there that now there is a

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
dedicated working group and if you can

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,840
also talk a bit about

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,319
what will be the role of this group so

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
so

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
um if your question was is there an

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
increased interest in

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
working in cobalt because of the working

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,120
group um the working group actually

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,440
became as a result of a renewed interest

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,919
in the written new discovery in cobalt

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,720
and um the governor of new jersey made a

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
comment that

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,479
their unemployment was not

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
able to be processed because of some

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,240
some

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,520
you know some of koval's

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,280
obsolescence or um inefficiency or

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,680
inadequacy to some degree

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,039
and that that sparked quite a furore in

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
the mainframe world because

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,520
it wasn't cobalt at all cobalt had

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
nothing to do with the the inability of

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,960
new jersey

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,680
to um deliver the unemployment checks

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,800
um further we're aware that new jersey

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
is just typical

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
of every state every state that i know

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
of uh there may be some exceptions i'm

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,840
not aware of any i know

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
it's certainly true for california new

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,520
york is dependent upon cobalt

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,440
to process their day-to-day business

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,520
applications so

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
then derek and some other people inside

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,560
the omp

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,319
got together and said you know we

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
started having some conversations myself

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,520
included

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
uh we maybe need to form a cobalt

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,840
working group

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,160
so uh to to to renew

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
this interest in cobol and and establish

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,800
the facts around cobalt

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,800
so that's kind of what the working group

00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
is trying to do and we're we're trying

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
to

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,120
increase that um familiarity visibility

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,560
and interest in cobol then i want to

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
bring the same question to you

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,280
also is that uh is there any particular

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,360
reason that we are seeing

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,199
interest increase in interest in cobol

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
and what is that reason yeah that's a

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
great question and i think there are a

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,919
few reasons

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
um i mean first of all and i think

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,400
that's the

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
really important milestone for cobalt

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
was

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,560
was actually last year when it turned 60

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,680
years old

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,120
and i think one of your earlier

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,640
questions uh related to cole's age being

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,440
60. so um yeah of course

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,240
kobold isn't a 60 year old language the

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,240
idea is

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,480
60 is old for sure um but if you drive a

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,480
20 20 motor car

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
you know you're driving a 20 20 motor

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,040
car you're not driving a

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
100 odd year old idea and no one thinks

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,959
as a

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,560
modern telephone as an old idea either

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,040
um it's not old technology sorry

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,800
the idea might be from a long time ago

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,959
but the technology has advanced

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
and the same thing is true in code um

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,279
but when we celebrated

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
the cable's 60th anniversary last year a

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
few of the vendors did and a number of

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,720
organizations did too

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,800
there was a um an outpouring

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
of interest in the technology because i

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,560
think you know

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
a lot of times cobol just quietly goes

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,240
about its business of running the

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
world's economy without any fuss

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
like i say it's very very reliable it

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,120
never really breaks

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
um so there's never anything to talk

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
about um

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,240
so people were sort of pleasantly

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
surprised i think in many cases to learn

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
of its age

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,200
to learn of the the age of the idea now

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,680
of course

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,040
uh microfocus and ibm and and some of

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
the other vendors will you know they

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
continue to update

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
and adapt cobalt so that it continues to

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,760
evolve and be relevant

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,519
today so it's actually a 2020 technology

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,160
rather than 1961 but that was the first

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,440
one secondly

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
the pandemic caused a lot of businesses

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
to

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,160
have to change how they process court

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,360
systems how they how they interact with

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,959
their customers

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,959
and some of the time that put extra

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,200
strain on certain organizations or

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,320
certain government agencies

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,880
and and in a couple of cases kerbal was

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
i believe

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,399
incorrectly um

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
made the scapegoat for some of the

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,680
challenges that those organizations face

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,920
whether it was a skills issue

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,200
or whether it was a technology issue

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,320
under the covers actually

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
the cobol was working just fine um so

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,079
the interest has been

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
positive regarding the anniversary but

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,079
sometimes

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,000
um i think the the the reports have been

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
inaccurate and and perhaps a little

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,880
unkind

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,640
uh about cohort more recently and

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,720
and they were the two reasons they came

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
together and i remember when i

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,560
first spoke to to cam and to some of the

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,880
other people on the

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
on the working group he said it was it

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
was a very good idea

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
once and for all that we told the truth

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,600
about carmel that the industry

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,720
finally understood um how viable it is

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,240
how valuable it is

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,200
based on the facts um behind

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,200
kobold's usage so one of the things

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
we're going to do is it is trying to

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,320
quantify and qualify

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,519
as best we can how widely coble is used

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,720
what it's used for who who is using it

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,720
and then you know present a more factual

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,640
story about the technology so that

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,760
people can make a more informed

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,120
decision about technical strategy

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,600
rather than base it on hearsay or

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,079
you know some some reputation about

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,720
something being a bit dusty and outdated

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:56,079
which is probably a reputation

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,839
that's being uh espoused by you know

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,000
someone who would have you replace it

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,519
with something else

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
and you know their motivation might be

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,160
for different reasons there's nothing

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,360
wrong with cobalt

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,920
and it's very very viable and so our job

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
i think really is to is to tell that

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
truth

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,160
and make sure people understand it what

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,040
other projects

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,079
or efforts or initiatives are uh going

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,079
on there at

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
either linux foundation or open main

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,160
frame project

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,519
around cobalt can you talk about that uh

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,639
well certainly so

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
there is concurrently uh a course being

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,279
developed

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,519
by sudharshna srinivasan um

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,959
and i think um let's get the other

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,040
gentleman involved there's another she

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,240
has a partner there that they develop

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,839
an online course uh in cobalt right so

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
it's the rudiments of it it's for

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,959
novices

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,079
but it is and it's great for continuing

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,360
education program

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,600
so that's one of the things going on

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,399
around cobalt another thing is

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
um there's a lot going on in mainframe

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
development

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,160
in the omp now so there's a an

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,399
application framework that's been

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,800
developed called zoe that will allow you

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,600
to develop applications for z os

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
and it's interesting the the the uh

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
focus of

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
the open mainframe project when it first

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,079
began was linux on the mainframe

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,120
but actually the first real project that

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,279
came out of it

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,320
uh was um a z os based uh product zoe

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,920
and um so we're interested in that too

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,160
those are just a couple of peripheral

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,920
projects around that the um

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
open uh the cobalt working group is

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,639
going to work with i think fundamentally

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
i mean our first step is is i agree with

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
derek there are other things we want to

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,560
do

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,079
uh from from a curriculum standpoint

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
down the road but

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,440
fundamentally we just want to be a

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,240
fact-finding fact-gathering

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,199
um operation first of all and derek has

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,600
really led taking

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,120
taking leadership and putting together a

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
substantial reference list

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,399
so we can we can get the facts about

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,760
cobalt then we're going to do other

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,880
things but that we want to get that

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,440
right first

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,600
so uh there are like you know as you

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
mentioned couple of products so

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,120
is there any overlap between these

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
projects or how different they are

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
like they all serve a different purpose

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,399
because sometimes it looks like

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,760
when you're explaining the the goal and

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,320
role of working group

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,760
that sounds more or less like also the

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,079
that you know

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
that uh training or education group is

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,519
also kind of

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,800
same kind of activities so uh okay let

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
me rephrase it properly

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,120
what are some of the pressing needs that

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,519
you see for the kobold community

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
and how these efforts these groups are

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,199
trying to help them

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
uh and how at the same time they are not

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
overlapping or stepping on each other's

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
toes

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
yeah well and that that's not an ongoing

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,760
thing uh um

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,639
um sudharshan and i really work hard to

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
make sure

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,040
that we're not working at either across

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
purposes or there's duplication of

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,000
effort so

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,959
we're kind of clear about the roles of

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
each of us

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,920
um but um we really for the for the

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,760
the world at large for the public at

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
large the the working group and there

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
can

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
you may have a different view on this

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,160
because we all don't think alike

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
um we all don't see this thing exactly

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,839
the same but i see it as

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
information first okay we want people to

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
get accurate

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
current information about cobalt then we

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,240
want to

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,720
provide some vehicle that cobalt can be

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,040
reintroduced

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,560
back into the general academic

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
curriculum because it used to be i

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
studied cobol at a four-year university

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
right

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,000
most people did when they when they took

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
programming in the 80s and the 90s they

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
said

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,000
they at least the early 90s they took

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,839
cobalt but that's not true anymore

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
our cobalt course in east carolina this

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
semester is the only cobalt course in

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,720
the entire

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,000
unc system so that's got to change

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,399
that's got to change um

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,639
so information um exposure

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,079
accurate information exposure and some

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,000
kind of return to the

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,360
the general curriculum so those are

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
three things that we

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
see that we can services we can provide

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,040
to the community at large

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
derek uh what role do you i mean because

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,399
if you look at microfocus you know

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,839
you are working in the industry you are

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
actually solving the problem for your

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,600
customers

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,800
what role do these groups or or other

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,800
efforts that are going

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,839
on there uh play for the whole ecosystem

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,920
well i think if uh if we go back to

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
cam's answer i think he's absolutely

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,959
right that's the

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,680
um the the industry if you project

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
forward

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,639
another generation in 25 years time

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,000
who are going to be managing these core

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,120
business systems that

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
currently and will still need to uh run

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
the

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
world's largest organizations um now i

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,959
know we're in a digital era and i know

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,240
that things are changing

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,959
you know at an unprecedented pace

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
but most of the world's largest

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
organizations most successful

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,560
organizations still want to be

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,759
in those positions in a generation to

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,279
come

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,839
so who is it who are those practitioners

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
that are coming through the education

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,720
system

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
right now who are going to be leaders in

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
those organizations

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,880
um i.t departments

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,160
in the future uh and there is

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,400
a concern um not just for cobalt but

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,679
actually you know many it skills

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,079
across the board is there going to be

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,240
enough talent to actually run the

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,799
organizations of the future

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,959
um and that's true it's it's you know

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,520
it's a it's a true question mark about

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,559
cobalt

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,600
and so microfocus which has

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,720
its own academic initiative and its own

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,679
training program as does ibm

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
as do many of the other vendors um we

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,600
all

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,480
applaud the work of uh

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,000
any community groups the omp is

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,840
obviously a fabulous example because

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,480
it's genuinely an

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,400
open group generally genuinely it's a

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
meritocracy of people with good ideas

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,600
coming together to try to do the right

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,120
thing

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,240
um we applaud the efforts to ensure

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,160
that there continues to be enough supply

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
of talented i.t professionals in the

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,840
future to meet

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,600
the growing and growing demand you know

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
i.t is not going away it's going to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
become

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,240
strategically more and more important to

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,280
these organizations

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,200
so our part to play is is really

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
you know because microfocus is shoulder

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
to shoulder with organizations like the

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
omp

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,960
because actually between us we will

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,320
create enough

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,200
grand swell of training and opportunity

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
for that next generation um but i think

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,559
you know there's

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,600
still a lot more to do as many people

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,200
will tell you

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,880
there just isn't enough of that training

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,799
going on and there aren't enough of

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,320
those opportunities available

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,320
uh even though

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
one survey that microfocus ran last year

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
on the back of the cobalt 60th

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,120
anniversary

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,039
suggests that 92 or something percent

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,400
of all application owners of cobalt

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,240
systems

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,200
uh confirmed that those applications

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,799
remain strategic to their organizations

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
so if the applications are not going

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,640
anywhere who's going to be looking after

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,160
them in the next generation

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,720
and that's the real challenge that i

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,280
think the the industry faces as a whole

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,320
which is why microfocus uh you know so

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,160
committed to

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,919
you know put our shoulder behind the

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,039
wheel making sure that we can make a

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,760
difference

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,880
as we discussed that you know the

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
interest in cobol

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,400
increasing cobalt is playing a very

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,880
critical role in modern economy

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
what kind of future do you see for

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
kobold where do you see

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
it's going i mean it's been around for

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,200
60 years so it knows

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
how to survive through times but still

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
you know where do you see it grow camp i

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,760
would love to start with you

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,480
uh yeah absolutely i mean i don't we

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
are estimating trying to estimate how

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,080
much cobalt is actually

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,559
used that estimate is running into

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,600
hundreds of billions of lines of code

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,720
and i know you know that for example

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
bank of america

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,000
admits to at least 50 million lines of

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,160
cobalt code

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
that's a lot of cobalt and you're not

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,159
going to replace it

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
over time there's no reason to so i see

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,280
it here

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,480
the the this is the solution to this

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
problem and this is what we're going to

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,640
do

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,400
we're going to figure out a way to teach

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,440
people cobalt because it's not a complex

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,559
language to learn

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,520
and anybody that any organization

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,080
that sees lack of cobol skills as an

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
impediment

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,000
and justification to move to another

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
platform well that's kind of a

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
ridiculous

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
solution that's that solution is

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,320
unfeasible if they try to do that

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
they're going to fail because there's

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
too much risk involved too much expense

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
so we're going to figure out a way to

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
begin to teach coke people cobalt again

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,400
i do it

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,960
our cobalt class the full in east

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,919
carolina so that that is the solution to

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
this problem because

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
the code's not going anywhere nor is

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,400
there a reason for it to go anywhere it

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
works

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,159
it's a simple language it's as fast as

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
it needs to be it's as secure as it

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,799
needs to be

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,960
and no one can that i've talked to

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,320
computer scientists all computer

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,799
scientists all over the world

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,440
no one can give me any application

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,960
that's

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,120
any language that's going to work better

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,799
than co-op there may be some that work

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
as good or nearly as good but you're

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,440
going to have to migrate them but

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,120
there's nothing there's

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,960
there's no improvement that you can make

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,880
on these applications from a performance

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,240
standpoint from a security standpoint so

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
the applications are going to stay where

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
they are

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
and we're just going to have to teach

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,559
people cobalt that's the solution that's

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
what's going to happen

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,000
now how and when i don't know but that

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,280
is what's going to happen if you look at

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,440
uh the crisis that we're going through

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,360
almost everything every business is

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,799
moving online to the cloud you know all

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,280
those transactions that people were

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
doing in person are now moving online so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,640
it become critical

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
so from your perspective what kind of

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
feature do you see

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,960
well that's a great question because the

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,200
world is a very very different place to

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,880
how architecture was designed however

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,600
long ago people are still using an

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,520
architecture that you know

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,880
companies of today are not using that

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,200
architecture so there is some

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,919
question mark back what what's kowal's

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
future

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
i agree with cam that anyone who knows

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,640
cobalt is not necessarily

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,559
um not necessarily going to be able to

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,440
throw that away anytime soon

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,039
because frankly it might be difficult it

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
might be easy but that's not really the

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
question

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,039
is is it a good business decision and

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,799
the answer is it's a terrible business

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,000
decision to throw it away

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,919
um but in addition to that i would

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
contend that there are a number of you

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,000
know modern day

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,600
digital use cases where actually the

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
usage of cobol

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,600
is going to increase rather than

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,799
decrease and we know we see this all the

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,679
time with our

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,679
you know larger organizations who are

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,600
using it for you know

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,400
pretty much the whole of the back end of

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,720
their their core business um

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,440
so whether it's a a banking organization

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,440
or an insurer or a logistics company

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,640
what they're trying to do obviously is

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,640
find new

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,600
and exciting business opportunities um

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
but upon which they will be basing their

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,720
core business systems that already run

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,640
most of the business today

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,960
and then trying to use that to adapt to

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,840
enhance to innovate

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:11,120
so there are insurers who are now

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:14,080
selling the insurance quotation system

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,400
to other smaller insurers

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,159
as a service now of course their

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,840
insurance quotation system is probably

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,039
the version that isn't quite as quick as

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
the one that runs

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,159
on their mainframe but they're making

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,559
that available as a service

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,480
to other organizations and banking

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,039
organizations doing much the same thing

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
with

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,159
you know a range of banking services

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
maybe payment systems

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,520
these are all services that can be

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,159
provided

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,919
to other organizations and the same is

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,679
true in the isb market where

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:47,039
really really robust cobol based

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,919
financial services packages erp

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,440
systems which are cobalt-based and now

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,960
being available made available

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,600
as cloud-based as a service packages

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,520
or you know upon other platforms to meet

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,600
new market needs

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,799
and the thing about cobalt is that the

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,720
few people understand is

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
not only is it easy to learn but it's

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,720
easy to

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,840
move to somewhere else so if your client

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,320
is now running linux one

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,919
and it says well now i want to run i

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
want to run these core cobalt business

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,279
systems

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
here too or maybe they've taken a move

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,760
to aix

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
to a power system well the same cobalt

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,640
system

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,000
can be reused replicated

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,120
as necessary which is a you know

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,880
a little known secret about the language

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,799
this goes back to the original design of

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,919
course back in the day there was there

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,960
was no such thing as

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,120
the standard platform in 1960

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,120
there wasn't a single platform that you

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,640
could reasonably rely on that would give

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,760
you a decent answer

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,200
not very quickly anyway um and so cobol

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
specification said

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
in order for us to know that cobalt

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,360
works we have to have the same results

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
compiled on you know running on

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,320
different machines

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,799
it needs to be the same result running

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,200
at the same speed

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,279
and and from that point that's when the

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,559
portability of the cobalt system

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,799
was you know was finally um

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,480
you know it came to life at the first at

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,360
the first home because that's what they

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,480
set out to do

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,400
built that way by design uh cam

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,840
derek thank you so much for taking your

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,880
time out today and

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,320
talk about uh kobold how important it is

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
in today's world and i'm pretty sure

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,559
that in our day you know when we spend

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
our whole day

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,840
some of the activities that we have done

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
online it touches cold ball or is

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,600
powered by google it one pair of the

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
part

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
thanks yeah you're right yeah so thanks

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
for

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,480
for you know just uh reminding us that

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,960
all these technologies that we think

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,960
are gone but no our our lives still

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,320
depend on that and i wish we could have

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,039
done that in person

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,320
sat in the same room and talked but well

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,600
