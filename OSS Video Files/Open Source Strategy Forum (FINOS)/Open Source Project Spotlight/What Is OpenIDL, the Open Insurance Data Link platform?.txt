Title: What Is OpenIDL, the Open Insurance Data Link platform?
Publication date: 2021-06-21
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	OpenIDL is an open-source project created by the American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) to reduce the cost of regulatory reporting for insurance carriers, provide a standardized data repository for analytics, and a connection point for third parties to deliver new applications to members. To learn more about the project, we sat down with Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at Linux Foundation, Joan Zerkovich, Senior Vice President, Operations at American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) and Truman Esmond, Vice President, Membership & Solutions at AAIS.

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
services

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
it's great to have you all on the show

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
today thank you it's great to be here

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
thanks happy to be here thank you

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
today's topic is the open

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
insurance data link platform and project

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,000
brand can you tell us

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
what is it all about well as you know

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,280
the the use of blockchain technology by

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,039
enterprises uh

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
has grown by leaps and bounds over the

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,079
last few years and

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
uh it's touched all sorts of different

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
domains including ones that are very

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,559
regulatory intensive

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
uh such as insurance such as banking

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,320
obviously such as

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
supply chain traceability uh all sorts

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,479
of others uh and

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
uh this is a project that uh aais

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,439
started

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
uh a a couple of years ago actually to

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
help harmonize

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,040
the reporting and the uh and the sharing

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
of data in the insurance industry for

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
the management of risk they'll tell you

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
a lot about it

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
um but what they chose was to use hyper

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,600
ledger fabric

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
as the way to build out a data sharing

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,119
network

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,479
um using some governance principles that

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,600
align very nicely with the kinds of

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
things that we saw

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
as limitations in uh many of the

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,759
deployments out there

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
uh of blockchain technology for

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
enterprise purposes

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,759
where it was really hard to figure out

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,520
what's the governance model what's the

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
way to actually

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,960
come to an agreement on how to run a

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,159
network like this

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
and so we uh decided we would like to

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
help uh

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
in this space of blockchain governance

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
uh we had been talking with ais for the

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,079
last year on how a project like this

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,840
might work

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
and so this is really the linux

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,640
foundation's first step

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,439
into being a consortium focused on

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,320
delivering

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,119
a set of use cases in uh in a particular

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,799
field

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,879
but using an underlying distributed

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,560
ledger to serve those use cases so

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,640
we're really excited about this i would

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
like to know a bit more about the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,560
history and

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
region of open id project and platform

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
aeis

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,640
is an advisory organization in the

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,000
united states and the reason we were

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,920
formed is that

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
insurance is regulated at the state

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,959
level but there needed to be an

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
organization that looked at the national

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,760
level of insurance

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
kind of providing a common set of

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,160
forms and then also collecting data for

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
the regulators to report

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
on a regional and a national basis so

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,239
we've been doing that for about 80 years

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,720
but

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,160
what we're learning now is that we need

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
more data than we

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
collected in the past it needs to be

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,680
broader

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,840
and at the same time more granular but

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
with the concerns around data security

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
it was becoming increasingly difficult

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
to work with the carriers to get the

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
data that we needed

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
and for the the regulators to get the

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
data that they needed so

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
we held some design thinking sessions to

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
bring the regulators and the carriers

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,080
and ais and others together to talk

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
about this problem

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,360
and we came to the conclusion that it is

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,760
the security and privacy of data

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
and the transparency and how that data

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,000
is used

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,480
and looking for a solution uh to provide

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,720
a new platform to the industry

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
we looked at blockchain and found that

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,440
that is a technology that brings that

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,879
security

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,640
privacy and transparency to the

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,000
exchange of information not necessarily

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
data and the way we've done it in the

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
past

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
but how we might use smart contracts to

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
exchange

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,599
information on top of this network so

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,920
with that we started the open idl

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
you mentioned collecting a large amount

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,680
of data

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,200
thanks to uh the proliferation of iot

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
devices smartphones

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
uh so we are uh not only collecting a

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,799
lot of data we are also collecting

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,159
different kind of data

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,040
can you talk about how has what we

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,080
collect

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,000
changed over years and how uh

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,599
companies are using it to offer better

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
premium for example

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,959
in the insurance space or better

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,319
services to

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,720
their customers yes absolutely and our

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,079
member companies the insurance carriers

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,919
in the united states

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,359
are all looking at the ways that they're

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,360
going to use this

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,720
the smart devices the information that

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,160
is there

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,440
not only to monitor risks

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,680
that they cover but also to pay claims

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,040
and this is where with these smart

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
devices

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,440
iot devices it becomes important to have

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
a blockchain network

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,960
in place the carriers ais we don't want

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
to collect

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,400
all of that data be that is being

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
collected by these sensors

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,720
but we do need an immutable record so

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,960
that if a water sensor

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
checks and sees that something did fail

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
at a certain time

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
and an insured files a claim we can

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,120
simplify the claims process

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
by having that information written on a

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
blockchain now we're not there yet with

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,759
the open idle that's not really the

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,759
first use case that we're working on

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
but we do believe that with the

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,440
extension extension of open ideal and

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
other networks

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
that the data that is collected by these

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
iot devices

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,680
really will benefit the insurance

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,840
industry without them having to collect

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
large volumes of data you mentioned a

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,600
risk factor there

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
can you talk about other use cases that

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
you are looking at

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,360
with this platform and project well let

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,120
me cover just briefly the first use case

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
that we tackled but to be really clear

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
it's not the only use case it is the one

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,800
that we started with to

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
prove the concept prove that it works

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
and it also is

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
integrated with our mission as an

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,479
advisory organization

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,120
today in the united states there are

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,639
stat agents that collect data from

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
insurance carriers

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,080
we aggregate that data and we anonymize

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,759
it and we send reports to regulators

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
now that data isn't meeting the need of

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,400
the regulators anymore and we've learned

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,560
that there are there's over a thousand

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,560
reports that get run on an annual basis

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
where data is requested

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
directly from a regulator the regulator

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
requests it from a carrier

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,639
that data gets sent in and additional

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
reports are being produced because the

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,360
stat data

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
that we've traditionally collected is no

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
longer sufficient

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,720
so we tackled that problem is how can we

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,039
improve

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,759
regulatory reporting and at the heart of

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,720
that

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
let's not transfer large volumes of data

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
anymore so

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,639
inherent in the design of open idl is a

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
data store we call it the harmonized

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,759
data store

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,400
and it has some standards for how data

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,800
is held in that harmonized data store

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,360
with that a rig a carrier could put the

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
data in the harmonized data store

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
and prove that they've met the

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
regulatory requirements that the data is

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
there

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,280
then a regulator when they have a new

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,080
question can use the openidl network

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
to ask a question of the carriers we

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,160
would like to create a report

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,759
with this information in it are you

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,599
willing to participate

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
again going towards collaboration and

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,000
less of a

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,840
requirement and the carriers can say yes

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
we'd love to participate in that we're

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,720
going to run

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,639
some processes here internally we're

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
going to run some smart contracts

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,639
we're going to deliver information back

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,080
in an aggregated and anonymized way

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,919
we're not going to transfer huge volumes

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
of files to the regulators we're just

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,280
going to answer the question

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,280
a good example of this is when there's a

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,599
catastrophe in the united states

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,639
the regulators may ask the carriers in a

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,840
state or region

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,360
to send a large volume of data because

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
they want to know what the

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
total insured value is for homes in that

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
area

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,560
they don't really need to transfer all

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,599
that data they just need a response from

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,440
each of the carriers

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,960
what is the total insured value that you

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,280
have in this area

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
one number and so this is where we're

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
trying to improve

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
regulatory reporting by using the

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
harmonized data store holding it as a

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
secure

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720
and private data store using the network

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,479
to then validate that the data is there

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
validate the questions that are asked of

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
the data that's what's actually stored

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
on chain in the network now let's talk

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,879
about the linux foundation this project

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,800
why and when did you decide to move the

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,560
project into the linux foundation

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,560
um well for us openidl

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
was called open ideal from the very

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,000
beginning because we believe in open

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,159
source solutions

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,159
we were always hopeful that we could

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,519
eventually move our project to the linux

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,599
foundation

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
we are trying to change the way the

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
industry

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,399
shares information and to do that in a

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,839
very open platform we wanted the

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,160
technology to be open

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
the data standards to be open and to

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,880
encourage

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,600
the industry to participate in this

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,279
network we heard repeatedly from

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
our member carriers that they're

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,000
concerned about

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
any organization that is forming one of

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
these networks

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
one is they're concerned about

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,560
proprietary solutions they

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,560
were concerned about investing in a

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
technology and a network and then being

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,279
locked in and

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,120
then having few options if any at all

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,040
in terms of the technology that they

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
would like to use and then the pricing

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,560
model would be locked in

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,279
so being open was a high priority for us

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
we formed a not-for-profit around this

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,040
uh

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,160
organization but again we heard from our

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,399
members

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
any not-for-profit can eventually become

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
a for-profit

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
again locking them in to this technology

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
platform

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
so this is why it was so important for

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,320
us to be with the linux foundation

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,200
an organization with a global base

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,279
of participants that really understand

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
what open source means to provide that

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
common infrastructure to an

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,080
industry and that there isn't a risk

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
that when our members invest in the open

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,360
idl

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,640
that it will become a proprietary or a

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
closed network

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,560
by working with the linux foundation we

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,519
are confident that it will remain

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,360
open and available to to grow brand

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,880
linux foundation is now home to a lot of

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,519
different kind of projects

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,040
can you talk about the structure and

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
governance of this project

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,480
there's a very set you know structure

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,880
and governance model

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,079
you know the linux foundation yeah our

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,160
core has been

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,000
open source software i think we've

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
cracked the nut so to speak on how to

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
get companies large and small

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,440
even fierce competitors to work together

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,600
on common software

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,839
when they have common challenges and

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,000
really it's a the case is uh

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
on not just freedom and not just you

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,959
know agency and having the ability for

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
these companies to

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,279
to bend the software to meet their needs

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
but also on cost cutting on on ways to

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,279
uh you know do the things together that

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
you have to do to be in an industry

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
especially when it comes to something

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,079
like regulatory reporting no one

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,839
differentiates their business on

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,320
regulatory reporting right

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
um so so on open source software we know

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,800
that and obviously the development of

00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
the software is a big part of this

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
project

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
we have a code base that has been built

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,399
by aais working with some some of the

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,399
partners

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,839
coming in to bootstrap this um it is

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480
still early days of the project but

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,240
there is

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
running code in that classic rough

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,120
consensus and running code

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,560
kind of iatf frame right but it's about

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
more than code it's also about the

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,160
specifications making sure that there's

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
ways to plug that software in

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
into the backend systems of the

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
insurance carriers

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
it's also about more than just the

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
insurance carriers we have

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,720
several partners involved who are

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,200
technology infrastructure partners

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,480
these are ones who are there to work

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
with the carriers but also potentially

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
work with other

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,640
types of organizations who might plug

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
into this network

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,320
so it's software it's specifications but

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,399
it's also an open network

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
and this is what's kind of new for us

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,880
when you talk about

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,240
open networks i think everyone has

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
different ideas in their head of what

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
that means or what that looks like

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,160
when i think about the governance of an

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,279
open network i think about things like

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
the domain name system

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,519
how did we get to a working global dns

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
system without it

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,120
becoming a function of the un or a

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
function of some other like

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
international body

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
uh but how do we get it through i can

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,000
right and that was by practicing kind of

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,240
minimum viable governance

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,680
at the center of a set of legal

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,639
relationships that bind

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,480
certain anchors in that trust ecosystem

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,160
in the case the domain name system those

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
are the domain name registrars

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,760
right in the case of something like this

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,040
it'll be the carriers and some of the

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,279
other participants in the network

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,160
acting as these trust anchors running

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,560
nodes on the

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
on this network keeping it decentralized

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,200
but decentralized within the bounds of a

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,680
community

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,440
and the governance model we've set up is

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
a pretty straightforward one it's

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
you know how we do governance on open

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
source projects which is it's

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,360
transparent

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,440
it's the door is open you will have to

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,279
be a member of open idl in order to

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,920
stand up a node on the open ideal

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,279
network

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,720
um but we think that's that's

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,079
appropriate because that's a way to bind

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,399
the participants to

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,600
a set of things that go beyond what open

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,519
source software does

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
and there's more information about this

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,880
at the open ideal website

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,800
and and we've also done some writing on

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
what these kinds of open governance

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,079
networks should look like

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,360
but it really is inspired by trying to

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,800
understand what has made

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
open source software work is a

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,320
governance mechanism what has made open

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,600
standards and specifications

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
work uh as a as a process and trying to

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
say look

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,920
we built the most value for everybody

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,600
the more people we can bring into this

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,519
network and the more public we can be

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,519
about it um you just have to balance

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,079
that with the operations

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,440
of a blockchain network which are very

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,079
different from the operations of

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
publishing open source code and and

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
recognizing that we

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
exist in a regulated space with

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
insurance and so many of these other use

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,160
cases and so

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
another a final big part of this is how

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,639
do we involve the regulators

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,240
uh how do we involve other types of

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
government agencies as

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
first class participants in this network

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,519
not to let them dictate the road map or

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,199
dictate the direction

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,560
but to make them feel like they can they

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,000
can perform the role that they need to

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,199
perform in the industry and everybody

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,600
needs them to perform

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,040
in the industry to help manage the risks

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,560
and make sure that

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
everybody everybody's a good actor in

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,360
the ecosystem can you talk a bit about

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
uh

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
i don't want you to get into the

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,880
technical details of the software stack

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,880
but uh what kind of roadmap you have for

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,079
the release of the software

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,079
and since you are heading couple of

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,120
projects at the linux foundation what

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,199
kind of cross pollination do you see

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
within the foundation which will help

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,120
this project because

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,880
it will be leveraging not only a lot of

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,800
software a lot of code

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
but a lot of networking capabilities and

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,320
also infrastructure

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,240
that is being created by other projects

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,880
the software stack at open idle

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
it does include hyperledger fabric uh

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,720
fortuitously

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,399
there is no requirement that they run

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,160
hyperledger technologies or that any

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
linux foundation hosted project

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,399
like open idle decide to to use

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
hyperledger fabric or any other

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,079
hyperledger project it really is up to

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
that community the open ideal

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,519
technical community to decide what the

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,519
rest of their stack is

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,680
but it is a combination of fabric and

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,160
some chain code written specifically for

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
that

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
along with interface code to be able to

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
connect it to back-end systems and query

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
it

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
but also components like mongodb and

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,360
others to implement this

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,040
this harmonized data store so it is a

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,839
stack of technologies um

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,959
and with openidl in the linux foundation

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
ecosystem

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,399
we do plan to connect it to the

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,399
different events that happen

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,600
the hyperledger global forum coming up

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
in june for example

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
at one event is one event open idea

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
we'll be

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,480
presenting at there's other open source

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
summits and and and other

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,959
face-to-face events as well as channels

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
uh uh from social media point of view

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,519
and and

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,279
and pr points of view and like uh as

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,040
well as other related projects

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,399
uh we are we don't have any other

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,440
insurance related projects

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,079
in uh in the linux foundation but

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,839
as you mentioned with ag stack and some

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
of the other more recent projects in

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,680
energy for example uh

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,440
uh and in the financial sector i

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,800
certainly see bridges uh

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
opportunities to build bridges for those

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,320
organizations talk about common

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,399
technologies i mean there's

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,160
a lot of this stack that is inside open

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
ideal is not actually specific

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,079
to insurance and the ability to use it

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
perhaps for information sharing

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
in other industries in climate for

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,360
example uh

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,639
could be really powerful so we're

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,199
certainly going to be looking at how do

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,880
we get some

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,639
some synergy going with other projects

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
under the lf banner or even beyond

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
excellent thanks truman if you can just

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,600
talk about

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,440
of course there is already a kind of you

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
know community around the project but

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
as part of the linux foundation project

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,399
uh what kind of community

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
or ecosystem we can expect around open

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,360
ideal

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,720
as the project grows absolutely so it

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,040
starts really from the core

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,079
data elements which are the policies and

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
claims that are

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,839
in the distributed data network

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,720
supported by open idl

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,560
so each participating carrier as a data

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
owner has this information in their data

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,360
store

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,160
according to the rules of the harmonized

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
data structures

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,320
uh harmonized data store which is not

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
just structure but how it got there and

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,240
that data that exists is trusted for a

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,240
particular purpose so we've got

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
monthly policy and claim data coming

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,600
into the to the store

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,039
that can be that is good enough for

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,039
regulatory reporting

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,720
then at that point it's how we can use

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,280
it so it's the initial case

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,640
is the annual regulatory reporting as

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,880
well as all the data calls there are

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,720
over 1600 that joan mentioned

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
on that our our member carriers are

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
subject to and we're going to basically

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,480
be

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,480
automating those to allow the regulators

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,080
better you know of the ability to get

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,520
better insights to what's happening in

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,880
their markets so they can write better

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,080
policies so we can build better

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,240
insurance products and take

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,720
care of other risk situations where the

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,320
network will expand are the and where

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,080
it's going right away now is you

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
mentioned iot devices which is the

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,679
is definitely coming on the radar but

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,440
the first one the first

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,280
other data owners that are joining the

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
network are the regulators

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
and then as well as the uh catastrophe

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,240
models

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
and the intellectual property folks that

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,840
have either data aggregation

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,480
around geospatial information or

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,320
models for intelligently mapping

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,240
different risks flood crime

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,360
uh you know as well as those how those

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,120
relate to

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,960
other data stores like weather so as the

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,640
storm approaches who's in danger and

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
this is the question like joan said

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,799
where is the risk out there and then as

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
the storm gets closer what can they do

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
to mitigate and then as it passes what

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,559
do they do to

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,320
to clean up and how do they help make

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,280
sure their communities are are solved so

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,880
that's the the the real use case

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
but we're starting to bring in more

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,120
people into the network as

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,760
brian mentioned first-year participants

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
actually in

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,679
in the network not just connecting via

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,120
apis but actually having their

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,080
proprietary information

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,200
be it an algorithm or an aggregated data

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,679
store

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,960
connected as a harmonized data store to

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,200
the broader network

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,039
so that's where the power really comes

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,799
in so now those third-party data stores

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,679
can not only be accountable but they

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,120
also can be incorporated into a very

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,720
dynamic parametric

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,400
and uh and timely experience for

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
the ultimate business of risk transfer

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,559
uh talking about bringing in more

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,960
members

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,039
of course this one is specific to

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,440
americanization but most of the linux

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,520
foundation projects are global uh will

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
the scope of this project be limited to

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
the u.s

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,720
or north america or what about europe or

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,080
other countries can they also benefit

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
but the thing is

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,919
regulatory the requirements are

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
different there i mean europe is very

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,480
very strict when it comes to uh

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,520
privacy and data so can you talk about

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,600
the scope of

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,720
regional scope of this project if i may

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
absolutely and that's

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
one of the uh governance committees we

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
have under open idl is the applications

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,480
governance committee because this the

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,320
what ais the american association of

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,000
insurance services which has

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,080
very you know a specific scope property

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,679
casualty in the united states

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,120
that's what we're using it for but the

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,640
underlying technology and what our

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
members are using it for you know as you

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
look down

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
inside the enterprise and most of them

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,039
are multinational organizations

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,320
uh you know also you know part of large

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,679
re-insurers and they're looking at

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,960
incorporating this into other

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,600
initiatives

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,559
globally because the pattern when you

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,520
boil it down

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,799
is data ownership and and transparency

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
you know without so you can keep the

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,200
data private

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,760
and get the information to the people

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,960
that need it in a timely fashion in a

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,200
trusted way

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
you know according to whatever the trust

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,039
level it is that you need to do it you

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
know

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
you might need to be higher to pay a

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,360
commission or move large amounts of

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,200
money but if you're just going to send

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,720
somebody a notification maybe to

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,080
batten down the hatches maybe that's a

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
little uh you know you'd have to trust

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,320
it quite as far

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,840
so um that's the that's where it's going

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,360
you know from a fundamental standpoint

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,360
internationally we're already looking at

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,000
many use cases that are

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,600
not not just beyond the regulatory part

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,679
of pnc insurance

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,200
but uh but expand into it and certainly

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
as we look at

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
as we built open idl one of the big

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,000
concerns that we were looking to address

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,360
was gdpr

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
certainly that's a challenge when you

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
look at ledger solutions uh you know and

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,000
data on chains we had to get around that

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
and we think we are not getting around

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
it

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
but work uh you know within the context

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,640
of that and and we think we've got

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
really a an ideal privacy solution that

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
can be applied

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,600
to the fundamental technology and

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
connection of networks through the

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
open governance of the linux foundation

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,919
for the purposes of different levels of

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,000
trust

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,760
and the technology being open can follow

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
our model in fact can you know really

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,880
replicate exactly what we've done as

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,799
aeis for pnc regulatory structures

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,880
and you can apply or pivot it either

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,280
into you know neighboring countries

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
or or other um you know communities

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
however you define that yeah well the

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
international question is i i think a

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
really relevant one i mean right now the

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,559
use cases have been

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,360
uh driven by a set of needs from

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,679
uh the u.s regulators and uh carriers

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,159
focused on the us markets but

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,280
insurance is a global phenomenon uh the

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,120
the need to

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,960
share data to manage risk and build

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,039
better models is a global

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,120
concept there are global standards in

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,400
this uh domain that that people are

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,200
operating against and

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,640
i think actually uh shared open source

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,320
software around

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,760
meeting regulatory requirements might

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
actually be a way to help harmonize some

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,280
of those regulatory requirements um

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,760
might be a way to to bring us closer

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,919
together to uh to a safer world so

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,159
um the idealist in me says sure the door

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,039
is open the the pragmatist says you know

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,440
we need to

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,200
uh also be engaging the regulators and

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
uh but also just like demonstrating that

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,960
there's value in this core

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,159
uh approach uh before getting too too

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
broad about it but

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,760
uh i'm always an under promise and over

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,640
delivery kind of guy so uh i'm

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,840
i'm secretly very optimistic that that

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,840
uh this can be a key

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,520
uh force for the global insurance

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,679
industry one quick point

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,039
um something that we get asked a lot is

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,720
how you know what makes open ideal

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
different from other you know consortia

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,679
and blockchain networks

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
and and we kind of touched on it but

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,559
it's really a couple of very key things

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
is that one thing that you mentioned is

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,440
the regulators are first-tier citizens

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,919
with first-tier

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,559
participants in this network and they

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,880
trusted

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,840
to use for existing regulatory

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
infrastructure

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,120
which is required one thing we one

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,559
common refrain we hear

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
across you know really blockchain

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,120
networks of all kinds is that regulators

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,960
are the challenge when we see a

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,880
cryptocurrency we see it in

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,320
you know uh financial transactions and

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,080
all kinds of other things there

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,360
in this case is the regulators have been

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,679
involved in the development

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,559
and are you know again part of the

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
community

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,840
and the network it wasn't developed

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,280
solely by insurers

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
and then the regulators were invited to

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
participate after the fact they were

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
involved in there from the beginning so

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,440
they can trust it they know how

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,120
how it works from a transparent

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,480
perspective and then again the other

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,559
part of it is the

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
the framework within which it operates

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,200
is is already regulatory acceptable and

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,360
that's our role and we're

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
disintermediating ourselves so that

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,559
as joan mentioned our purpose can move

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,799
much faster

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,480
and really solve the the goal of the of

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,120
the industry and those two things make

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
it

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,720
unique being open from the from the

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
bottom up having the regulators

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
as an infrastructure that ties it to a

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,919
regulatory accepted framework

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,840
and then the other thing is that

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,600
actually it's connected to real property

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,360
right you know where we're talking about

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
actual buildings actual businesses

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,520
actual homes actual cars

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,440
actual things that are real with real

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,919
experience that can be

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,840
trusted for you know again an increasing

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,919
variety of purposes

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,960
and the data sources that relate to

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,880
those things

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,559
can be increasingly distributed because

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,039
those you know if you're if you're

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
aggregating data then you're going to be

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,240
less timely as well as a target which

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,679
was fundamentally our situation where we

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,799
didn't we didn't want to be the big

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
aggregation

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,919
of data but we needed information from

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
the

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,360
uh in an aggregate fashion you know

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
these are early days for the project

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,159
still

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
especially in its incarnation as a linux

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,640
foundation project as an open source

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,679
project uh

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
the door is wide open uh to

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,960
all sorts of different directions we can

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,360
head in like any open source project

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,360
uh history is made by those who show up

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,039
so if this is a domain of interest for

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,200
you uh even if it's really just

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,039
understanding how might a blocked an

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,799
open blockchain network like this work

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,120
i i really invite all of you to come to

00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,440
openideal.org

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
uh register your interest join a mailing

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,880
list and

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
uh and get to know us better awesome

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
brian

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,080
joan truman thank you so much for taking

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,720
time out today and talk about uh this

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,720
project

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,159
uh i look forward to talk to you again

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
because i'm sure there will be a lot of

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,520
updates uh about the project

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,400
so thanks for your time today thank you

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,400
swapnal thanks happy to be here thank
