Description: 
	Today every company has to be a software company to be functional in today’s world and open source has become the preferred model for software development. However, many companies still don’t know how to properly engage with the open source communities and code-base. Lack of any strategy towards open source not only keeps companies from taking full advantage of Open Source, but it also exposes their own IP or code-base to many risks, including the violation of Open Source license. Every company that deals with Open Source should have an Open Source Program Office. However, there is no playbook to create one. The Linux Foundation Training & Certification has released a new seven-course, training series entitled “Open Source Management & Strategy”. The course is authored by seasoned Open Source leader  Guy Martin, Executive Director of OASIS Open, an internationally recognized standards development, and open source projects consortium.

hi this is your sophia bharti on behalf

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,359
of linux foundation and today we have

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,200
with us guy martin executive director of

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,519
osu's open so today we are going to

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
discuss the new open source management

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,080
and

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,040
strategy training series from the linux

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,080
foundation which

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,279
you uh authored uh so uh

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,600
i want to know from you uh first of all

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,680
um can you talk about because you have

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,320
been in this field of open source for so

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,560
long

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
tell me what are open source program

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,039
offices

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
and what is the importance and

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,040
significance of these offices in today's

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
world especially event number one

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,879
almost everybody is either consuming or

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,079
using open source

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,600
and number two is that uh

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,760
it is becoming increasingly important to

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
know how to engage with open source

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,079
communities because this is not a

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,559
one-way traffic

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,160
right exactly i mean i think i look at

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,000
open source program offices

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,440
somebody wants to find it as the and it

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,399
may have been our friend nithya ruff

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,440
at comcast as the central nexus where

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
all open source

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
work um is coordinated within an

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,680
organization now that doesn't mean all

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
the work is necessarily done

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,840
in that organization but it's a central

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,680
place where coordination happens around

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
things like compliance around things

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
like it

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,759
like you said interacting with the open

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,960
source community and so

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,479
within that framework i think ospos are

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,640
a reasonably new

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
sort of construct i've actually you know

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,680
obviously run one at

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,680
samsung i ran one at autodesk but in

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,119
in kind of the formality of really

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,640
talking about osbos it's still

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,240
reasonably new i think probably within

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,640
the last 10 years or so

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
and so i think it's a really great way

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,119
to to again

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,079
centralize at least how people uh work

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,520
with open source

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,360
in in organizations but let the work

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,000
potentially be decentralized but have a

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,159
place that is again the central nexus of

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,680
of training and and engagement with the

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
community can you talk about

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
what are the risks you know if a company

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,560
does not have an open source strategy or

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,119
if they don't have an open source

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,119
program

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
what are the risks they might run into

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,560
yeah so the thing is

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,600
you may be able to consume open source

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
effectively as an

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,879
organization for for quite a while but

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,640
eventually

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,879
technology being what it is you're

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
eventually going to run into a situation

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,560
where you have a bug or you ha in the

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
open source project that you're relying

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,959
on or you

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
need a feature that the community is

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,440
unwilling or unable to

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
contribute or fix for you so you have to

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,400
have that strategy for how you

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
effectively contribute back to that

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,519
upstream

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,440
open source project and i've seen in

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,040
places that have been in my career where

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,599
that strategy wasn't in place

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,800
and rather than engaging constructively

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,319
with the community understanding what

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
the community's built

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,480
that that code was just tossed over the

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
wall to say hey i've got this patch or

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,239
i've got this new feature please accept

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,239
it

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
without any sort of strategy for

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,000
engaging effectively with that community

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
and that generally never ends well uh

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
that i've seen it generally ends up

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
being that the community says well

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
either a we fixed that bug in a

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,840
different way or we've implemented that

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,560
feature but we don't want to take your

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,280
fix

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,599
and then you're in this catch-22 of do

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,280
you maintain a long-lived fork of that

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,879
open source project

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,879
and then have to do all the engineering

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,760
with that and then continue to merge

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,720
changes from the

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,480
from that upstream or do you you know

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,159
basically give up on your fix

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,000
use whatever the community built and and

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,760
then do all the regression tests within

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,200
your own product to make it work so

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,799
it's generally better to have that

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,599
strategy up front so that when you get

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,519
to the point

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,959
that you find a bug or you know you're

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
going to need to contribute to that that

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
upstream community and by the way you

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,280
will

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
any executive that says will only ever

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
consume from open source is

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
is really not living in reality the

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,640
reality is at some point

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
you will have to contribute back or

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,319
engage in some constructive way with an

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,360
open source community and so having that

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,879
strategy

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,959
locked in ahead of time makes it a lot

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
easier organizations individuals

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,720
companies who do

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
want to set up open source program

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,040
office or they want to build

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
a strategy for open source in a very

00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,840
structured manner

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,599
i think linux foundation and you have

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,879
collaborated to come up with this

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,159
training course series

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,599
so tell us a bit about this series uh

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
what does it cover

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,920
uh who is the target audience for this

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
course right i mean i think

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
you know this series of courses i was

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
really excited um

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
to to to be asked to build this by the

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
linux foundation and this was actually

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800
kind of concurrent with as i took on my

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,919
new role as the executive director of

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
oasis open which

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,960
i'd love to talk to you about more at

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
some point too but um

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,479
as i took this on i i think i was really

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,199
glad

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,720
to see that it's not even though i'm the

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
the author on the course

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
it's really not just my content it's

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
content obviously that i've

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,120
had over 15 to 18 plus years um

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
running open source program offices but

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,080
it's also content

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
that is really the collective tribal

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,919
knowledge if you will

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
of all of the open source program office

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,919
folks that that

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
are in our community and this course is

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,479
really targeted i think

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,800
at both executives and engineers and and

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,520
really my hope is that at some point

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
this course is something that can help

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,479
build

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
the the bench of people who run open

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320
source program offices because

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
you know i'm really glad to be part of

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,560
that community

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,560
but right now that community is only

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
about 40 or 50 of us in the world

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
we all know each other right which is

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
great but there's a ton of opportunities

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
and there's a ton of organizations

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,240
that need this expertise of people who

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
can help run open source program offices

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
and my desire is that this course is one

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
of those things that

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,639
that you can use to do that so again it

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,720
covers

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,880
um everything in in a structured way

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
that really uh was what i

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
came up with when i worked with my team

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
at red hat which is a strategy

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
a core of strategy and governance the

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
why and how of you of

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,520
of open source or what open source looks

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
like in your organization

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
with modules around how you consume open

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
source how you contribute or collaborate

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
uh with upstream open source communities

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
and how you create open source so

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,600
it's really designed to to look at the

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
whole picture of

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,479
open source from consume contribute

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
collaborate um and create as well as

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,680
the what i call the core muscles right

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
before you do any of those things you i

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
think

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,160
the the key to a good strategy is to

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
have those the core muscles to find of

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
the

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
the why and how right what's your

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
overall strategy and how are you going

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
to

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,240
effectively um work both with the

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,319
upstream community and

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
train your own organization because you

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
and i know swap it's it's a lot of times

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,080
it's a mindset shift

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
it's not just a process shift so um this

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,720
course

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,639
uh is designed this course series is

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
really designed to encompass all of

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
those things

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,960
and i will say that it's designed not to

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,919
be a deep dive necessarily into any of

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
those topics

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,199
it gives a high level overview and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
obviously there's a lot of other

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
training courses that that are out there

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,280
that linux foundation and others have

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,599
already developed

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,960
and so this is i think meant to give the

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,360
holistic view

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,039
at you know a 20 000 foot level that

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
that really lets people kind of

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,639
get started who are these people who can

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,039
benefit from it and

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
what kind of benefit it offers them i

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,960
mean i think it

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
anybody from an engineer who has to do

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,000
the work to

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
a senior leader who has to oversee the

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
work to the

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
the middle management that that is

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
working on these day-to-day things

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,599
i i tried to target this really across

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,520
that spectrum and so not everybody has

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
to take every single module i think

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,960
we tried to design it so that the things

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
like strategy and governance the core

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
pieces everybody should take but

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
you know engineers can can who aren't

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,240
familiar with open source

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
can learn about kind of open source

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
development practices

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,560
in the in the consume or the or the

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
contribute

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,319
uh modules that we have but senior

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
executives can also

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
um learn both about kind of the strategy

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
and governance

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,919
but also how to work with with the their

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
engineering teams and how to work with

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,199
their legal teams

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
um in some ways i i wanted the benefit

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
of this to be for people

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
uh kind of across that engineering

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
management legal

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,479
uh spectrum for them to understand where

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,400
they all fit right

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,080
because we know it's not just it's not

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,639
just engineers it's not just

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
you know uh senior leaders it's legal

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
it's

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,120
you know qa and test it's release

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,720
engineers it's a whole wide spectrum of

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,599
people that you need to be all on the

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
same page

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,360
to work really effectively with open

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,759
source how were people you know who were

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,479
involved with open source program office

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,840
gained their skill up till now you know

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
since now you have a course where they

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
can

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,599
benefit from but how are they doing it

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,199
so far

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
through a variety of sources right i

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,680
mean uh you and i both know that that

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,680
that there's also the to do group right

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
which is a kind of a sub foundation area

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,399
of the linux foundation and i've been

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,080
involved in that community for

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
quite a while and contributed a lot of

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
things to it and i think

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
that's where people have tended to come

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
is through

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
through places like the to do group or

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,839
just finding that experience or

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
quite frankly um sort of muddling

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
through and i

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,080
i in my early career i muddled through a

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
lot of this right where where there

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
wasn't training and there wasn't we

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
we all were kind of learning on the fly

00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
and making making mistakes as you

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
pointed out and

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,360
you know having ip issues but um i think

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,640
my goal

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,839
really in in this training series is to

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,120
demystify a lot of that right and say

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
yes you're right you do have to be

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,920
careful but that shouldn't be a barrier

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,440
to actually trying because i think

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,880
we're finally at a point now with open

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,320
source program offices and in the

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,920
evolution of open source

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,760
use in industry where it's less about

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,120
the fear and certainty and doubt

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
right i mean our friends at microsoft

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
are fantastic now right and originally

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
they were the original purveyors of fear

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,000
uncertainty and doubt and now they're

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,560
doing

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,320
an amazing job in open source because

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
they've begun to realize

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,320
the benefit right and i think that

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,279
showing that benefit

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
and getting senior leaders to understand

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,800
and more senior leaders

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
understand the benefits of open source

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
and why you should do it and that you

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
shouldn't be afraid of it you should be

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
cautious

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,040
and you should have a good strategy but

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
you shouldn't be afraid of it that's

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,920
what i hope this

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,360
this the other thing that this uh course

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
series really uh

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
really helps put forward now before we

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
wrap this up what i want to know from

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
you

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,279
and these are your thoughts as as a

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,160
leader in open source yourself

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
is that as companies they do embark on

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
their

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,320
digital transformation a cloud native

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,920
journey and they will come across

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
open source they will come across only

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
open source that's what is there

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
why they should embrace uh uh

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,560
as they are consuming open source you

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
have touched upon but i want to wrap up

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
with these thoughts of yours that as

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
they do

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,480
embark why they should have a very

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,240
concrete open source strategy

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
and why they should also consider having

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,800
an open source program office

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,399
so that irrespective of how much they

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,839
want to give back or contribute

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
depending on how much resources they

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,640
have

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,399
but at least they should be able to

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,760
leverage these technologies in the best

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
possible way and not create a lot of

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,720
technical data as well

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,120
right well i mean i think we've all

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
heard the saying that open source is one

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
right yeah maybe not on the desktop but

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,200
as you pointed out

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,839
there's not a single thing from my watch

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
to

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
my phone to the computers we're talking

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
on now that

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,160
is not in some way touched by open

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,480
source right so

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,440
everybody's life is touched by open

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,959
source so

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
then you go up to where that where

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,000
organizations are and there's not a

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
single organization

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,040
and a lot of them by the way are not

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,959
traditional software organizations

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,079
right you look at somebody like a tesla

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
okay a car company

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
well they're a huge software

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,560
organization right so

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,720
having a consistent strategy

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,399
if you let me let me kind of put it in a

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
different way if you don't have that

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
strategy

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
what you're going to find especially on

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
the consume side which

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
you made a great point swap which is yes

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
it's really easy to download something

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,200
i would argue that it's almost too easy

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
in some cases because i've been in

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
organizations where

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
everybody just downloaded whatever

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,240
whatever right and it was like a

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
piecemeal and trying to get everybody on

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
the same page was really really

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
difficult

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,920
whereas saying hey we want to we want to

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,680
embrace open source we want to take

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
advantage of but let's have a consistent

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
strategy

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
for what we download right and it's not

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
just

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
technical fitness of purpose it's how is

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
the and this is where senior leadership

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,360
comes in and having a good strategy is

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,639
you know what's the community like right

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
am i downloading this thing that meets

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,839
my technical needs

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
but the community is dead and i've got a

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
project out there that essentially is

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,880
dead

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
and i'm now basing my business on it i

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,240
think having

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,680
your an open source program office at a

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,440
certain point when you

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,200
at in your organization and again it

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,120
depends on it it varies

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,399
in terms of when that that that break

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,440
point is when you need to create that

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,240
organization

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
um it gives you i think not just the

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
place to

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
to manage open source it gives you the

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,360
peace of mind knowing that

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
a key pieces key pieces of technology

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
that you rely on as a business that

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,040
you're building your value on top of

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,680
that those things are going to be

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,160
healthy right i mean the days are long

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,720
gone

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
of you know building a technology stack

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
soup to nuts

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,760
where you know you can you have complete

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,880
control of everything

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,639
the business reality now is that you

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,160
can't afford from an engineering and

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,040
business perspective to build everything

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,079
yourself

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,160
so with that knowledge you are relying

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,279
on a ton of things that are being built

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
by

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
partners potentially being built by your

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,000
competitors right and we haven't talked

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,839
about that but that's a really

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,040
good reason to have an open source

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,639
program offices because the

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
understanding is that a lot of your

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,760
competitors that are working in these

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
open source projects

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,639
that are benefiting you and them they're

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,240
there if you don't have a good strategy

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
from the beginning about how you engage

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,760
with that open source project

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,200
what's going to happen if your

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
competitors decide to take that open

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
source project in a different direction

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
that's counter to what you need

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
in your organization if you are not

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
contributing you don't have a seat at

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,120
the table you don't have a voice in how

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,480
those projects get managed

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,120
so really understanding that um

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,000
it's not just a luxury right i think

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,920
once your company

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,360
gets to a certain size and again it's

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,120
depends on where you are in the

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
evolution of your your journey in open

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
source but

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,040
without an open source program office

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,199
it's really difficult

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,959
to cohesively get a seat at the table

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,360
for these open source projects

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,399
and technologies that you rely on so

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
it's i think

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,800
um in some cases i would just view it as

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
table stakes at this point

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,399
for um effective you know use of

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
of open source technology and i think

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,519
the other thing i would

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
leave your viewers with is it's it's

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,639
long since past

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,320
just the use of open source technology i

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
mean the the number of people

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
that and organizations that i still run

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,360
into that that have this false sense of

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,279
security of oh we're only ever going to

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
consume open source

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,120
it just you know the the i've seen it

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
and it's not just me but we've all seen

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,519
it time and time and time again

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,120
that you know if you're sitting on the

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
sidelines just consuming

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,480
you're missing a whole bunch of

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
opportunity

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
to make your business uh more valuable

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
and to

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,399
and to safeguard sort of your business

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,639
and and your technology

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
against you know changes that may happen

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,560
without your ability to influence them

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,160

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
source world but also talking to me
