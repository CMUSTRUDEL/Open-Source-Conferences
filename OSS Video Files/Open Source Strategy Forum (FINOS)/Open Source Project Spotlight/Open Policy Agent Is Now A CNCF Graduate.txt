Title: Open Policy Agent Is Now A CNCF Graduate
Publication date: 2021-04-21
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	OPA, or Open Policy Agent, is one of the most popular open-source tools for administrators to have fine-grained control for their cloud-native environment.  The project was created by Styra and contributed to CNCF. The project recently graduated from CNCF to join matured projects like Kubernetes. Torin Sandall, VP of Open Source at Styra, sat down with Swapnil Bhartiya, CEO of TFiR and host of video interviews at Linux.com, to talk about the significance of graduation for a project like OPA which is already being used in production, the importance of OPA in the cloud-native world and what are some of the most exciting use-cases of the project.

hi this is your host

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
bharti on behalf of the linux foundation

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,719
cnc recently announced the graduation of

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,840
open policy agent or oppa

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,719
uh to tell more about what is oppa and

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
what does this

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,400
graduation mean today we have with us

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,199
once again taurean sandal

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
vp of open source at styra the creators

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,199
of oppa

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,880
uh turin it's great to see you again yes

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
yeah thanks for having me on i want to

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,640
first understand from you quickly

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
what is the importance of open policy

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
agent

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,360
what is the criticality of this project

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
for the entire

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,600
cloud native landscape sure yeah so we

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,399
we started the project at styra um

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,760
you know over five years ago now and um

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
you know we we created the project at

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,719
cyra because we

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
knew that you know these modern kind of

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,559
cloud or cloud-native environments

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
we're going to require a rethink when it

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
comes to things like policy

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,640
and authorization and so open policy

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
agent or oppa as we like to call it

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,680
um is essentially uh you know a building

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
block that

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
helps people towards that that direction

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
of kind of rethinking and empowering

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,879
themselves

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
when it comes to policy and

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
authorization in modern environments

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
so it provides a very fundamental

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
building block which is a way of

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,080
expressing policy

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,479
and having it enforced kind of

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,680
consistently across the stack

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,200
in their in their environments whether

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
you're talking about kubernetes

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
environments

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360
or microservice environments or cicd

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
pipelines or even applications

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
themselves

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
oprah basically provides a single

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,119
unified way of expressing and enforcing

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,040
policy

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
can you also talk a bit about how

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
different is

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,040
uh to deal with policies in the cloud

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
native words versus the traditional data

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
center space what we've basically seen

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,159
you know over the last you know 10 years

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
or so is a move to

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,600
much more dynamic and ephemeral and

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
heterogeneous environments

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
you know right so you know in the last

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,799
10 years or so we've seen an explosion

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,880
in terms of the number of different

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,360
technologies that any given organization

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,119
will

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,119
will be leveraging right you know every

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,240
single um you know developer is now

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
empowered to choose a different

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
programming language a different

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,399
database a different execution

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,680
environment a different protocol for

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
talking to their their name

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
their dependencies and so on right and

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
so there's just been this this

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
tremendous kind of cambrian explosion

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,160
of choice when it comes to the

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
technology stack that you're going to

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
use to build your applications right and

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
that that applies

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,599
in basically every part of the stack

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,959
whether you're talking about ci cd or

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
microservices or

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
even orchestration systems databases and

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
on and on it goes right

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
so there's just all these different ways

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
of running software today

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,440
of building software um and and the

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,959
challenge is that in the past

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
um you know each one of those those

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
pieces of software have its own

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
kind of project or product specific way

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
of expressing policy of

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
saying who can do what right and so

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
having you know 50 or 100 different ways

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
of managing policy and authorization

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
in a large organization is it creates a

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
tremendous challenge right it's

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,080
it's fragmentation that makes it very

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
difficult to

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
uh to under not only understand what

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,519
policies you actually have in place to

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
understand your security posture

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,360
but also to manage your security posture

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
because now if you want to um you know

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
put down end-to-end policies that

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,599
control who can do what across the stack

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
you have to go into each and every one

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
of those systems

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
and kind of configure them separately

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
and understand how to configure them

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
separately and that's a very difficult

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
task for

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
for for developers for administrators

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,800
for infosec and so on

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,080
at the same time you know we've also

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
seen a shift towards basically

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,720
distributed systems right distributed

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
systems have become

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,239
the norm right and so you know you can

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
no longer rely

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,879
on you know singular centralized um you

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
know services that run like in on a

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,400
specific server a specific data center

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
in order to control in order to manage

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
your

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,560
your applications right you need

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
something more um that kind of embraces

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
sort of the dynamic distributed nature

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,799
of modern

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,159
uh modern applications and so opal was

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
really designed for these more kind of

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
ephemeral dynamic

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,239
uh workloads and environments where you

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
might have applications that are being

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
deployed

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
and updated you know every you know

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
every hour or you know service

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
applications where they're being

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,280
updated every few minutes right and so

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,560
um there was this need also

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
for something that supported this kind

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,439
of ephemerality out of the box and

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,519
that's what oppa is really designed to

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
do it enables a distributed model for

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
policy enforcement and when we do talk

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
about distributor

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,080
how much uh does hybrid or multi-cloud

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,920
make it even more complicated because

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
you're running your stack on maybe

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,519
and today everybody wants to leverage

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,680
different clouds not only

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
uh there are so many different reasons

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,799
so how does that help them

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
maintain uh it across clouds

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,320
well i mean yeah i mean that's that's

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
part of um you know

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
open policy agent provides a way of

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
unifying policy

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
um across a bunch of different

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
environments right so whether you're

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,199
running workloads

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
inside of your own data centers or

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,080
you're running them

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
inside of you know amazon accounts or

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
gcp accounts or azure accounts

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
open provides you with a single way of

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
expressing policy across all of the

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
workloads in those different

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,040
environments right so this portability

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
story is a very important one and it's

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
actually one of the important reasons

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
why we ended up donating

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
to the cncf because we wanted opa to

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,600
have kind of a vendor neutral home

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
that it could kind of they could serve

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,560
as sort of a rallying point around

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
policy and authorization

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,240
and so you know by having oppa be part

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
of a you know a body like the linux

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
foundation like the cncf

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
um it really helps with this portability

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
story of giving people confidence that

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
they're going to have

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,960
a piece of technology that they can take

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,919
and they can apply um in all kinds of

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
different environments and different

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,160
cloud providers with different vendors

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
and so on

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,639
it has been graduated you know

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,240
at cncf i have a couple of questions

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,680
here number one is that if you do look

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
at projects like oppa

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
they're already in production companies

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,880
are already using it so what does this

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,880
graduation really mean

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400
in real world not only to the project

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,680
but also to the user because a lot of

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
users are already running it in

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
production

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,680
what does exactly what is the value of

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
uh graduation

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,160
yeah i mean i so like the cncf they they

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,520
outline a set of criteria

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,440
um that define um what stage a project

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,960
is at right so cncf has different stages

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,479
graduation being the final one being the

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,919
kind of the highest one

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,080
and and so it's really just it's really

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,280
a reflection of the maturity of the

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
project like you said you know there are

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
already

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
a number of like a large number of

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,759
companies that are running opa

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,600
at scale in production and that's what's

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
required in order to get to

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,319
to graduation right so in order to get

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,319
the project graduated we had to go

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
through a process of documenting

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
how it's used who's contributing to it

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
um that it meets certain technical uh

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
bars and so on right and so

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
the graduation status is really a

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,080
reflection of the the maturity

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
and the readiness of open policy agent

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
for for wide scale the kind of

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
deployment

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,960
and operational um use right um

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,080
so so from the project's perspective

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
it's really that kind of reflection of

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
maturity

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
i think more broadly for the for the

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,479
industry for the cloud native space it's

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,240
a reflection of the need for

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,880
um you know a solid foundation or a way

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
of doing

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,199
authorization and policy enforcement um

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,240
within kind of cloud native

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
environments right um the fact that all

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
these different companies

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
are running opa for a variety of

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,960
different use cases right

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,599
it's used within kubernetes it's used

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,639
within

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,160
um cicd systems it's used with cloud

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
provisioning it's used in microservice

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,160
environments for api authorization it's

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,400
even being used in the application now

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,759
i think that you know graduation is

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
really um

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,720
you know it's just it's just a further

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
reflection of of the fact that this is a

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,160
neat i think that's necessary right

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
it's a must-have for for modern

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
environments you have graduated what is

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,919
next for oppa

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,520
of course you have your own roadmap

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,080
which is open source anybody can go and

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,599
look at it

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
but from your perspective what are the

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
things that you are either

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
planning working on or some challenges

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,919
that you still have to resolve

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
or you know in general just summarize uh

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,560
what

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
things look like for oppa the project is

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,599
is kind of stable and

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,599
widely used so you know

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
one of the things that we're always

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240
looking at

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,360
improving is just kind of the onboarding

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
experience the getting started

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
experience for new users right we want

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
to make it as easy as possible for

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
people

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
to come on board and start leveraging

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
the project for some use case they have

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,919
in their organization and we've seen

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
lots of people be tremendously

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,120
successful doing that in the past we

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,400
want to make it even easier so we're

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
always kind of focused on that

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
that initial onboarding experience

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,199
obviously with lots of users running

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,120
opa at scale um you know we we run into

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
interesting uh performance and

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
and kind of scale challenges and we're

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,759
kind of committed to supporting those

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
users and making sure that they continue

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
to be successful

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
um as they continue to operationalize

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
opa and and really

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
um you know rely on it more and more in

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
the critical path of their of their of

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,400
their systems

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,919
um in addition to that you know one of

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
the things we did last year was we ran a

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,000
survey

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,360
and we asked people what are you what

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
are you using oppa or what are you most

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
interested in using

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,440
before and one of the responses that was

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
most interesting was

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,879
that um you know a large number is like

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,560
something like 50 of respondents out of

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
like the 150 organizations that

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,360
completed the survey said that they

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,120
they were already or they wanted to use

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,640
oprah around application authorization

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,399
right so offloading the actual like

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,320
application authorization decisions

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,399
um to to an engine like oppose is

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
tremendously um valuable and it's

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
something that a lot of folks are

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
interested in and so that's where we're

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
spending a lot of our time and energy

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
um in terms of feature enhancements and

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
optimizations and

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,120
and other work so that's something to

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
look out for in the next year is to sing

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
open leverage

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
higher and higher up in the stack as

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,560
you're talking about earlier about

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,959
graduation that it's already

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,200
in production can you give us some

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
example of some of the most exciting use

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
cases of oppa

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,640
sure yeah so the two kind of like broad

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,480
categories of use cases that we see

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,920
people adopting it for today

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,640
um are um authorization configuration

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
authorization

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,080
right so use cases like kubernetes

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,360
emission control right if you go to a

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,800
kubecon event

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
you'll see tons of people talking about

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
how they use opa to implement different

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
admission control policies using opa

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
right so these are

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,160
these are basically allowing you know

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,040
platform engineers kubernetes operators

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,040
administrators

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
to put down guardrails or safeguards in

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
their cluster to prevent

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
really bad things from happening right

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,240
to prevent um you know um

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
container images from you know like from

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
outside the corporate image

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
or registry from from running inside the

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,160
cluster uh to prevent

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
developers from like accidentally um you

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
know exposing

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,360
applications on the public internet or

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
allowing applications to talk out to the

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
public internet right

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,600
um you know a lot of a lot of

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
organizations are concerned about

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
uh you know data being exfiltrated right

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
and kubernetes

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
is great it's very powerful it kind of

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,079
hands over these tools to developers to

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
empower them and to allow them to kind

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,040
of self-serve

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
but at the same time that opens up a lot

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,079
of ways that people can can hurt

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
themselves because now they're in

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,120
complete control of the compute network

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
and storage resources that make up those

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
applications

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,120
you need some way to put kind of

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,399
safeguards in place and so we see a lot

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
of people leveraging oppa

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,680
for that kind of authorization use case

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
of putting safeguards and guardrails

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,480
over configuration whether it be

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,959
kubernetes configuration

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
or terraform configuration or cloud

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
formation configuration whatever it may

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,240
be that's one broad category

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
another broad category is around

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
microservice api authorization kind of

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
controlling

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,240
which services can talk to which and

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,120
which users which humans can talk to

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
which services

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,760
right so if you're in a large

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
organization you know you might be

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
running hundreds or thousands of

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,040
distinct micro services

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
um and and you might have all kinds of

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
different ways that people can interact

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
with them right you can have

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,560
services talking to other services you

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,959
can have employees talking to those

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,600
services you can have contractors

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,040
and you need some sane way of unifying

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,079
policy enforcement across all of that

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,519
because they're all implemented in

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,040
different languages they speak different

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
protocols there's different

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640
ways of identifying obviously humans

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,839
versus machines and you want a single

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,079
way really of

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839
of of capturing that um and and

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
enforcing it and so oprah provides that

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
and so we see that being heavily used

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,079
today now let's talk about uh the the

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
community

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
side of equation of course the project

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,959
originated from styra

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,440
a company then it became part of cncf

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,200
but if you look at this whole growth uh

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
can you talk about what role

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,880
uh does community play open source

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,079
community play in not only

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,240
improving their project but also kind of

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,279
uh advancing its user base we knew at

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,399
the very beginning that

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,680
um in order for this to be successful um

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
you know we'd have to rely heavily on

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,480
the community to help guide us

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,639
especially right and so

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
um you know we we quickly got something

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,279
working you know five years ago

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,040
and we got it out there and we got

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
people to look at it and try it and talk

00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,120
about

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
about their about their use cases and

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
kind of inform the project direction and

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
so

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,560
you know by engaging with the community

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
that really helped shape the language

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,560
and shape the use cases where we

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
where we applied it um and so over time

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
you know we were

seen contributions from the community

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
ramp up considerably

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
um you know the project while we started

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,680
it at styra it's now actively kind of

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,160
maintained and contributed to

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,120
by not only styra but also google

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,079
microsoft

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
vmware um and a host of other uh like

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
individual contributors essentially

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
right that

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,920
that that have you know very specialized

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,440
area of expertise especially when it

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,160
comes to things like integrations right

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
we knew that

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
in order for the project to be

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
successful um you know the core of it is

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,320
very

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
kind of general purpose and domain

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,959
agnostic

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,480
um but it needs integrations in order

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,760
for it to do anything useful and and

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
there's a tremendous amount of

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
knowledge and expertise that different

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
people bring when it comes to those

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,959
integrations and so that's been

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,399
absolutely key and that's come from the

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
community we couldn't have done that

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
you know on our own as a small group of

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,279
people we needed like the community to

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
help us build up these integrations and

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,279
you know you know get them production

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,639
ready and and you know document them and

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,079
talk about them to the world right you

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
know you need people to go out there and

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
talk about how they're using

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
the technology in order for other people

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,959
