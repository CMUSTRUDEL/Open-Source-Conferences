Description: 
	State of the Edge is a vendor-neutral platform for open research on edge computing that is dedicated to accelerating innovation by crowdsourcing a shared vocabulary for the edge. Hosted by the Linux Foundation, the project develops free, shareable research that is widely adopted and used to discuss compelling solutions offered by edge computing and the next-generation Internet. The project came out with the latest report recently and to deep dive into the report, we sat down with Jacob Smith, VP of Bare Metal Strategy & Marketing at Equinix, and Matt Trifiro, State of the Edge Co-Chair and CMO of VaporIO.
