Title: Open Hardware Is Becoming A Trend: State of the Edge Report
Publication date: 2021-06-21
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	State of the Edge is a vendor-neutral platform for open research on edge computing that is dedicated to accelerating innovation by crowdsourcing a shared vocabulary for the edge. Hosted by the Linux Foundation, the project develops free, shareable research that is widely adopted and used to discuss compelling solutions offered by edge computing and the next-generation Internet. The project came out with the latest report recently and to deep dive into the report, we sat down with Jacob Smith, VP of Bare Metal Strategy & Marketing at Equinix, and Matt Trifiro, State of the Edge Co-Chair and CMO of VaporIO.

state of edge is a vendor neutral

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
platform for

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,800
open research on edge computing as is

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,400
kind of dedicated to accelerating

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
innovation for the edge

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,519
there is now a new state of the edge

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,320
report

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,119
that looks at today's edge computing

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,960
ecosystem

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,240
and to discuss this report we have with

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
us two guests

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,080
matt trifero state of the edge co-chair

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,760
and cmo of

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,000
vaporio and jacob smith vp of bare metal

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
strategy and marketing at equinix

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
matt jacob it's great to have you on

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,880
this panel

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
great to be here it's great to be here

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
thanks for having us uh i kind of gave a

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,280
rough

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
idea of state-of-the-art but i would

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,680
love to hear from you folks

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,360
jacob you can start and tell me uh what

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
is it all about and then matt after that

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,480
i would love to have your views also

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
great yeah so the state of the edge

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,039
report has a long history almost four

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,239
years now

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
but it's all about bringing people

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,480
together around a shared um

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
a shared vision and a shared consensus

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
around the edge what does it mean what

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
are we talking about

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,879
what's going on and so we've produced an

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,239
annual report for the last few years but

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,840
this is the first one

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,760
under the auspices of the linux

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
foundation and the lfn project

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
so like you mentioned it's a vendor

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
neutral report we bring in a bunch of

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
different perspectives

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
and try to get our finger on the pulse

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,600
of where's the edge at today

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
and probably more important like where

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,880
is it going next matt how do you

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,360
look at state of the edge yeah so so i

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
came out

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,960
come at it from a slightly different uh

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,520
point of view um

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,159
you know i grew up in the formation of

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
of

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,799
cloud and and uh the sort of you know

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,240
transformation of the infrastructure and

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,960
one of the things that that

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
frustrated me as a marketer was how

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
these terms that are very

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
important for us to understand and

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
define and interact with

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,960
get co-opted by marketing people and i'm

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,720
a marketing person right

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
so we felt it was really important to

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
put a stake in the ground and really

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
define

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,360
what are we talking about what edge are

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,119
we talking about are there lots of edges

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,399
if so do they have different names and

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,240
that was just it was the start of a

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
journey and it became you know really

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
three projects it became the

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
the open glossary of edge computing

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,600
which is a uh

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,119
you know a dictionary of all the words

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
that's that's open source it's in a

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,239
github repo

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,480
it's the annual reports and it's also

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
the landscape which is the projects and

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
companies

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
um that that are in the edge computing

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
world um

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,440
and now we're part of the linux

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
foundation and all those

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
are hosted uh underneath that the

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,760
auspices of that governance structure

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
thanks for for explaining that jacob and

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
that now i

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
before we talk about the report i do

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
want to hear from you because when we do

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,599
look at edge people

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
would define it in whatever way they

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
want to define it you know those terms

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
you know when you talk about cloud

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
computing so i want to

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,160
know from you how would you define this

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
computing are we talking about iot

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,400
devices are we looking at tesla

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
as iot on wheels or are we talking about

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
edge data centers

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
so so let's talk about just demystified

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,120
the term itself

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,319
yeah so so they um there are there are

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
lots of edges there's lots of ways to

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
define edges um the linux foundation

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,519
and they have a white paper that's can

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,959
be downloaded for free at

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,319
um lfedge.org and it is uh

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,120
has a very good taxonomy of

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,800
the different edges you know the edge

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
that we're mostly interested in is the

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
edge of the last mile network

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
there's two sides to it there's a

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
service provider side

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,959
and then there's a user or device side

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
and both are really important

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,640
and with the with the financial model we

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,400
did take a different a

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,519
different approach than most uh the

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
models that are out there it's not a

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
total market sizing

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,799
it's a sizing of the data center

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
infrastructure

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,879
required to implement the applications

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
and use cases on both sides of the last

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
mile network and

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
i think that was just a bias that that

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
jacob and i brought to it because

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
you know we're data center people um but

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
it turns out to be a really interesting

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
number yeah yeah i'd add to that and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
that the there are lots of edges and

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
it's kind of evolving all the time but

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,959
the one that we've always described edge

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,439
computing at is where we're putting

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,480
computing closer to the data or to the

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,720
experiences

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,239
and so obviously there's a wide range of

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
what that means depending on your use

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,080
case whether it's like you said a

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,519
mobility or industrial iot or an oil rig

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
but but where we find is that the

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,120
shifting going on is around the edge of

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
the network where the internet is kind

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
of

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,000
in its next iteration or trying to get

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
there and pushing out further and closer

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
to where those experiences and the data

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,880
are being created and that's the edge

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
computing that most people are

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
curious about and you know that's you

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
know evolving pretty quickly i think

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,639
you'll see in the report

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,720
that it's going keep growing and

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,320
changing even more quickly

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
than it has in the past few years but we

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,880
noticed a lot of action

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
related to as you can imagine the last

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,000
year of being

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,360
you know pandemic pandemic pandemic size

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
is that a word

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
where everything kind of got changed and

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
turned on its head in some ways just

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
accelerated and

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
and edge computing is one of those

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,360
things that we all felt um

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,800
you know in our lives as we kind of

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,240
interacted over

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
zooms and went to school and did all

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,639
those things and that's kind of

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
accelerating the conversation

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,160
and i think helping people bring around

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,639
a more common understanding

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
right so what's the focus of this report

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,240
on this

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,080
specific use case and uh and what are

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
some of the key highlights

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,720
uh or you know something which you're

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,800
like hey this is something

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,960
exciting from this report great let me

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
kick us off we decided to structure this

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
report you know first of all we got

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
together as a committee

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
and you know kind of wrestled with well

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
what is this you know what what what's

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
important this year

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
right what's what's important what's

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
going on and what we ended up was

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,479
uh um four different main sections plus

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
a refresh of the model that we did last

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,680
year the financial model

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
um the four different sections that we

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,919
did were based upon hardware

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,360
software networks and critical

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,560
infrastructure sort of the main

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
components

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,320
of edge and edge computing so we asked

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,320
four different authors and

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,759
and and had them come in and help give

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
their perspective and research to each

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
of those sections

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,160
and that's kind of the main structure of

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
the report in terms of some of the

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,039
takeaways maybe matt you want to speak

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
to the highlights well i also want to

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,240
point out one of the things that we did

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,800
last year that we did

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
more deeply this year it was a feature

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
called

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
postcards from the edge so what we did

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
is we invited

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
uh contributions from leaders in the

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,639
edge community

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,479
um and offered to write a you know small

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,479
essay a point of view and we published

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,280
those as kind of interstitials

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,840
throughout the

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,840
the book so you could actually download

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
the white paper and just read

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,360
those points of views and come away with

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,240
a really interesting perspective

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,919
on edge computing yeah absolutely uh the

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
forecast models the other part swap deal

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,919
that i think

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,600
you know most people pay attention to

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
because there's a big number and i think

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
matt always says it right we know it's

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,840
wrong

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
you know it's just it's a forecast and

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
so understanding the future of

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,960
uh you know what's the size of the edge

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,880
computing markets you know we had an

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,199
interesting case study here because we

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
did a full bottoms up model last year

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
and then we had a year um to see well

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,960
you know what's right what's wrong about

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
that and kind of you know steer the ship

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
in a new direction

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
which ends up being a pretty big number

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,240
yeah 180 billion dollars of

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
data center infrastructure uh to support

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
edge computing and the big change from

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,160
last year to this year was just the

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,720
acceleration

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
of edge use cases driven mostly by covet

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
19.

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,280
um so that's that was really and the the

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
number

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,840
uh is again it's built up from the from

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
the ground up it's built up we look at

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
you know all the different use cases and

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
segments and the amount of compute that

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,440
be required for

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,199
for them and then it creates an

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
aggregate amount of

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,479
processing power in order to drive those

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,599
applications and then

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,479
converts that into you know basically

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,960
kilowatts

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,840
uh and then that that you can use sort

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,240
of standard

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,919
formulas for converting kilomon

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
kilowatts into

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
dollars of of infrastructure required to

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,039
house that that

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
compute yeah another big highlight was

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,599
around hardware right so that was an

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,160
area that i was

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,120
particularly interested in in 2020 we

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,240
had a lot of big

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,800
uh mergers and acquisitions uh announced

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
things like amd buying xilinx or you

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
know nvidia buying

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
uh trying to buy arm and you know

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
obviously there's kind of a

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
you know the end of moore's law going on

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,120
and the edges are really amazing place

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,319
to watch that innovation happening

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
so we saw a lot of um you know

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
interesting hardware being produced and

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,599
then being driven more and more by

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,759
the influence of open source software so

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,639
open hardware too is becoming a trend

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,560
and that whole uh kind of you know

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,400
physical component of how to

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,400
how to deploy at the edge is a really

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
big problem that that you can see being

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
attacked from a number of different

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,560
sides

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,159
uh because it's kind of the opposite of

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
what we've been doing in the cloud

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,440
you know for the last you know 10 years

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,120
putting a lot of things in a

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,640
in a few places now the edge kind of

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,640
pushes that model

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
to a new place which is how do you put a

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
lot of different things in a lot of

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
different places

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
especially when they're changing quickly

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
right well i'm also curious that what

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
rule

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,240
is because i think last year if i'm not

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,360
wrong the government you know

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,160
they released some spectrum for 5g uh

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
so what uh how is that helping uh the

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
industry because that also allows you to

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
build a lot of local networks

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,240
uh at the same time i think you

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
mentioned that

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
of course acceleration because of this

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
pandemic was there uh

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,160
and you know also focus on open hardware

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
open so technologies is there so can you

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
talk about some more factors that are

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,519
driving this adoption

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
or any other uh kind of specific

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
highlight that you saw

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,680
which kind of you know they are like

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,959
feeding into each other yeah

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,800
5g is a really good example because 5g

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,560
is not only an enabler for edge

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,279
computing it is also a consumer of edge

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,480
computing

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,959
one of the big transformations uh in

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
this this g from the last g is

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
virtualizing the network

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
functions which means that you can run

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,080
significant parts of the

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,519
telephone network the cellular network

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,279
on whitebox servers

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,040
sitting in a data center and those

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,480
servers can do other

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
can have other workloads running on them

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,839
those servers could be owned by somebody

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
else like a cloud provider

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
so there's a whole sort of interesting

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
set of dynamics that are created by just

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,200
rolling 5g out and then the the

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,360
capabilities of 5g

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
enable you know much faster

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
communication

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,320
connecting to much a larger number of

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
devices

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
out on the edge which again will help

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
fuel a lot of edge computing

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,959
applications

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,880
when we do a look at edge how much

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,640
concerns do you have

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,079
especially when we talk about networking

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,680
whether you talk about the first smile

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
or the last mile that people if they

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,800
don't have access to broadband

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,560
what's the point of having all these

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
technologies around us well to some

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
extent

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,160
you know that's what's what's the point

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,600
of having a smartphone if you don't have

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,320
access to spectrum uh

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
and there is you know a a a digital

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
divide

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,279
not just in the united states but

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
worldwide but one of the things that 5g

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,480
is driving and some of the other

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
innovations driving i mean you know

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,120
unlicensed spectrum is really

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
interesting because it's bringing a

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
whole new set of players in

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,160
there's a lot of open source now being

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
contributed to edge computing

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,200
a lot of i mean you look at the magma

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,000
project from facebook it's a

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
multi-tenant

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
evolved packet core that's open source

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
so i i think that a lot of the things

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
that are the audio innovations that are

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,760
that 5g

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,440
is driving will accelerate the rollout

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,880
of wireless broadband to

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
areas that currently don't have it

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
whether it's rural u.s or

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,000
you know some other country yeah and i

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,959
would i would add that open source is a

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
big driver of

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,079
you know creating solutions to hard

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,120
problems that are maybe

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,720
um niche you know some some some mass

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,640
market solutions going to cover

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
the the very profitable ones where

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,800
people have all the connectivity and all

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,560
the reasons

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
but we see edge computing going in lots

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,399
of different places um

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
matt mentioned you know new kinds of

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
unlicensed spectrum it's being deployed

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
in

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,360
disaster zones and in uh you know native

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
american indian reservations and

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
in rural communities where it's not

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
profitable to service in normal ways

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,160
also satellite new kinds of connectivity

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
so it's definitely

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,720
shifting but i'm always fascinated you

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,480
know by the the role of open source and

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
and kind of open governance

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
allowing those kind of innovations to

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,000
find their way into new use cases

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,519
and to fill in the cracks which we're

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
seeing you know low-power

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839
devices and open spectrum creating new

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,920
kinds of you know experiences that

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
previously you know you had to have

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,360
major equipment and

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
you know you know telecom deployments

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,800
for so certainly

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
you know the more open that we can make

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,720
certain parts of the

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,320
stack um the more likely we are to

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
bridge that digital defined yeah you

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,440
mentioned native

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
americans and i uh interviewed neuralnet

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
they are using uh

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
freedom fi and all those open source

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,160
technologies to to bring

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,040
connectivity there uh one thing more is

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,560
that you mentioned

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,079
and i sometimes feel that linux

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
foundation now happened to be at the

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,079
right place at the right time

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,720
so uh what role do you see lf edges

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,240
playing number one is by bringing all

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
these players who might

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
also happen to be competitors under the

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
same table to collaborate on these open

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
source technologies

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
number two is that since it's a big

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
umbrella foundation

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
there are a lot of other projects that

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,839
uh you

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
leverage kubernetes is a good example

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
you know uh i mean

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,720
there are linuxes there so it also make

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
it easy

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
for cross pollination between the

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,959
industries who would not interact

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,639
otherwise in the normal world so talk

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,360
about the role that lf and their

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,399
lf edge is playing in in kind of

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,279
furthering this

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,120
uh adoption of open source in this space

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
yeah so i mean open source in general

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,079
um you know everybody thinks they

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
understand it but do they really

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,160
understand

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,600
the business function of open source and

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,200
the reason that large companies are

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,399
contributing to open source now

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,839
is because there are base technologies

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,519
that if we decide not to compete on

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,200
but all contribute to something that's

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,880
in common and freely usable

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,560
then we can differentiate our business

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,959
and products on top of that you know

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
one of the great examples uh is like the

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,120
35 millimeter film right

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
that the camera companies you know

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,399
innovated on the cameras and the

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
shutters and the lenses

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
um and the film companies on the

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,000
emulsion process and the developing

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,079
process but nobody tried to compete on

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,839
the distance between the sprockets and i

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
think that this is just an example of

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,880
that but

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
much more complexity now the linux

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
foundation

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,959
one of the most powerful things it

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,600
brings to projects is a

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,079
really great governance model so it's

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
it's

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,199
very hands-off but it's also very

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
opinionated

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,320
and so projects that move into the linux

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,279
foundation have a

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
an openness to them that is is

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,639
irrefutable

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
it really is a powerful governance model

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
um and i think that

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,680
lf edge in particular does two things

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
one it helps to bring

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,040
a lot of these projects together and

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,079
create those those cross-pollinating

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,240
conversations um but it also almost from

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,399
a marketing standpoint it helps bring

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,760
these kinds of conversations to the top

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,040
of the stack because they're important

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
conversations to be having because

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,480
i mean this is the next generation of

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
the internet yeah i would agree i think

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,440
the edges and

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,880
is one of the great examples of you know

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
where you need an ecosystem

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
right it's complex it's specialized you

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,680
know where you differentiate like matt

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
said is

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,360
is important and so finding common

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
standards and you know

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
incubating technologies that are useful

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,000
to all is a way to accelerate and to

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,800
lower the cost

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
of differentiation so i think the

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,639
ecosystem

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
kind of culture that the you know linux

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,279
foundation and the broader open source

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,800
ecosystem

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,440
brings is is going to be especially

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
critical to how the edge evolves you

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,399
know and how open it is

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
and and you know that's really kind of

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,079
the the springboard for innovation

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,600
right and and can you also talk about

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,680
because if i'm not wrong state of edge

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,920
was kind of anchor project for lfa just

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,519
the way kubernetes was anchored for cncf

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
yeah so the evolution it's kind of a fun

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
story

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,399
how how stay the age so so when we wrote

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,519
the very first state of the edge

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,759
uh book the the first download um we had

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
six or seven writers all working on it

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,240
and we decided that we we should use the

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
terms exactly the same way every time we

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
use them and that's simple things like

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
you know should you capitalize it what

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,279
is you know what is is there near edge

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,399
and a far edge an iot edge and a telco

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
edge and all of that so we built the

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,199
style guide

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,639
just for the guide and i sent it around

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,399
to peers of mine

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,639
uh saying you know give us some feedback

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
and i i got overwhelmingly

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,079
oh can i use this oh here's the words

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,759
you forgot all of this so

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,279
so i called up the linux foundation i

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
said i have a crazy idea i don't think

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,600
it's ever been done before but

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,519
what if we put the glossary into

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
a github repo and we made it a project

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
so the very first

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,639
the entry point to the linux foundation

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,440
was the open glossary of edge computing

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,480
which is exactly that and then when the

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,040
the

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,240
the the lf edge formed

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,959
the open glossary was a starter project

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,839
um and that's when they said to our

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,360
organization

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,440
why don't you would you be willing to

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
bring the entirety of your intellectual

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,839
property

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,440
over to our community and we'll help it

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,480
grow and and steward it

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,480
so we did that so that became the the

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
open glossary project became a working

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
group

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,120
underneath the state of the edge and

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
that's when the state of the edge got

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,199
officially its landscape working group

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
and it's

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,040
it's uh research working group and matt

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
says organization for the state of the

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,160
edge in a very broad way we were really

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,480
a collection of like-minded

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,079
you know companies and um you know i

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
think we had great traction

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,399
uh but it was like like we talked

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,240
earlier about the governance of of

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,679
of the linux foundation and the culture

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,319
there uh

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
that really injected a sense of um you

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
know

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,400
maturity frankly to the state of the

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,039
edge report that we were sustaining

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,120
through

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,400
a lot of passion for the project and i

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,919
think great shared

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
values for it but it's easy to have

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,480
those things go away

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,520
you know all it takes is you know a

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,600
change in one of our

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,199
sort of you know corporate mindsets to

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,760
say no no this is gonna needs to talk

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,760
all about

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,600
my data centers not your data centers

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
and so getting it into the lf edge at

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,320
the ground

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
up i think is going to be you know not

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,280
only important to the lfh project to

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,559
kind of give it a

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,960
a sense of you know um you know

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,000
velocity around shared language like

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,760
matt mentioned

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,240
but also to kind of keep true to like

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
looking at the ecosystem in an open way

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,679
uh instead of a vendor-specific way

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,200
which i think that that's pretty

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
pretty new for the linux foundation i

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,280
mean i wish i wish every lf

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,919
umbrella group had a state of the you

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,559
know

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,960
state of the of the cncf state of the

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
the

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
kubernetes ecosystem or stuff like that

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
because i would go i would read those

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,600
every year

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,520
initially you also mentioned uh the

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,280
predictions that were made earlier so i

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
i want to you know put in this part that

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,799
so looking at this report

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,799
what kind of predictions you are going

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,480
to make and you will be brave enough

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,000
because i don't know if anybody said in

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
it back in that there will be pandemic

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,679
and the whole world will change

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,880
uh but i'm sure a lot of people who said

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,000
you know we will be doing a lot of

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
remote work if you're

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,200
moving the cloud see i told you so it

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,760
happened

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
so so let's talk about what prediction

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
do you have for

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,280
uh for the next year or the coming

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
months okay well predictions are always

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
hard i mean

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
you know would that we could go back and

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,720
say i told you so about you know all the

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
all the things that

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,000
have unfolded this year uh but i think

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,840
there's a few

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
a few things about edge computing that

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
you can kind of count on one is that

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
there's going to be

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,520
more stuff in more places than going to

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,679
be more different more specialized

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,440
partially like our model was built on

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,160
you know matt said like kilowatts and

00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
power

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
there's just not enough power in the

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
world to power all the experiences we

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
want we have to get more specialized and

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,960
more

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,600
um more efficient and so i would expect

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
to see a lot more specialized hardware

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
call it

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
the you know mega trend of mass

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
customization

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,520
uh you know that's gonna happen over the

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
next couple years for sure and the edge

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,039
is gonna be

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
a huge place where that happens the

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,240
other prediction i'll give you

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,400
and i stole this from a good friend of

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,679
mine who said if you're excited about 5g

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
wait for 6g

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,160
which the whole idea is like the use

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,880
cases for the infrastructure that we

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,120
build

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,480
are hard to know in advance but once

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,440
they once they hit

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,799
um then it kind of compels the maturity

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
of the technology

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,240
and then you move to the next thing

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,840
we're building for the future and so

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,360
you know there's going to be a next g

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,039
and there's going to be a next edge and

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,280
there's going to be a next whatever

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,160
but i think we'll we'll find that sort

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
of 5g

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,840
use case just like we found it with 4g

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,480
with the you know the

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
app store uh from apple on the iphone

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,640
kind of made

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,480
4g relevant and i think we'll find 5gs

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,080
like killer use case over the next year

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
too but then we'll be talking about 6g

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
well i'll make two predictions also so

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
the the first prediction i think we're

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,440
already seeing the signs of

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
and that is this this this incredible

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
acceleration

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
of the work that's happening at the edge

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,799
uh and i think it's driven largely by

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,880
the the awakening we all got with covet

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,120
19 because every company that had

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,280
you know a 10-year automation plan now

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,880
has a three to five year automation plan

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,480
and so my prediction is that the

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,760
companies that accelerate their

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,039
automation plans

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,880
uh will be the ones that are most

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,400
successful the other prediction i want

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
to make is and i'm going to say five

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,480
years

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,919
i think in five years we're no longer to

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
be talking about edge computing i mean

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,240
maybe in like

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,240
mining disconnected uh environments

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,360
um but but it's just gonna be the cloud

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,320
and the internet just a new one

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
or or the extension of the old one yep i

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
mean you know so when we

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
add fiber to our homes we didn't call it

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
something else

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,320
yeah but it was something else right so

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,159
i just think i think the edge computing

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
the reason we talk about it as a thing

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,280
today

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
is because we need a place to gather

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
where all this innovation is happening

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
in a way to talk about it but eventually

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,600
i just can be part of the cloud and the

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,200
internet matt jacob

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,880
thank you so much for a very interesting

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,480
discussion about uh

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,080
edge and also the story behind

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,080
the grocery and i'm pretty sure that

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
soon matt you will have a lot of job at

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,200
your hand

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
to for all the lynx foundation projects

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,480
now that i volunteered myself thank you

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
uh all jokes apart jacob matt thank you

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
for talking to me today and i look

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,039
forward to talk to you folks again thank

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,520
you

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:39,520
