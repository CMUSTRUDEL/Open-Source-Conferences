Description: 
	The Linux Foundation recently announced LF Research, which will try to understand different aspects of open source that go beyond code but play a critical role in the proliferation and sustainability of open source. In this episode, we sat down with Hilary Carter, VP of Research at the Linux Foundation to understand the goal and scope of the new division. When asked why the division came into existence at this time she said, “We needed to better understand the Open-Source paradigm and how it fits into the global software issues around supply chain security, and our ability to fight a pandemic. I think those were two factors that influenced the need to establish a Research Division.”
