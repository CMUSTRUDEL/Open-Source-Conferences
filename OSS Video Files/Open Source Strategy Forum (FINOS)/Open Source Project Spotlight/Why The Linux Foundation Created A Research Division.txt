Title: Why The Linux Foundation Created A Research Division
Publication date: 2021-06-21
Playlist: Open Source Project Spotlight
Description: 
	The Linux Foundation recently announced LF Research, which will try to understand different aspects of open source that go beyond code but play a critical role in the proliferation and sustainability of open source. In this episode, we sat down with Hilary Carter, VP of Research at the Linux Foundation to understand the goal and scope of the new division. When asked why the division came into existence at this time she said, “We needed to better understand the Open-Source paradigm and how it fits into the global software issues around supply chain security, and our ability to fight a pandemic. I think those were two factors that influenced the need to establish a Research Division.”

this is your host abner bharti and today

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,600
we have with us

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,639
hilary carter vp of research at the

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,400
linux foundation

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,559
hillary it's great to have you on the

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,320
show thanks swap it's great to be here

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,880
the linux foundation recently launched

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,600
research division to basically explore

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,119
uh open source ecosystem and impact uh

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
can you talk a bit about what is the

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
genesis what is the

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,080
the foundation of this initiative at the

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
linux foundation no pun intended

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,920
none taken at all it's uh you know we

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
find ourselves in an

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,360
an incredibly um exciting and

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
challenging time

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,399
and i think coming out of uh 2020

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,719
with the covet 19 pandemic i

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,800
i you know i think the world accelerated

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
to digital and the need to on-ramp very

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,239
very quickly to remote work

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,760
and zoom conferencing and hybrid

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,360
content delivery models and all of the

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
fast tracking

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
to digital just highlighted how

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,640
important software is to

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
our our functionality and and to

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
our ability to transact and to

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,880
communicate and to stay connected

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,479
and so that was very enlightening on the

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,560
one hand on the other hand we had

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,560
a pandemic that also drove home the need

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
to have functioning supply chains and

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,840
technologies around those

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,720
supply chains shareable data frameworks

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
consent frameworks around traceability

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,600
of of health records

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,960
um covent notifications and so on

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,400
and i think you know

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,600
we also need software that is secure

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,560
and having technologies that we trust

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
will help us fight a pandemic more

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,200
effectively

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
than than not and so given the year that

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
was

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,320
and on the heels of the solarwinds

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
security breach

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,079
um a lot of these pain points in our

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
software supply chains

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,240
and our our goods and services supply

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,960
chains were exposed

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,399
and so take those two factors into

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,200
consideration

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,200
and i think they were very

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
important in the context of setting up a

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
research division

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,520
that we needed to better understand

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,879
the open source paradigm and how it fits

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,239
into

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,840
uh the the global global software

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,000
um issues around supply chain security

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,640
and our ability to to fight a pandemic i

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
think that

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,280
is um those were two factors that that

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,040
influenced the need to establish a

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
research division when we do look at

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,440
open source

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
i mean since it's so pervasive everybody

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,959
is using open source so when we do talk

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
about research into ecosystem

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920
there can be so many things you can talk

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
about we can talk about hey okay

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,480
companies are using open source but

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,000
are they using some best practices do

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
they i mean you linux foundation also

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
have the open source program office

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
training you know

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
are they properly dealing with open

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
source it can also be about hey

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,040
are they using the proper license it

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
could also be about

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,879
uh what kind of practices they have and

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
of course it could also be about

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,599
understanding hey

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,000
how companies are consuming open source

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,560
so this this is such a huge massive

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
field

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,599
so i'm just trying to understand that

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
what exactly

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,360
are you trying to achieve with this

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,080
division yeah beyond

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,799
the security project for example we have

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,720
so much content that we can investigate

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
and in fact the challenge will be to

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
define the initial scope of the research

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
because as you say there's so many

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
incredible topics that we can

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,519
investigate

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
what is the path to open source

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,159
ecosystems how does an organization

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,599
move from a closed innovation model to

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
an open innovation model

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,879
what are the opportunities what are the

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
challenges what is the role of the open

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
source

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,239
program office um how does open source

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
collaboration

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,920
uh change business models and what

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
open source ecosystems are more

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,439
effective

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
than others in both addressing some of

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,200
the world's most critical challenges

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,439
but also in applying some best practices

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
whose practices are working really well

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,079
whose communities are inclusive

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,519
whose communities are growing so by no

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
means are we limiting the research

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
program

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,720
to security i simply mean to say that

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,639
it's one of the most important

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
challenging challenges that research

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,520
must address

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,600
but the opportunities to cast the net

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,400
really wide and to go deep into the

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
subject matter

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,560
are quite phenomenal what is going to be

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,639
the nature of this initiative is it a

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
foundation with the linux foundation it

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
is just a different because then we look

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
at the

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
format of linux foundation there are

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
foundations within linux foundation

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
so is this going to be yet another

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,400
foundation or is just one subsection of

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,639
the broader linux foundation

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,880
yeah we're not ourselves a unique

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,759
foundation we are a support

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
project so we are supporting the broader

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
work of

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,880
of linux foundation as a whole uh

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,039
research will be available to

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,000
both linux foundation members but also

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,919
the general public

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
but yeah we're not going to register

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,680
ourselves as a separate entity we are a

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,240
supporting unit of the parent

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
linux foundation has a massive family of

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,520
companies

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
other projects that so how are you plan

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,199
to collaborate with them or you're going

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
to work like independently

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,280
and collect all the data and analysis or

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,160
you are going to engage with the linux

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
foundation members

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,520
yeah wonderful question the objective of

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,400
linux foundation research

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,000
is to engage our ecosystem to engage our

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
members to engage our contributor

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
communities

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,720
so that we can create a program that

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
adds value

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,800
across the organization across the whole

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
ecosystem

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
we want to be able to determine

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,919
collectively

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,919
how can linux foundation research

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,759
add value to the ecosystem and how can

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
the ecosystem add value to linux

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
foundation research

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,039
and so by working together with the

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,560
specific project

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,919
um leadership teams and to co-create

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
research

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
that is certainly going to form part of

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,280
our program

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
we will have our own core research

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
initiatives

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,039
like our security project but we will

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,160
also work on a number of

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,600
project specific research reports

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,120
and that that engage the broad ecosystem

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
you did a little to that earlier but i

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
just want to go a bit deeper into

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
what are your immediate projects that

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,960
you will

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
start with so the first project we

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,880
actually have a survey in the field

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
right now it is a collaboration with the

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,120
soda foundation

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,759
it's a software it is excuse me storage

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
and

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,919
data focused open source ecosystem

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
and they want to explore trends in data

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
and storage

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,000
and produce their findings

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
our findings in time for the soda con

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
conference which takes place in july so

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,680
that's an example of one of the first

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,360
collaborations that we will do with one

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,840
of our projects

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,720
similarly we'll be working with

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
hyperledger um

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
hyperledgers are our blockchain uh focus

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,759
project

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,919
and hyperledger turned five um

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,319
in december of last year and that

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,120
ecosystem has grown tremendously

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,639
uh they're conducting a brand study with

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,520
lf research

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,479
to better understand how well is

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,000
hyperledger

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,960
known as a leading blockchain

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,120
open source community how well are the

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,720
projects known there are

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,919
a number of different frameworks a

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
number of different tools that are

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,759
available

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
are they recognizable are they confused

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
perhaps with some

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
crypto protocols what are the

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
opportunities and challenges

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
so that's another project that is going

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,639
to

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,199
come forward this year and similarly

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,680
with

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:11,199
um phenos our fintech and open source

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,919
uh project uh they are focusing on

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,680
understanding opportunities for the

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,720
financial services sector

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,400
and open source that is an incredibly uh

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,400
burgeoning community and there are a lot

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,639
of exciting opportunities that are just

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
getting started within that industry

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,599
so those are three examples of project

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
specific collaborations that will be

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,479
moving forward this year

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,880
we will be exploring open source

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
paradigm the open source paradigm from

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,279
the context of

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
industry analyses technology uh

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,920
horizontals

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,080
and the ecosystem at large there has

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,519
been a cambrian explosion

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,519
in terms of new projects that are coming

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,120
under the linux foundation umbrella uh

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,240
two examples being

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,880
the academy software foundation the fact

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,320
that the film industry is working

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,480
with the linux foundation to create

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,839
shared technologies for the

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
entertainment industry is really

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,200
something that

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,399
that most people would not equate with

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
when you think of linux you don't

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,839
necessarily think of the film industry

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,279
um same thing for some of our climate

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,120
uh initiatives or uh projects that

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,839
are are um dedicated to

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,640
solving issues around racial injustice

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,480
and what are the

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,680
what are the tools that we can create

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,160
together

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,320
for shared value to try to solve some of

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
these really important social challenges

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
not just technology challenges hillary

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,360
thank you so much for taking time out

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,360
today and talk about

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
this new initiative within the linux

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,399
foundation i i fully agree with you that

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,839
as much open source as we are creating

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
linux foundation is playing a critical

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,120
role there

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,000
we do need to tap into collect some data

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
that you know

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
uh yeah it's about time that we should

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
understand and help ecosystem

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,920
with all the problem that you mentioned

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,040
there so thanks for talking to me today

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,880
and i look forward to talking to you
