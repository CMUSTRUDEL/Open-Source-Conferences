Description: 
	KubeEdge is an open source project that originated at Huawei and contributed to CNCF. The project is created for extending containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at the edge. It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides infrastructure support for network, application deployment, and metadata synchronization between the cloud and the edge. We sat down with Zefeng Wang (Kevin), Lead of Cloud Native Open Source Team at Huawei, to learn more about the project.

hi this is your host supreme bhartiya

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,360
and we have with us today zephang wong

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,000
lead of clouded your open source team at

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
huawei

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,120
tell me about cubish what is the project

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
all about

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
so cuba to this project is built on

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,920
kubernetes

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,720
trying to extend the uh capability of

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,160
cloud native

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,080
uh software to the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,880
age so make it the user to achieve same

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,399
experience

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,920
managing the uh applications and the

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,879
resources across cloud and age

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
now tell me how are you involved with

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,200
the project

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,879
and when did the project start

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,000
so this project is started in

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,719
2018 and i'm one of the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,760
co-founder of this project and currently

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
i'm

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
working on the development and also the

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,960
uh

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,199
the community governance yeah so you are

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
at

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,000
hawaii but are you also involved with

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,439
cncf uh yes i'm currently a

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,960
uh sensitive uh toc contributor

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,840
and i'm also working on another cncf

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
project

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
that's called a volcano can you explain

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,280
that

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,439
what problem that you saw in the space

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
and at the way that you created this

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,920
project

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,640
so we know that kubernetes

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,880
was actually designed for the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
environment in data center

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,439
while when we tried to build

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,960
applications running on the

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,560
age the network it may be limited

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,520
because especially when it's

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
coordinating with the cloud because the

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
middle is

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,280
the uh the internet the network

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,320
may not be stable and it also

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,360
the age devices may be located in the

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,479
private network or behind the firewall

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,080
and also the age resources

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,239
are very limited so we uh build these

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
this project trying to resolve these

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,800
problems now let's talk about

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
the state of the project can you talk

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
about

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,720
at what stage is the project is it uh

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
incubated project at cncf and what

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
release is there

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
what are the features that are there at

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
this time

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
we released every three months so we're

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
basically following the uh

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,599
versioning semantic and we

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
also already got some production grid

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
and user

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
using this project in their environment

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,160
now let's talk about

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,319
we talked about the project we talked

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,760
about the code let's talk about people

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,319
can you tell me what kind of diversity

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,319
