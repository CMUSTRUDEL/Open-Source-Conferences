hi

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,879
this is your host open party on behalf

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,759
of the linux foundation and today we

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,400
have with us

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,120
david mark clement principal engineer at

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,280
cto.ai today we are going to talk about

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
this introduction to node.js training

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,359
that is started by a linux foundation

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
uh before we go there i want to just

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,840
quickly learn a bit about you

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
i've been working with node uh since

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,880
about

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:33,040
2011. um i got into it because

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,960
i wanted to uh find something that was

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,399
uh good for the for building sort of

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
real-time stuff back then

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,280
i came across it there wasn't a lot of

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,960
documentation there wasn't a lot of

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
books and i ended up

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
putting in a book proposal and writing a

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
book called node cookbook

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,239
which uh is now in its fourth edition i

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
wrote the first three

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,440
uh and the third one with some some

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
guest authors but uh

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,480
another person has written the fourth

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,719
edition um

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
but yeah so i started off by by just

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
sort of really

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
deep diving into node and the node

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
ecosystem at the time

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,840
i went from doing that to uh doing

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
contracting and consultancy

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,240
um ended up with a company called near

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,000
form where we did a lot of

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
different projects and consulting and

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
different things like that

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,119
um and then uh as part of

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
uh the the conference speaking and the

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
different things that that ended up

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,360
getting involved in

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,560
in creating the certifications uh that

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,080
would probably talk about

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
and also this sort of this training that

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,600
we'll probably talk about as well if you

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
look at uh

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,159
node.js i think it has been around for

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,280
almost

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,320
12 years now and it continues to remain

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
one of the most popular um most used one

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
of the most used technologies

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
so i want to understand from your

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,960
perspective is that

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,520
what contributed to to its uh

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
significance importance even in today's

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
modern itn cloud native world there's a

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,479
lot going on there i think one of the

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,719
the key things is uh javascript

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,560
javascript is the the lingua franca

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,960
uh of programming languages just because

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,240
of its uh presence in the browser

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,479
um pretty much uh anyone who's who's

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,720
programmed uh

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
that deals with anything that ends up

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
going to the web

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,280
has at least you know done a view source

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,560
and looked at

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,720
and looked at that so that's

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,480
that sort of that familiarity i think

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
was was responsible for some of the

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
early success

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
i think that javascript is a language as

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,879
an event-driven

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
language is both compatible with user

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,519
interactions

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,879
like in the browser and it's compatible

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,920
with network interactions

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,440
like with node so using javascript as a

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,080
mediator language

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
uh it has i think been key to a lot of

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,560
its success

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
um because it's because of both node and

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,519
then

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
uh uh the browser and the browser before

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
it i think

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,400
at some point a network effect started

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,239
to kicking as well

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
in terms of how many people use

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,760
javascript and that made it

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
sort of a commodity language which means

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,120
that it's easier to hire for so if

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,400
you build things in javascript you as

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,760
a company then uh you you can

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,959
have access to a a market that has

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,760
uh sort of a wide selection of

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,080
of of engineers that may know javascript

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,200
and

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,360
something else as well so

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
i think that's that's a big part of it i

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
think the other thing was

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,159
in the original days of node uh having a

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
small core

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,640
and keeping it quite small for a while

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
led to a lot of innovation

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,879
uh into building different types of

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,920
things with it so you can build clies

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,959
with it you can do

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,040
do iot with it as well as your

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,879
websites and different things like that

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,000
so the fact that it's more of a platform

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,959
just just has allowed uh that dynamic to

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
to grow and

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,599
for different people different things

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
with it and then there's npm of course

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
which is

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
uh the the package manager and registry

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
um

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,159
for node um and the front end space

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,159
coming in

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,439
and using npm for packages in the

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,080
front-end space

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,360
created another dynamic where you have

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,360
this crossover

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,400
between front-end and back-end and again

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,080
that's another

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,160
hiring plus you can hire people that

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
work with javascript on the front end

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
that could also potentially do back-end

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
stuff um

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,759
so i think that's a lot of what has

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
driven the the success of the language

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
one other thing about javascript as a

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,320
language is the is the

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
the the nature of the language itself it

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,360
was it was written very quickly

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,040
in a in a sort of uh a sort of chaotic

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
tomorrow's time the browser was in the

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,520
90s

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,479
um and i think in a way the language

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,560
itself

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,440
um sort of it is a little bit chaotic

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
and that sort of represents reality a

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,199
little bit more

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,400
in my view than languages that are much

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
stricter

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,680
um you you by by by having

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
sort of a messiness that's inherent in

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
the language it kind of

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
in my mind helps me to think about how

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,680
to how to

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
code in a way that represents the real

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
world as much as possible when we look

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,840
at linux foundation

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
you know they keep coming up with

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,360
reports that there is a huge

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
gap in supply and demand of a lot of you

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,080
know uh talent pool

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,039
so what is the situation with node.js

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,160
how does this demand supply of talented

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
people look like there

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,960
what are the pin points yeah i think

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
there's i think there's a supply and

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,680
demand problem

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,240
in tech generally right um

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
but obviously the the java landscape of

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
of from

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
coming from the 90s and forwards there

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
was so many people that trained in that

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,199
at university and different things

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
because that that just was the default

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
language and it was kind of it was the

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
language of business and things like

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
the the sort of evolution towards using

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
javascript because of the things we

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
discussed about it being the lingua

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,280
franca and different things like that

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,479
um has led to a you know a need for

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,919
for people who do that um like

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,680
to today really um it's a

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,360
a lot a lot of hiring has been done just

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
based on experience there hasn't been

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
any certification

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,479
or or official certification by a

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
foundation i mean or or

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
training there's been training but not

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,039
that leads to

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,840
certification so um the

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
i the the supply and demand problem i

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,720
think to a certain extent as well

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,960
is um

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
establishing what someone's skill level

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,840
is in the language

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,479
um and and hiring on a sort of a

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,720
standardized

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,479
scale for for that skill level

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
and that's that's very difficult to

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,240
quantify in any programming language

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,080
and it seems extremely difficult to

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,319
quantify in javascript because

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
of this because of the fact there's so

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
many use cases

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
for it an app and ways to use it and

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
it's also a very

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,280
um flexible language it can be used in

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,800
different ways in and of itself

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,840
so when it comes to uh to all of that

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,880
one of the things that i've worked on to

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
try to help with um

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,160
selection uh and employment and

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
different things like that

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,639
is figuring out a way to create this

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,919
sort of a standard level

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,520
where on on a pragmatic uh level

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,440
you can uh determine whether someone has

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
the the skills needed for this

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
particular job and that's

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
that's one of the main reasons i got

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
involved in working on the

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
certifications

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,639
right so let's just uh go a bit deeper

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,800
into the

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,919
the linux foundations you know online

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,319
course which is a

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,000
free course for node i want to just can

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,599
you just tell a bit more about

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
what is all about um who is it targeted

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,360
at

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,720
there's a free course on on edx um

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,520
there's also um uh

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
there's also two other courses uh for

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
certifications and these are all

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
provided by the linux foundation the

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
free course is a sort of a

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
slightly deep dive kind of ramp up throw

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,560
you in the deep end

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
and and build some stuff uh we build a

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,400
cli tool

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,879
we build some mock services and we build

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,720
some real-time services as well

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,879
and and then put them all together in in

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
this course and it's it's really just

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,000
to give people um a way to sort of uh

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
not just dip their toe in the water but

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
kind of uh

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,919
immerse themselves in in the in in

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,599
building something with node.js and

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,680
seeing how that feels

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
um and it's it's it's there to help

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,839
people acclimatize to

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,640
um uh the versatility of working with

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
node

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
um and to potentially then take next

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,920
steps from there

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,519
uh to to work

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,800
to work on other things with no do you

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,640
go in different directions from that

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,040
from that free course you did

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
talk about there are multiple courses uh

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
can you just

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,760
give a quick kind of overview or summary

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,279
of the free course so the free course is

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,399
um six chapters um

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,399
and it talks about um uh

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,839
it starts with a front end uh that's

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
just given to you

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,600
and then it helps you build uh a back

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,600
end to it

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
um but where you're you're mocking uh

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,560
some of the back end pieces

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,320
and it's a focus on when you're working

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
in an environment

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
an enterprise environment or startup

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,880
environment it doesn't matter

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,640
you don't always have access to services

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
in local development they might not

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
exist yet or there might

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
be problems with just getting the the

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,200
operational parity right

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,000
in your local environment so

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
um the first chapter talks about how to

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,640
uh

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,000
how to build out these these mock

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,800
services that you can use to

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
integrate a front end with uh so that

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,360
you can get a happy path

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,760
a happy path kind of flow uh um

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,920
of of say data between a front end and a

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,560
service or a service and another service

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,680
um then it goes on to to building a cli

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,640
tool

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
um that integrates uh with the with that

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
service as well

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
and then we go on to building uh

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,120
real-time services to show

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,560
some of the uh um versatility that

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,360
node has in dealing with uh

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,680
um just like the real-time mediation

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
it's

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
it's can be really good for that as well

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,560
as the other things

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
so once somebody has completed this

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
course i have two four questions for

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,640
number

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
one is that what is the next step for

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
them like you have prepped them about

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
the technologies what is the next that

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
they

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,480
should do number two is that once they

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,079
have taken the course what are the

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
things that they are capable of doing

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,440
so in in the last uh section of

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
the free course we we do talk about what

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,920
the next step should be

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,120
i think the the the main one is uh to

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
move towards

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,360
um getting certified because um

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,279
uh if you go through the the

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,480
certification training

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,360
there's an amount of rigor that's

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,959
applied that um

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,279
puts you on a level that

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,800
that we can establish that from a

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
practical point of view

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
that you can actually build things with

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,800
node there's two certifications one's

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,680
the

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,200
javascript uh sorry the one's the node

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
application developer

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,920
certification and the other is the node

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,519
services uh developer certification

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,279
so in the free course we actually build

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,399
some mock services

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,320
but the uh services um

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
uh developer certification and the

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
training is a focus on

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,040
on building real world services and of

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,320
and also covers uh security this is a

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,519
really common use case

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,800
in in building uh things with node

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,880
uh for for enterprise and startups um

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,480
just building json restful services so

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,760
we have a whole certification dedicated

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
to that because it is quite a common

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
case

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,200
then we have the node application

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,480
developer

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,519
uh certification um that

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,920
that covers the a broad surface area

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,800
of use cases with node so the focus

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,800
isn't on

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,519
uh on trivial uh like minutiae like

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
do you do you understand like uh the

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,760
details of certain

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
core apis or library apis the focus is

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,720
on

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,959
um here's a practical problem can you

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
provide a practical solution with node

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,079
either using the core apis or using

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,839
libraries

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,399
or using a framework so um

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
if you go from the free course into into

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,040
this mode

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,160
both of those courses prepare you for um

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,800
for workplace uh um

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
activities um for doing things that are

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
actually practical

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
with node um and then if you can go

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
through that and you can get the

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,880
certification

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,600
then you can show to an employer that

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,600
i've met a minimum standard

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,279
for working with node which um the

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,760
certifications are

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
upper intermediate level um they're not

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
they're not easy

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
but they're they're um that's that's the

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,560
whole point

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,560
is to make them hard enough that the

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,000
rigor is applied to show that

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,839
um that you have what it takes to to

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,760
to uh be paid to to work with node

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
awesome before we wrap this up last

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,480
question that i have for you

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,160
is that why should greenhorn or new

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
developers they should look at

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
node.js as a technology or language or a

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,560
whole platform

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,320
to build their career on so why why

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,399
should new developers

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,720
get into node.js i think that's a really

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,680
interesting question because

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,600
um the first thing way to answer that is

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,199
to to think about where is node

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,639
going like is node going to last

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,519
um because you know if you if you invest

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,920
so much time in

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,040
in specializing in node you're going to

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,880
want it to last

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
you know for maybe maybe at least 10

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,839
years um

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,600
so does node have 10 years uh left

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,720
definitely easily so much stuff has been

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
built

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
on node that in in terms of maintenance

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,079
alone

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
like we're not saying goodbye to it

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,600
anytime soon

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,440
um there are newer languages out there

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
that rust is a very compelling language

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
and different things like that

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
so it to a certain extent it depends

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,320
what you want to do

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,800
um with with node your positioning is

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,120
the

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,839
the front end of the back end so you're

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,600
not necessarily building

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,199
uh highly integrated pieces

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
you're building pieces that integrate

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
with other parts of the stack most of

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,720
the time

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,920
so if you have a leaning towards the

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
front end as well

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,160
then it can be a good space but equally

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,279
i know people that have come from doing

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
architecture and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,720
and back-end pieces and move into

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
working with node it's kind of a middle

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,600
ground but

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,199
um if you're getting into the industry

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,920
um javascript is in high demand

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,519
um learning node means you learn

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
javascript and if you know javascript

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
then you

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,880
can do browser stuff as well um so

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,160
you've got this nice cross section of

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,240
things that you can work with

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,399
and uh yeah it's

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,040
there is no right answer to like what

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,760
language someone should get involved in

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,720
um but i think that node is a good

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,240
answer

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,880
for what you can get involved in i think

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
that there's so much going on with it

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,720
and there's so much that's already been

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,480
built with it that um

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
it's a no-brainer in terms of

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,000
hireability david thank you so much for

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,079
uh joining

me today and talk about not only the

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
important significance of nodules but

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
also the resources that linux foundation

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
is creating

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,720
for for for those who are you know

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
interested in the technology

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,880
