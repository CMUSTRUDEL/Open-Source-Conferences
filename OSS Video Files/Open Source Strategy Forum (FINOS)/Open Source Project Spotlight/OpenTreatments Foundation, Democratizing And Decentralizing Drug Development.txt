hi this is your host supreme bhartiya on

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,359
behalf of the linux foundation and today

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,639
we have with us

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,360
sanat kumar mesh founder and ceo of open

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
treatments

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,799
foundation sanat there is a very

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
heartfelt emotional

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,080
and very personal story behind the

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,080
project behind the foundation

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,240
can you just tell me the story because

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,039
there's a lot of personal uh

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
things there yeah absolutely um thanks

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,840
for having me on the show it's

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,320
it's an honor for me um my personal

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
story

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,680
starts um from 2018 uh when my son

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
raga was born he is about two years old

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
now

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,360
uh but he when he was born um he had

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,440
significant challenges in his ability to

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,160
move his hands he could not move his

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,840
hands he could not move his legs

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
he didn't eat anything by mouth when he

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,239
was born

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,600
and in just few hours after he was born

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
the doctors noticed that there was

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
something

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,840
abnormal with him we didn't know what

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,560
was going on at that point

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
and so we spent over 21 days in the

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
hospital

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,680
trying to find a diagnosis for his

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,880
problem

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
but we found nothing we came back home

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,479
with the with the hopes and the promises

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
from the doctors that

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,720
um you know he will continue to develop

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
that this is probably just a delay in

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,040
development

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
um but it wasn't until his first

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
birthday

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
that we we noticed what his real problem

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
was

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,079
um and that that is when we got uh the

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,880
diagnosis that he has

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,320
an ultra ultra rare genetic condition

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,799
how old is rakha now

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,759
he's two and a half okay so uh so not

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,600
only he

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,000
bravely survived he's still fighting so

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,360
uh you know the condition you know it's

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
ultra rare so

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,479
doctors medical science doesn't know

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
much about it

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
but you are doing something about it

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,119
what are you doing after we got his

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,159
diagnosis

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,719
i went back home and i started googling

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
to really understand um is this really

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,360
rare

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,280
how can it be rare right it gives so

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,959
many scientific advancements

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
we have crispr we're talking about going

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,680
to the mars sometime soon

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,599
we're talking about lunar tourists and

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
how can it be so rare

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
it turns out there was just nothing

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
nothing on google

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
about this disease or this biology or

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,480
this gene

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,920
so i put together a team of scientists

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,480
um that

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,959
agreed to help me out i wrote a blog

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
post

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
sharing my story and shared it with my

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,360
friends and family

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,440
the blog post went viral and we ended up

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
raising over a hundred thousand dollars

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,519
in less than two days

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,120
and this is the point where i realized

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
over 2 000 people

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
and these are folks that i i don't even

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
know over 2 000 people came together and

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,760
donated and wanted

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,040
wanted raga to succeed want to drag up

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
to walk in the park

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,720
go to school and go to college just like

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
you and i would do

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
and this changed my perception on what i

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
should be doing this gave me the hope

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,200
so i started leading through the

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,440
scientific literature

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,720
to see what drugs i could i could use on

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,040
raga right away

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,680
and we identified 36 drugs that we could

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,360
repurpose for his condition

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
and after um um getting one of the drugs

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
started on raghav

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,959
we noticed a significant improvement in

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,720
um in his energy levels

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,959
to a point where he was able to lift his

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,000
head up for the very first time that he

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
has never done in 15 months of his life

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,239
so i knew that i was on to something

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,280
here um i created a cocktail of four

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,680
different drugs

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
got raga started on the cocktail and in

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,879
about

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
nine months we noticed a reversal in

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,879
some of his skeletal abnormalities

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,959
and so through my experience of

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
helping find a treatment for raghav and

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
we are not done yet we are still on the

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
mission there are still a lot of

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,319
challenges for him

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,360
but through my experience i realized

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,360
that this whole process sucks

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
patients and patient families like us

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,519
have to go through this journey

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,280
again and again and again having known

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
nothing about the biology i don't even

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
know what genes were before

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
before before all of this diagnosis um

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,519
and we are having to sort of

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
reinvent the wheel and boil the ocean to

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,199
help find the treatment for our loved

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,479
ones just because no one else does

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,400
and so i'm i decided to start a

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,759
i decided to challenge the status quo

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,440
using a software platform

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,960
which is what i am best equipped to do

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
because of my background as a software

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,199
engineer and so i'm starting a new

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
initiative called open treatments

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,160
foundation

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
to decentralize drug development and

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,080
give the power

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,120
of software platform to allow every drug

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,199
developer

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
um every every person in the world to

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
help build a treatment

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
and this person could be you know a

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,199
patient like me

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
this could be a a family member this

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,600
could be a scientific

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
expert expert who knows a lot about the

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
biology

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
but does not know a lot about the drug

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
development process and this software

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
platform will empower them to help

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
help build treatments for them so your

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,919
background is

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,880
in software and but you are creating a

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,080
foundation which calls

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,440
open treatment which is if i'm not wrong

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,320
more about uh medical science so this

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
is not as easy as writing a serverless

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
you know

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
application or creating a cellular

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
technology is much more challenging so

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
talk about some of the challenges

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
that you see when you created the

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
foundation

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,600
uh that you are also not only aware of

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
but you're willing to tackle at the same

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
time

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
you can not take on everything so you

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
are like hey

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
this is only that i am willing to do as

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,080
part of this foundation tell me

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
the scope of this foundation from uh

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,639
this premise

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,840
this is what we think about healthcare

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
right you go to a doctor you get a

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
prescription

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,160
you find back you come back home you

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,560
take the polls you're fine

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
and that is the traditional clinical

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
health care

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
and this happens after a drug hits the

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,039
market after

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,840
someone was born and they were

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,360
reasonably healthy but then they got

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,960
sick but what happens when you are born

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
sick

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
when there is no treatment for your

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
condition

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
what do you do in that case you go to

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
biotech

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,600
you go to the pre clinical set of health

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,680
care where you ask

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
biotech companies hey pfizer hey

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
novartis

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
hey big biotech companies in the world

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
can you please

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,160
find a drug for this medical condition

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
just like you've done

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,120
for other thousands of other conditions

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,639
just like the koi vaccine for example

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,639
was born out of biotech

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,919
but unfortunately for over 7 000 rare

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,319
diseases

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:51,680
affecting 400 million patients worldwide

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,319
95 of them do not have any treatments

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,800
and i'm talking about 400 million

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,039
patients worldwide not having treatments

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
and if you put all of them together into

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
a country

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,919
this is the third largest country in the

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,319
world that we're talking about

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
and unfortunately most of these diseases

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,840
will not have a treatment in the next

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,639
several years

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,199
and all of these patients would probably

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,319
die

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,160
just hoping for a treatment

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,599
and so now my question is why can't the

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,080
biotechs help us

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
well they're really eager and anxious to

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
help us

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
but unfortunately the economics don't

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
allow it

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,759
for my son's condition there is nine

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,280
patients worldwide

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360
and if a company was to invest hundred

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
million dollars to find a treatment for

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
nine patients

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
how much would they have to charge each

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,919
one of us what is the risk that they're

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
taking on

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,479
it is just impossible but how do we then

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
end up getting treatments for all of

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,039
these patients

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,000
the answer is we put the power of

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,160
building treatments

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
in the hands of patients and that's

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
precisely what i'm doing with open

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,960
treatments

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,039
and again this is not a new movement

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
this is how aids got their treatment 20

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,080
years ago

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
this is how spinal muscular atrophy got

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
their treatments

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,440
decent muscular dystrophy progeria there

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,919
are there are a lot of what you call

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
really really rare conditions that you

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,960
know nobody would care about

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
today i have treatments because patients

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,160
led the charge and patients or parents

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,319
like me

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
you know would start a foundation would

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,680
raise a lot of money would go invest in

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
academic research

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,280
um they would urge the biotech

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
institutions to take up the research

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,240
that they have they have created so far

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
be risk it for them

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
and then the companies would go through

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,599
the fda to get an approval to make a

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
drug available to market

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
so what we are doing with open

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,159
treatments foundation

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
is mechanizing the the process of

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,959
finding a treatment

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
the process of creating a drug using a

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,640
software platform

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,760
and so if you think about how treatments

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
are built today there's a lot of

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,680
serendipity involved

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,399
right when i when i found a drug for my

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
son

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
i was just incredibly lucky because

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
someone had done the research and posted

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
it online

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,519
and not every not every parent or not

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,760
every disease can get lucky

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
and we cannot rely on luck or hope being

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,839
a strategy

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,360
for saving our loved ones and so through

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,200
open treatments foundation we are

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,040
building a software platform

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
that will empower patients and

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,040
patient-led organizations

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,519
to go build a treatment for that

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
condition and we provide them a very

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,959
clear roadmap

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,880
starting with one particular technology

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,240
called gene therapy we provide them a

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
very clear roadmap

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,680
to build the treatment starting from

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
scratch to going all the way to dosing

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,920
their first patient

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
we also connect them with a global

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,200
talent pool of people

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
that are necessary for them to advance

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
these programs because when you think

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
about patients leading the charge

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,120
they don't have all the expertise

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,480
themselves they need to create a team

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
they would typically have a team of

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
scientific expertise from academic

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,200
institutions

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
but they but they usually lack the drug

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
development process expertise

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,680
which is what we provide as a supplement

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
and then we also connect them with

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,800
infrastructure through contract research

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,240
organizations

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
through academic institutions through

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
core facilities to manufacturing

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,440
organizations

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
that will allow them to to execute their

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
activities like how a sophisticated

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
biotech would do

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
and so with these three pillars through

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
the roadmap through people

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,440
and infrastructure we hope to create a

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,079
more efficient drug development process

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
that will help us get to treatments six

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,440
months sooner

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,360
eight months sooner two years sooner and

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
that's patients getting treatments

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
that much faster now can you talk about

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
your in

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,720
you know association with linux

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,399
foundation how are you seeking their

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
help and how are they helping you so

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,600
when i started this i when i got this

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,519
idea of starting a

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
software project to help help help

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,760
patient foundations

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
i knew it had to be open source um

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,279
because

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,120
this problem is way beyond one person to

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,800
tackle one foundation to tackle this is

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
an ecosystem problem

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,839
we as humanity should come together to

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,000
tackle this problem

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
and what better way to do that without

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
open source

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,360
so if i can build a software platform

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
and make it available for the community

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,640
to take it forward

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,560
even if my foundation doesn't exist 10

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
years from now even if i don't exist 10

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,120
years from now

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,200
someone else could pick it up and run

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,200
with it and this is precisely why

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
um why we wanted the project to be open

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
source so

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,959
i i talked to linux foundation about

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,440
this and they were incredibly supportive

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,360
of this project so they helped spin up a

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
completely separate project under there

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
under their

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,560
umbrella called rar camp and all of the

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
source code that we are building as a

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,760
part of open treatments foundation

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,240
is hosted under rare camp and we made it

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,680
so that this is under apache 2.0 license

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
that anybody else can

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,279
can use for both commercial or

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
non-commercial purposes

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,720
as long as they abide by the license all

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,279
of the data that we share

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
is under creative commons so it is it is

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,440
free for anybody to use

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
and reuse without without really

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
worrying about

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,120
intellectual property and we did this

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680
specifically because we wanted

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,279
um the community to take take this

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,360
project forward

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
and nx foundation is helping build that

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
foundation build that community through

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,760
their

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,519
through the expertise of of building and

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
maintaining open source communities over

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
20 years

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,079
they also have a huge expertise on

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,839
bringing companies together

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,680
to invest in some of these open source

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
projects to make them

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,680
move forward and you can take an example

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
as docker for example there are several

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
companies

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
that are part of the cloud native

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,839
computing foundation they're advancing

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,200
the cloud native ecosystem forward and i

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,480
hope one day

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,800
that rare camp will have a community of

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
com

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
companies that are interested in

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
advancing random diseases forward

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,680
through software

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,680
and that's precisely why i wanted linux

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
foundation to be a part of this

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,279
and that is where they are helping us

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,200
out do you have any specific

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
road map for this project what does it

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,519
look like so we plan on launching this

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,560
project

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,320
uh by the first week of april um

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,839
and we have um i i intentionally made

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,440
the decision that we need

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,760
to build a community of software

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,880
developers empowered to tackle rare

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,519
diseases

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,639
and so right now i have a team of 15

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,360
plus

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,079
software engineers product managers ux

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,959
designers content writers scientists

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,480
a variety of people that are helping us

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,680
build the software platform

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,440
uh for us to launch so we will have um

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,240
the product launched by the first week

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,399
of april at which point we hope to have

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,320
three to five patient foundations that

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
will be using the product um

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,079
to to start building their gene therapy

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
treatments

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,600
and then once we start once we launch

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,839
this in april

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
we have a pretty lofty roadmap that we

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,720
want to tackle going forward

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,720
but my focus will continue to be on

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
on creating a movement for software

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,760
engineers to come and contribute to this

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,800
ecosystem

00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,399
because i believe we have the skill

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,560
to build tools to help rare diseases

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,480
and how did humanity develop and become

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,279
become so good today

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
is because the early man's built tools

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,880
and software engineers are

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
sort of the new tool makers of the world

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,760
and i want

really appreciate not only for taking

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,519
time out

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,519
to talk about the project but also

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,320
starting something which is going to

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
help not only

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,839
your son but a lot of other kids around

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,680
the world

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
who need such kind of help and it's a

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,680
small movement but

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,839
you are absolutely right that we need

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,160
just the way we have democratized

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,199
uh core technologies that our lives

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,480
depend on

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,120
uh we also need to democratize a health

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,399
care

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
uh healthcare should be not only a human

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
right

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,120
we should not have to worry about basic

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,800
things we should we should

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,720
only think we should have to worry about

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,160
is look up at the starts and plan how to

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
go there we should not have to worry

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,639
about

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,399
feeding our kids or keeping our kids

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,000
safe for educating them

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,279
this is not a what civilized society

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,639
should look like

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,720
so so thanks for starting that

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,880
initiative because i do feel that

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
this will trigger this might trigger a

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,680
much larger

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,040
