[Music]

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:20,590
jump right into it this project is under

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:24,550
the FTX program cloud service

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:27,160
certification so all that is is an idea

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,630
concept that came up with as I was

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,179
consulting with many banks around the

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,760
world and seeing the same problem which

00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:38,230
is everybody is having a novel approach

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,780
to certifying or building secure

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,960
configurations to be able to use a cloud

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:50,050
service whether it be Amazon Google as

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,879
your Red Hat whoever so given that banks

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,140
are moving very very slowly not suspect

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,879
but really any company I've worked with

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,359
is moving very very slowly into the

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,760
cloud so kind of built up a process a

00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,969
series of artifacts documents code

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,259
behavior driven development things that

00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:10,780
will create high levels of assurance

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,700
with your compliance teams your security

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,979
teams because it's all provable and

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,530
repeatable rather than just

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:21,250
documentation that's outdated time you

00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,759
create it so with that this project

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,329
because essentially JPMorgan coming out

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,119
I work for right now is not trying to

00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:32,799
differentiate or finding this is a

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,329
competitive differentiator between US

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,490
and other banks being able to use cloud

00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,689
services themselves is not something

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,329
that we find to be a competitive

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,149
advantage also the amount of effort it

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:45,549
takes just to build these one by one by

00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:47,380
one is a really inefficient use of time

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,960
considering we're all trying to do this

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,759
at the same time hence open source it

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,460
work with the other banks collaborate

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,180
together get a lot more done spend less

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,439
money and turns out fin offs and other

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,030
banks thought this was a good idea so

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,549
here we are so I'm going to dive right

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,670
into it I like to do q and A's so I'll

00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:09,690
stop and ask questions or allow for

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,740
questions so just be ready for that I

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,030
think the slide decks are available but

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,600
I mean feel free to take pictures and

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,560
things like that

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,800
so the repos have changed over time

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,020
because I think of in us you know

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,250
normalized everything the second one

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,840
under there is actually our first

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,680
contribution from some of the vendors

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,650
that are contributing to the project

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,270
which is great because obviously vendors

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,800
want to take on what the banks are

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,630
saying this is what we need to be

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,470
compliant to use cloud services some of

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,450
the vendors that are participating

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,470
actually building products on top of

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,330
this immediately for sale Google Groups

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,740
and wiki this is standard throughout all

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,150
the finished projects so if you're

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,950
familiar this is nothing new

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,420
if this is the first time you're exposed

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:56,050
to it this is kind of how we communicate

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:58,030
all right cloud services our bank if

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,010
you're working at a bank you know that

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,060
sometimes this can be a daunting task

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,510
it's very difficult to get approved or

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:11,970
it's just a flat-out no so this project

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,950
is how do we go about building the

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,320
configurations proving that it is

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,360
compliant to existing control frameworks

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,470
and then making it repeatable and

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,530
sharing it out in an open source way the

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,910
culture of no I think everybody that has

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,440
been doing this knows about this already

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,610
because when they are asked to present

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,070
their idea to an architecture or a

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,180
reboard or central cyber or something

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,970
like that they usually get a no and

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:43,300
that's not usually followed by a why

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,710
it's just know and when you dig into

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,750
that a lot of times people find that

00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,710
it's not because they really don't want

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,640
to do it just because I don't yet know

00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,010
how to do it

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,870
so again a competitive differentiator

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,040
I'm moving around because the lights are

00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:00,310
really bright so now since I can see I

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,770
can see if you're sleeping so the point

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,600
of this is we want to use cloud we all

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,660
want to use cloud we have to be able to

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,960
do it in a regulatory compliant way and

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:13,480
again working together we can do this in

00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,530
a more effective and a larger impact way

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,109
so changing the culture of no to a

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,430
culture of yes the story of how we did

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:23,020
this at JPMorgan about going to a little

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,550
bit about that and then I'll dive into

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,450
the technical details of each artifact

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,100
and

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,920
could have a little bit of QA but

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,110
essentially about two years ago started

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,320
on this idea of hey wouldn't it be great

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,460
if all this stuff that cyber is telling

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,260
us to do we could just codify it and

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,950
that way because we're software

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,290
developers we know what the hell we're

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,730
talking about because whatever they're

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,750
saying doesn't make any sense to me and

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,960
whatever I'm saying doesn't make any

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,360
sense to them so that was the premise

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,280
yeah that's good idea so we started

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,290
building that and as we started building

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,930
it we go okay we're meeting with our

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,630
compliance teams we're large control

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,280
frameworks all this fun stuff what does

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,010
that mean when we're talking about clout

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,510
what does that mean when it looks like

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,000
code so instead of a high-level

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:16,660
statement says data must be encrypted to

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,060
enforce data security standards okay so

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,860
in the past that was roll-your-own

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,640
encryption well I think a lot of people

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,190
think that's a bad idea

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,530
great okay so now I just turn on

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,290
encryption okay but where does that

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,800
really work does it work this is why

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,290
this sort of stuff working it down into

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,360
behavior driven development methods

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,130
performs the actions and tells you does

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,730
it actually work not that it was

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,800
configured to work I hope it works but

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,350
it actually does it work and it has

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
proof and you could repeat it so that's

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,530
what this project is about when you're

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,090
trying to change the culture from a

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,100
culture of no to a cultural yes I

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,020
guarantee you having proof and having it

00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,580
be repeatable will get you there a lot

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:03,790
faster well so we got here what's the

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,320
benefits a lot of times I'm not going to

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,730
read these because you'll have this and

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,450
you know you can read the bullet points

00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:13,210
the benefit has been shown already by

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,300
doing this one we're using cloud

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,560
services so that's the main benefit

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,080
that's where we want to be and that's

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,320
where we're getting ancillary benefits

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,600
we're getting there a lot quicker we're

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,690
getting there quicker and we actually

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,770
have code which I'll think a lot of you

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,930
have experienced

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,190
yep I've done my research I've made my

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,350
argument I've pitched the architecture

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,650
review committees and they said sure go

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,580
ahead and try your idea in a sandbox did

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,740
you know what you were doing when

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,169
turned it on no because you've never

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,639
used it before and that's why you've

00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,680
never been on allowed to promote your

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,629
ideas into higher-level environments

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,740
because there's no infrastructure

00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,990
there's no security there's no

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,500
architecture built around it

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:59,770
this project is building those things so

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,840
that you can go to your arabes or cybers

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,469
whoever is approving this idea and

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,419
saying I can prove this works I've used

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,069
this I know how this actually works and

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,810
where things that we didn't know about

00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,849
before we need to pay attention to now

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,930
so that's the big difference of this

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,580
project and that's really some of the

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,490
major benefits you're going to get from

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,669
this participating in the project is

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,789
going to apply another benefit it's not

00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:26,530
just you saying I believe this is

00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:29,440
something that's gonna be compliant it's

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,090
not going to be my bank believes this is

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,430
gonna be something compliant it's going

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,219
to be JP Morgan it's going to be

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,419
Deutsche Bank it's going to be City it's

00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,189
going to be cap one it's going to be

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:43,020
whoever else is participating the

00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:45,789
project already and that's the value

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,349
that this collaboration is going to

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:48,990
bring because it's the weight of an

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,800
industry that's ultimately going to say

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,800
we believe this

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
we've peer reviewed it this works and

00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,669
that's going to help you move a lot

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,110
quicker what I'm gonna get into here the

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,020
process to solve the problem and things

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,270
like that I'm gonna pause here ask your

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:12,819
room does everybody know what I'm

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:16,000
talking about right now looks good don't

00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:21,330
be shy I see you on your laptop back

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,330
there okay that's fine

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,870
processing the problem so I think the

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,370
problem everybody already knows what it

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,159
was what it is what we were working on

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,900
how do we get this into be a process and

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,870
a procedure rather than just an idea and

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,219
a concept after you go through and break

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,899
down your control framework and say

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,019
these are all the controls that we've

00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,490
had in the past for our on-prem

00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,260
environments this is what that looks

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,449
like

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,670
codified for cloud services or the cloud

00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:50,680
services that I'm talking about I need

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,880
to turn this into something I can churn

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,790
out and repeat and have

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,800
our process know what to expect know how

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,520
to interpret it and then know how to

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,930
approve it so that's what again this

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,940
project is starting to build towards we

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,520
have defined artifacts a defined

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,260
contribution model the roles that you're

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,060
going to contribute in and what those

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,650
outputs are going to be so as we can

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,990
start to repeat that we're gonna start

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,050
to churn out a lot more content I can

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,390
tell you at JPMorgan once we started

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,760
creating these our internal compliance

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,010
team and our architect review boards

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,010
when they solve this content coming in

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,500
they knew they had less of a fight to

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,750
put up because it was proven they were

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,480
happy to receive the actual data and

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,070
facts rather than a sales deck which i

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,240
think is a lot of what people get when

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,740
they're in our critical review boards

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,570
it's only the best of what they have

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,210
they offer they kind of forget to

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,960
mention all the warts so when you have

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,010
it code driven and repeatable process

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,440
people have a higher level of assurance

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,930
and Trust which is again change the

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,500
culture get things moving quicker so

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,850
that is some of the things there so I've

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,470
talked about it let's start looking at

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:05,590
some of the stuff so the major artifacts

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,830
are going to be the first one is

00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:13,070
basically a big text document it's going

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,830
to say for this cloud service this and

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,410
the major areas of security concerns

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,110
that we have and compliance concerns

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,580
here's a highly opinionated document

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,550
that says here's how you do this with

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,250
reference material pretty simple stuff

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,270
it gets you to about from zero days of

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,470
experience about nine months of

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,180
experience that's the intent of the

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,200
document so if you've never used the

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,150
service before and you read this

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,520
document and follow all the references

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,100
you're gonna gain the insight from about

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,270
nine months of working with that service

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,270
the next artifact is going to be

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,980
something something like this where

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,110
about the major area of security domain

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,120
encryption of data at rest everybody has

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,450
that in some language in their control

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,970
framework at their bank or institution

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,160
the control standard again high level

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,570
and then you're going to break it down

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,350
all the way to the behavior driven

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,390
development

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,230
that's like gherkin who uses gherkin

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:16,700
process right now - not very many okay

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:19,430
three awesome so generally this is a

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,890
game changer for your interactions with

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,780
your compliance and security teams you

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,620
can have a conversation with them in

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,510
plain language and say I want data that

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,480
comes from this data classification or

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:35,450
this application or this environment to

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,940
be encrypted so that nobody can look at

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,350
it or so that something whatever the

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,540
scenario that they want to come up with

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,400
in plain language again which is why

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,260
that interaction changes a lot between

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,100
compliance and security and your ad

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,960
team's app dev teams because this is a

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,700
way to communicate more effectively then

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,910
you generate the code that performs this

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,950
action so again what's not shown in this

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,320
slide right now is like the terraform

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,270
script the implementation so that is the

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,520
straight-up code that we're all used to

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:09,710
seeing and the pot the process before

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,450
was just to lint or filter that code and

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,700
see if there's a one or a zero somewhere

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,460
where you wanted it to be though that's

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,470
great but that says I intend for this to

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,300
work because if that's the way the

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,600
documentation told me it would work but

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,550
I have no assurance or guarantee without

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,100
performing these BDD tests that it

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,110
actually worked so again this project

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,330
that part right there is the main reason

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,800
why this is more valuable than what

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,000
other projects that you might look like

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,820
oh this kinda like that oh this is kind

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,450
of like that this is why this project is

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,580
different so now I can go through here

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,820
and say a user attempts to save data

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:51,260
specifying this encryption method should

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:54,530
be rejected so what I'm saying there

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,770
I've translated from I only want this

00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,030
encryption method allowed that's to valt

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,070
statement is usually what you get from

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,550
your security department this is

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,240
actually saying okay as an application

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,090
developer

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,920
I have user functionality requirements

00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,870
and I'm actually building the action

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,700
capabilities of what the application can

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,550
do this language helps you actually

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:20,950
perform the test to know this works this

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,950
doesn't work any questions here

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:37,680
so with these you put in the expected

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,060
outcome and then you when you're writing

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,560
out your control standard you're

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,309
actually gonna have more detail put in

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,920
there to say this should do this for

00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:49,439
this service it's very much more

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,579
specific so the outcome is I expect this

00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,920
to be failed in the API call and then

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,329
you could automatically looked at or if

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,990
you're going to interrogate a service

00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:03,149
configuration you can perform these

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,279
tests and see if it actually did it or

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:11,660
not is that specific enough or do you

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,660
want okay another question

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:29,399
so this can be implemented in your

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,949
pipeline so as you're building it that's

00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,290
more of the linting and things like that

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:37,069
we actually built out a virtualized

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,569
environment initially to test this and

00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,579
that's not part of this project because

00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:43,350
that's more of the in product solution

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,740
we're just building the content so we

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,990
know how it's supposed to be configured

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,959
it's also we've implemented it runtime

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:56,160
real time so continuous all the time

00:14:51,959 --> 00:15:19,879
any more questions here so go ahead

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:24,230
milady the first place right

00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:28,439
all right so yes these things can be

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:32,519
reworded remove SS es3 put in language

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:34,980
for Google or edger the assumption that

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,939
it's encrypted all the time it's a nice

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:43,279
low like slogan test test test you'll

00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,279
find in some situations no

00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:03,089
all right so you're jumping towards the

00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,879
end of why with the project is going to

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,199
be valuable I'll get to it I'll answer

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,399
that question later I'm going to keep

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,699
moving because I don't have a whole lot

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,470
of time left and I will take questions

00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:16,169
after the survey mary has questions so

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,329
as we get into filling this stuff out

00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,970
the first artifact is just kind of the

00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:25,189
highly opinionated with the references

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:28,049
we all get that we can get in to

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:29,999
terraform we know what terraform scripts

00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:32,699
or this is a cloud formation example

00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,559
really so what are you gonna use to

00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,839
implement the service there's going to

00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,679
be that so basically i've read the

00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,359
document great i'm an ad so i really

00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,519
don't care about that so much i want to

00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:47,489
press go and try it out that's what this

00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,679
does gets you using the service very

00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:52,109
rapidly with the pre-configured settings

00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:56,100
that you need to have there to be secure

00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:57,839
or compliant bdd we've already kind of

00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,519
talked about what BDD is so I'm gonna

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,350
kind of move quickly through this but

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,309
essentially everything we tested like

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:07,470
code because it is code so that's the

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:11,100
big game changer here is we stopped

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,559
talking just big words fancy language

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,870
written documents it's code we no longer

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,630
have time to sit and have these

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,250
conversations and have one-off reviews

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,970
for each architecture for each

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,919
application

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,260
there's requirements and then there's

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,889
the code to test it and as long as we

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,019
test and we trust the tests and the

00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:33,120
evaluations and the results we can move

00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,500
more rapidly and that's what at the

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,500
heart of this is what we're trying to do

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:44,250
okay examples very basic but essentially

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,000
we're saying here again plain language I

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:52,679
want to deploy an sqs stack correctly in

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,399
the US and non-us region so a lot of us

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,279
are going to be regulated by data

00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:01,820
residency rules and regulations so this

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,750
is a very relevant thing for most of us

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,220
scenario outline I'm going to create the

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,590
SQS CFN stack

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,750
us and non-us regions given that I have

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,240
validated US credentials and with

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,320
privileges to use cloud formation these

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,260
are the types of things kind of set up

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:22,230
the scenario of how this action could

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:25,710
occur when I try to deploy the regional

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:29,490
SQL stack in region then the stack

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,650
creation should result you you're

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,690
setting this up if it should fail it

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,990
should pass something should happen and

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,240
then the example results and this is

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,870
again you're running this against

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,760
architectures you want to be able to see

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,140
succeed fail whatever depending on what

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,570
you've approved or what you expect to

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,809
happen so as long as you can repeat that

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,669
and see it every single time that builds

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,260
the confidence in the people who have

00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:02,400
said no it changes the culture very

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:05,610
rapidly okay I'm gonna move so we we've

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,950
built this this project is not about the

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,140
tool we've built internally this project

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,780
is about how we build the configuration

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,980
documents the artifacts the BDD

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,320
scenarios and things like that we're

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,580
partnering with other banks as I

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,500
mentioned like there's several other

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:24,510
banks and vendors already involved today

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:29,220
I'd like to take a quick pause here and

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:31,559
ask a participant Russell Greene from

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,419
Deutsche Bank to just say a few words

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,530
about his participation so did we have

00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,890
that Mike does it work yep thank you

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,710
Jason

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:43,140
um yeah Jason just wanted to bring

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,679
someone else on the stage to say a

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:49,230
couple of words about the project one

00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,210
just you know for us to participate

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,190
deutscher within a program like this is

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,770
great because we're stealing a lot i

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,600
mean boring a lot of ideas and jason's

00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,429
hard work over the last couple of years

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,270
and how it's doing this but in order to

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,890
put the structure together in order to

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,890
for us to start our cloud journey who

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,890
not started but continued it is is very

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,820
exciting so JP and Jason have been

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,039
looking at this on one particular

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,780
platform it just happens that we are

00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,360
working towards looking at this on

00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,870
another plan

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,640
form so as we you mentioned the services

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,890
are all unique to the platform providers

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,799
and stuff like that what we'd like to do

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,870
is contribute back taking this IP to

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,850
another platform so allowing us two

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,470
different banks to be able to move

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,200
quickly between platforms and have those

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,600
offerings rather than having the six 12

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,790
months for every service so for us and

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,850
then also that allows us potentially to

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,530
move on to AWS a lot more quickly as

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,440
part of ours but you know we have been

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,440
through the journey of convincing the

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,870
control functions of security and

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,370
obviously going forward the regulators

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,780
and also we deal with different

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,970
regulators all the time so there are

00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,010
lots of different problems about which

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,330
region you run in so you may have

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,419
different standards for different

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,370
regulators as well but I don't want to

00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,870
steal the thunder but if we can do this

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,669
successfully together and articulate

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,370
well good standard is for this type of

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,919
environment then we have a lot of voice

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,830
in the industry to convince people to

00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,260
conform to take this away from us so

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,760
that we start to we start to see the

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,710
benefits and we don't do ourselves all

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,700
the time they understand what's

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,020
important when they bring on new

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,910
services because they are all the time

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,230
where hundreds of services and we're

00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,760
never gonna keep track of those if it

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,120
takes us 912 months to adopt these

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,470
services just ain't gonna happen so very

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,900
excited to be part of it thank you very

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,640
much for standing it up and looking

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,990
forward to actually I'm you know

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,730
contributing something back which we

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,880
haven't done yet so I have to be honest

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,390
about that there being modest um thank

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,690
you Russell

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:52,750
so he led into a little bit of your

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,380
question there the long-term goals of

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,570
this project

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,980
obviously the short-term is build these

00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,590
artifacts get the configuration guides

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,679
out their peer review them get more

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,210
people contributing once a week build a

00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,880
critical mass and we have enough

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,429
contribution through the industry we can

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,590
push back on the cloud service providers

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:15,669
and say it should not take us as a

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,370
customer nine months or longer just to

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:22,600
begin to use your service you should be

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:26,559
doing this for us also the next phase of

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,480
that we're getting leverage on the cloud

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,400
service providers and they're helping us

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,260
out more

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,230
we're all using this and we've agreed

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,300
that the configurations are more

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,309
effective meaning codified controls are

00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,620
helping us accelerate and get product

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,590
out the door more quickly and we feel

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,410
that we have a better ability to know

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,510
where we are compliant and non-compliant

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:51,120
continuously rather than on whatever

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:54,450
interval that we assess or review our

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,260
applications we bring that back to our

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:00,059
regulators and say we as an industry

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,970
believe this is better and we would like

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:05,550
you to adopt it can we help you so

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,900
that's where this is going and it's

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,210
going to be a little ways away Intel

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,950
work total there but I think if we can

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,890
start to build some steam build some

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,260
momentum build content and show value

00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,690
meaning yes we're rolling these things

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,429
out we're using it people are starting

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,320
to build tools vendors are starting to

00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:24,360
sells products because they're consuming

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,920
this I think that's all going to help

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,970
build the project and help us all out

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:33,120
quite a bit all right so all these

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,100
things are what JP was able to see as

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,140
benefits at the end of the project and I

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,050
just don't say end as and it's over

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,700
we're done we're still in need of all

00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,020
these hundreds of services across all

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,790
the cloud service providers we're still

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,470
in need of improvements because the

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,170
services are always improved and new

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,820
features emerged so this is a continuous

00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,490
cycle and that's the other part of

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,730
having some github is we can actually

00:23:53,490 --> 00:24:00,030
show commits show changes when that

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:03,660
triggers a peer review process or we

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:05,429
start creating lists of hey there's a

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,830
new feature in this service who wants to

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:09,540
pick that up that's where the project's

00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,700
all about so this talk if nothing else

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,160
is kind of a call to action request for

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,600
help and just informing you this is out

00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,670
there this can be really helpful I'm

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,610
looking for more participation or at

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:25,710
least just if you have a better idea or

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:30,480
a bunch of content love to see it that's

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,340
kind of where we are right now kind of

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,740
cover a little bit and already so right

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,690
now I have a minute or less any

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,690
questions okay

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:50,880
we're delivering the stories these are

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,510
stories and the BDD scenarios so the

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,060
tooling is left out of this project

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,590
specifically because I like the vendor

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,610
participation and they want the ability

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:04,530
to salt so there's that and as well as

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,420
everybody's so unique this was a

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,040
conscious design choice with the project

00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,210
initiation because everybody's on a

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:14,070
different platform different pipeline so

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,870
as you can see people are upset like but

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:20,600
I don't use that every us like okay so

00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,600
let's let's do Google as your whatever

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,570
right

00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:59,990
alright so I'm running a little bit over

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,910
time having an open source having the

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,710
code they're having it peer reviewed by

00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,200
multiple banks where hopefully can you

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,179
avoid situations like that as far as

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,520
when you consume it inside your own

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,470
walls and people understand it or don't

00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,850
understand it I can't solve everything

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:19,400
with a project so I can get us so far or

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,230
help fix that problem so far just

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,820
because it once it's in code and it's

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,580
not someone's individual interpretation

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,679
of some high level language code is

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,350
pretty universal either does it or it

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,370
doesn't and that that's just that's as

00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,910
far as I'm trying to take this right now

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:39,490
I think I'm over time but if there's any

00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,490
questions I'll sit outside or something

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:55,929
