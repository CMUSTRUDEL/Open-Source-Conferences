[Music]

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:20,750
so I'm Nick Koba i am the co-founder and

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,430
the lead on the FTC three group within

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,830
finis i'm going to talk to you today

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,949
about the experience of building FTC

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,439
three over the past two years and what

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,980
we can apply to other standards efforts

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,820
both in and outside of fan finance but

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,250
before I get to that I wanted to demo

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,809
some of the concepts that really drove

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,690
the inspiration for up Tuesday three Oh

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:50,780
Siri come on it's not about you okay so

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,440
I'm going to cut over to machine here

00:00:50,780 --> 00:01:00,480
and what we see now warning this is just

00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:04,260
me hacking on open Finn open Finn's fdz

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,799
three implementation as well as a bunch

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,100
of web platform stuff CSS vanilla

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:17,369
JavaScript etc so please be kind

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,939
so FDC three is composed of three main

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,920
parts that support the standards the

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:33,390
first one is an app directory standard

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:37,280
and what we see here nice is this is why

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,280
one should not use they're dumb and

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:46,500
beautiful okay so what we see here is a

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:51,649
app directory that is going to a service

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,649
that returns a bunch of metadata around

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:59,070
around the identity of these

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,149
applications as well as the kinds of

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,460
things that they support so these little

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,020
icons here actually indicate what FTC

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,390
three intents are supported by these

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,420
applications you can see view news for

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,920
you contact

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,860
view social

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,069
and view chart for this charting

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,739
application some of these are standard

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,140
FTC 3 intents like for you chart view

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,989
news some of them are ones that I've

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,780
invented that exist in my desk top agent

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:33,840
which is the term in FTC 3 for a

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,390
platform that implements FTC 3 like view

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,890
contact and view social so I've brought

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,010
up this blotter chart which I built

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,080
actually using an off-the-shelf Ageing

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,060
grid component and it's really simple

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,420
this is just a bunch of people involves

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,030
FTC 3 actually and I'm just using it as

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,260
a sort of starting point to show some of

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,760
the intense functionality so if I go

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,530
here to view chart I'm now going to

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,750
raise an intent for viewing a chart so

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,610
this application that's living in its

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,950
own world it's gonna say hey I want to

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,840
view a chart for Apple and when we click

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,940
on this I now actually get a choice of

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,530
charting applications I can use to

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,080
fulfill this intent because there's

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,390
actually two different applications in

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,769
my directory that support for you chart

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,340
I'm going to choose the training view

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,410
chart it's going to route not just the

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,329
intent but also the context around that

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,420
intent to that chart I'm now going to

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:34,109
see a chart for Apple if I click on

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,950
another instrument like Microsoft it's

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:41,070
gonna broadcast that out using FTC

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,049
threes API again and this totally

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,890
separate charting application is going

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:51,750
to get that context and load up the new

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,519
context and in response I can also raise

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,350
other intents like for example his few

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,720
social thing I totally made up

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,220
I can see social data for this

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,690
instrument in this case I'm going to

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,620
look at stock twits I now load the stock

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,880
twits application and again these things

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,019
know nothing about each other and it's

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,510
been passed over the Google context is

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,019
now I'm now viewing both a chart and

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,329
some information from stock puts on

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,289
Google and I can actually again

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,490
broadcast context and move that around

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:29,819
now I'm looking at Amazon

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,120
so I can also do other things right

00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:36,169
let's say I want a view a contact right

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,090
so there's other this view contact

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:42,750
intent I've created which also is using

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,020
the standard contact context data type

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,819
from FD XIII I can again open this up

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,860
and I get some choices of things that

00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:51,660
will fulfill this intent I'm gonna look

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,880
at Rico on LinkedIn he spoke earlier

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,800
today I hope you guys caught that it was

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,460
a really good talk

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,620
and now I'm looking at Rico's profile on

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,910
LinkedIn it looks like I have a message

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:12,860
and I can even now I'm gonna raise an

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:17,180
intent for view social on adaptive and

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:21,659
pass it over to LinkedIn and get this

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,130
information on adaptive which is you can

00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:26,840
see how this you can start to build

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,280
really seamless workflows across

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,880
applications that don't necessarily know

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,699
anything about themselves using this so

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,849
that was the second part of FTC 3 which

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,990
is intense and context data which is one

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:43,020
of the central things that the app

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:48,389
directory houses for us though it can

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:51,090
also come dynamically as well so the

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,250
third main part about DC 3 is the API

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,669
and the real purpose of the API is to

00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,509
make it really easy for people to adopt

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:04,409
FTC 3 Union fools like me you can build

00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:06,030
stuff like this and one of the new

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,419
things that we've done with the API is

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,310
create a api for channel linking which

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,169
i'm going to show right now this is a

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:18,210
concept that's usually expressed as

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:23,580
color linking and Finance so if I put

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:25,199
these all onto the red channel I'm

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,409
getting the same behavior as I did

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:35,070
before because I had these things all on

00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:37,790
just broadcast but now I'm gonna open up

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,390
this guy on Apple

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,700
and as I change the red channel this one

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,190
stays the same and in fact I could put

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,900
this onto a green Channel have I

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:54,010
switched my grid over the green Channel

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:56,720
I can now change that context separately

00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,560
so you can see you can start dividing up

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,110
my my applications in two different sets

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,700
of contexts

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,680
now we've seen this now I've just been

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,060
demoing the stuff that I built right for

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,130
a demo and some of these things are

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,560
actually just web applications but

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,750
they're all things within somewhat my

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,420
level of control the really great thing

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,240
about the FDC 3 at this moment now is

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:25,760
that FDC 3 is now live in production

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:32,720
with a number of vendors and companies

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:35,390
within finance so just to end this with

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,700
one last thing which is to show you this

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,560
working with factset so this is facts

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,560
that live in production this is their

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:51,320
news application and I'm gonna put these

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,890
guys all in the red Channel and you can

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,680
see I can move all these apps over to

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,340
Facebook now factset is working in

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,440
concert with this training view app I

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,410
put together the stock twits

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,520
app that I put together and they all

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:13,400
work seamlessly in fact I can search in

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,660
fact set it can raise a new context and

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,240
it gets broadcast to the other

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:21,890
applications and I can even do that from

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,560
the trading view app and you'll see the

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,270
facts that also picks up that context

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,350
you know you can only do this because of

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:36,290
standards like FTC 3 or at least we can

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:38,960
only do it this easily so that's my

00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:45,140
signal to now cut over to talking about

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:48,650
how we got to those standards and sorry

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,060
do I need to do anything or you can you

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,090
cut it over to you back to the slide

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,090
deck

00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:10,340
do I just do this no okay so little

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:13,520
history on F T g3 so f dc-3s existed for

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,650
basically two years we started it was

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,560
started by open fan back in October of

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,050
2017 we had a slide deck and about

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,180
twelve people that we knew and we got

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,830
people together who we felt were

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,780
interested in talking about

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:32,300
interoperability across the industry and

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:37,600
and started working out standards in May

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:40,880
of 2008 we contributed FDC 3 into finis

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,290
at that point we had about 40 firms

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:49,160
participating we had four standards

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,710
working group set up and then by the end

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,510
of 2019

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:58,670
I started 2018 we had standards ratified

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:03,710
for 100 and we released one Oh

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:06,320
in March of 2019 that involved ten core

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:10,610
contributor firms and we had about a

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,140
hundred plus member community at that

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,440
point which is essentially where we are

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,290
today

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,740
though today where we are is that we

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,060
have those standards now in production

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,060
across the industry with leading firms

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,600
like factset you just saw JP Morgan and

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:31,550
open fin which you saw as well and that

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:35,030
puts things at a very exciting place so

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,610
these are some of the firm's that make

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:42,140
up the FTC free community a lot of these

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,780
are kind of they are supporters and

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,030
listening but they're not necessarily

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,340
active members but all these guys have

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:55,100
signed up and are interested in

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:59,840
following this project so how do we do

00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:02,510
this now the title of this talk is you

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,850
know how to create a standards group in

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,500
five easy steps

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,110
and that's a little bit of a

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,139
bait-and-switch sorry

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,089
it's these aren't really five easy steps

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:20,360
they're more of the constellations that

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:25,850
we've used to guide us along the way as

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:28,370
we've built FDC three and it is a very

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,500
iterative process there should be an

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,959
arrow going from the bottom to the top

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,819
but when we move the slides over to get

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:40,790
it on to the screen that arrow got lost

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:44,540
sometimes are these casualties so but

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:47,300
this is a process that has to start

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:51,920
small and repeated over and over and

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:57,410
over again so step one you got to find a

00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:01,850
problem so what is a good problem to

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,199
have four standards interesting fact

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,529
they're about four hundred million

00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,050
pounds of bacon apparently in the u.s.

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,189
reserves today so a lot of people would

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:15,050
consider this a good problem to have

00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:18,470
good problems are obvious and they're in

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,630
your face when it comes to standards you

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,610
don't start standards around shy

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,380
problems those are usually great

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,689
technical problems that you can use to

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,060
build a moat but they aren't good

00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:31,579
standards problems because they don't

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,610
really have the right balance and you

00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:38,689
can't get the stakeholders to the table

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:42,079
this is the world before FDC three this

00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:44,600
is a strong reason why we created FTC

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,319
three you had walled gardens that

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,939
provided Interop within their walls

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:56,290
these might be bloomberg they might be a

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:58,899
roof in ative icon etc etc you then had

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,459
companies like open fin that provided

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:06,139
message bus in platform for applications

00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:07,579
to run and you could have messaging

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,529
between all these applications if

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,110
they're running on open fin and you also

00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:14,120
and you could even run messaging between

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,480
open fan or other things in these walled

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,230
gardens as well as you had a set of long

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,000
tail kind of

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,670
one-off apps running on various

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,180
different technology stacks that you

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,970
also could run pipes between all these

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,030
things the problem is that without a

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:35,150
standard around how you run those pipes

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,770
how applications are identified and what

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,740
the languages that they're speaking over

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,490
those pipes all those integrations have

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,410
to be one-off bilateral agreement so if

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,020
you've worked out ahead of time and that

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,510
becomes really expensive and you leave a

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,270
lot of value on the table most things

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,690
most integrations just didn't happen

00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,800
because they're just too expensive to do

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:03,170
so it really comes down to weighing the

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,270
value of things and I think it's a

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,450
pretty simple equation which is that if

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:11,180
the value of the IP by having the thing

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,130
become a standard is greater than the

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,520
value of the IP for the stakeholders for

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,740
keeping a proprietary then you have

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,570
something that's a good candidate for

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,480
Standardization because people decide

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,850
hey there's no point in competing over

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,200
you know whose message bus what's really

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,200
important is to have a world where we

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,970
can compete over who builds the best

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:37,910
implementation of this kind of new

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:39,590
interoperability engine so step two you

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,000
have to convince the relevant people to

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,030
care

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,880
I like Lawrence I think this is a good

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,860
metaphor it's also you have to be

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,150
willing to walk to Mordor because it's a

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:58,010
really really long road building these

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:59,420
kinds of standards and you have to make

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,590
it interesting because it's a long walk

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,530
to Mordor and this could mean beer but

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,970
it doesn't necessarily mean beer but you

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,450
need to give people a reason to show up

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,190
you need to make the the topics

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,460
interesting and you need to run

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,870
productive and effective meetings and

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:23,720
most importantly you need to build a

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:25,820
really strong sense of community the

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,640
community is really essential it's

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,900
really critical that you can make the

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,779
stakeholders the heroes of

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:38,740
this story and these are some of the

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:40,690
people that have been like key active

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,520
contributors FDC three over the past two

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,029
years someone recognize this has been a

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,610
huge group effort and this is something

00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:53,680
that could not have happened without all

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,839
these people and many more you have to

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,750
ensure neutrality is step three

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,400
right this is absolutely important need

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,930
to be like Switzerland so a big part of

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,690
that is don't start from an existing

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,730
solution commercial or otherwise open

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,089
fin when we created FDC 3 there was

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:17,500
absolutely nothing about open fin in the

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:19,570
definition of FDC 3 at all so then we've

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,630
kept it that way it's it stayed

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,460
completely separated out you also need

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:28,870
to make things open source from start so

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:31,510
FTC 3 again was Apache 2 license day 1

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,089
and his remain says everything that

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:38,320
happens in FDC 3 happens in the open

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:42,060
this is absolutely critical and having a

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:47,020
neutral space like a finis that creates

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:51,070
a great set of governance and structure

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,080
and has a very visible sense of

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,959
neutrality it was also incredibly

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,959
important so contributing FDC 3 into

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,450
finis was really critical for us to

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,059
reach a point of scale with FTC 3 and

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,339
keep it moving forward and to create

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:12,010
assurance that this was going to remain

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:13,780
a neutral standard big part of that you

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,280
know that goes with that is ensuring

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,470
they of multiple and balanced

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,240
stakeholders so if you saw a list of

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,660
stakeholders before you'd see buy-side

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,880
firms sell-side firms vendors content

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:32,230
providers consultancies etc there it's a

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:35,520
wide range of stakeholders that make up

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:42,560
this this community and keep it very

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:44,720
balanced and keeps us honest so step 4

00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,090
to find the least common denominator

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,890
this is incredibly important

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,710
you've to always try to reduce things

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:56,240
down to what's the smallest thing we can

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:59,840
do in terms of creating the standard so

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,570
if you take the position that this that

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,000
the standards have to be all or nothing

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,460
then you will fail this can't be done

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,040
you need to make it the lowest bar

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,230
possible for adoption this needs to be

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,150
super easy so with FTC 3 one of the

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,890
things that we did early on because we

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,690
separate the standards out and two

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,730
separate things as I mentioned before

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:25,960
app directory context data intents API

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:28,040
all those things can be used almost

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,410
independently right you can have an app

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,930
directory for FTC 3 without having the

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,760
other things you can just send FTC 3

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,700
standard context data of your bus and

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,220
have your own API all those things are

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,590
well we'd like you to use everything

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,040
it's it's valid it allows people to come

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,480
in at the level that they can come in

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,060
because remember everybody already has

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,440
their own systems for doing this so if

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,750
you make it so they have to do a lift

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,370
and shift to an entirely new system it's

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,920
just not going to fly kind of going with

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,870
this is you have to separate the

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,790
standards for implementation and and I

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,170
think this is a really to me a powerful

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,520
image because there's like refracting

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,810
light like it's very when you have

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,900
implementation everything is kind of

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:14,810
mixed together and and if you very hard

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:19,490
to extract standards from implementation

00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:22,790
so you you really need to work hard and

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,650
we do this all the time within the group

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,990
is what is the standard we're going

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,570
after but the implement with with this

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,540
use case you know what is implementation

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,430
and what's the actual standard then

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,250
finally if you can't get consensus or

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,380
near consensus on a topic and then it's

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,900
probably just not ready right you're

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,700
gonna get consensus when people are

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,840
ready to really come to the table when

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,420
it's really critical for them to make it

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,960
a standard and that's the right time to

00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:59,030
push that forward so step 5

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:03,600
Oh looks a lot like step one iterate

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:06,660
this is so critical right people don't

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,190
think about this in web in 25 years plus

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:14,130
right of web HTML started with 14 tags

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,990
right they didn't nobody said oh we can

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,070
use this unless we have a way to do

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:22,920
ecommerce or you know blogging or have

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,450
web sockets etc or else we're not going

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,040
to sign up for this thing it started

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:31,140
very very small complexity in the web

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,330
when you look at it it gets pushed to

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,020
the edges to where the implementation

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,120
lives and that is really super critical

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,700
again because it's in the

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,130
implementations that you're gonna work

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,110
out what makes sense it as a standard

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,410
and what doesn't I'm running out of time

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,600
you have to keep knocking on doors this

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,520
is really important again going back to

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,410
community you need to keep iterating on

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,050
community and moving that forward

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,630
reaching out to people those things are

00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,250
fought you know one person at a time in

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:06,330
terms of convincing people and getting

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,460
them to care about these things and you

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,200
know finally you need to iterate off of

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,840
real-world implementations which is the

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,880
point we're at with in FTC 3 today we

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,310
have real world implementations out

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,690
there now and now we're doing the work

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,170
of starting to look at what we've done

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,420
and then figuring out what are the next

00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,640
things that make sense to standardize in

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:31,710
order to move those implementations to

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,770
the next level so in conclusion I think

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,100
that FTC 3 has been a really successful

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,110
project so far it's just at its

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,360
beginning but I think what's really made

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,670
it successful is the framework we've

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,040
created to build community and to

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:50,940
balance political tensions and keep our

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,900
focus on the standards and standards

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,020
that can be adopted by many

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,040
organizations and fit into many

00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:02,340
technical stacks this model can be

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,940
applied across many other efforts in

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:09,000
both finance and outside of it and and I

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,420
think that we can use this to build

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,120
even more value upon open standards open

00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,340
source and open collaboration in finance

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,180
and and I think that it's going to be a

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,360
really exciting year in 2024 FTC 3 thank

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,360
you

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:36,569
