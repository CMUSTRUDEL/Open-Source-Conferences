	Mike Stevenson | Adaptive Financial Consulting | The Next Frontier an Open Source RegTech Stack | FINOS OSSF 2019

Mike Stevenson, Principal Engagement Manager, Adaptive Financial Consulting

Both the buy side and sell side make massive investments into regulatory technology (RegTech), and those investments are nearly always divorced from real competitive advantage. This talk makes the argument that RegTech is a strong candidate to become a utility, and to be open sourced. The requirements of the regulators are standardized - so why can’t the solution be? Recent examples of consortia of financial institutions producing technology platforms for MiFID II are a clear step towards an organization like FINOS - in partnership with a select few leaders in the industry - building a full-service, fully open source, RegTech stack. And, through the open core model, that RegTech stack could provide a framework on which proprietary point solutions could be built, with far lower integration risk. This would be transformative in the industry, and would allow financial institutions to focus much more of their tech spend fully onto differentiation.

[Music]

00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:21,000
incredible I went to see this play or

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,939
music or I should say a couple of years

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,220
back on Broadway is amazing absolutely

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:31,019
loved it never imagined that I'd be on

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,610
the stage for incredible treat so

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,380
talking of incredible treats I really

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,730
want to say that thank you to everybody

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,950
who's come along to hear my thoughts on

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,059
this matter I really appreciate it

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,770
the lineup of speakers is really quite

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,270
impressive in this event so for you to

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,390
come along and listen to my thoughts on

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:53,820
this matter is another treat so thank

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:57,210
you for that introducing myself this is

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,949
my face unfortunately I have been in

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,960
this industry for around about 20 years

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:06,420
and started as a developer and moved

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,360
through to an architect and into a

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,280
project manager and works of both

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,500
vendors have started out a vendor and

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,970
then moved to investment banks now

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,250
adaptive financial consulting and I

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,380
spent much of that career much of that

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,009
time building some form of regulatory

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,470
technology and as you can see here what

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,090
I do at that service that I build and

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,909
responsible for a portfolio of

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,670
large-scale projects for our clients and

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,040
this includes amongst others a major one

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,750
year plus reg tech platform which is

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,159
built for a consortium of clients which

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,299
is very relevant to my proposal here and

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,229
I'm just gonna deal with three questions

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,450
here why is there a problem what do I

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,439
propose to do about it and how would we

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,360
go about doing that thing so pretty

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,960
short list of three questions that we're

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,560
going to deal with in this presentation

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,570
why is there a problem so as you see

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,090
here building an operating reg tech

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,550
platforms of various different types is

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,040
absolutely necessary right if you get

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,829
this wrong the risks

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,510
mence obviously fines but reputational

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:23,819
risk but it's also incredibly costly at

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,780
least two stats really jumped out of me

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,230
when I was thinking about this

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,620
presentation it turns out the 40% of

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,790
new-build spend in the industry is aimed

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,819
at some form of compliance platform and

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,290
firms report anything up to 10% of their

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,540
general revenue being spent on

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:47,819
compliance in some form or another so

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,470
these costs aren't immense building and

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:54,659
operates in these platforms requires

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:57,299
armies of personnel and in many cases

00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,389
these folks they're extremely smart

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,200
extremely dedicated but are also

00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,200
duplicating effort across the industry

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,639
there's a lot of vendor point solutions

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,810
now I should be clear here that some of

00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,819
these vendor Point solutions are

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,470
fantastic right they're really really

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,970
good but at their best they create

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,099
integrations spend an integration risk

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,889
in you've got to get your data into

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,540
these point solutions and you've got to

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,790
somehow get your data out of these point

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,319
solutions it requires new api is that

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,180
you need to contend with new dates and

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,650
models data bases all the rest of it

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,560
you've got to figure out how to

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:41,340
integrate this new asset with your with

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:44,760
your tech stack the expectations for reg

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,430
tech are immense and this five year

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,370
timeline here to me is really important

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,269
it shows to me that every single year in

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,159
this five year blog there's some new

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,540
regulation set which we're going to have

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,370
to contend with and that's going to be

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,889
broad regulation set that we're gonna

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,169
that it's gonna change businesses in

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:06,569
some way or another in terms of being

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,949
able to comply with it and this isn't

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,879
going anywhere this is a trajectory

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,879
that's not going anywhere

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,489
meanwhile we don't have the bandwidth to

00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:22,019
engage with emerging technologies so

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,330
we've got artificial intelligence here

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,099
we've got machine learning we kind of

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,780
all know instinctively that these things

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,389
could really change

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,130
what we do with these massive data sets

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,240
that pump through rape tech platforms we

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,230
could get real insights from this data

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,669
but instead we just don't have the

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,750
bandwidth to contend with it because

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:44,220
we're focusing on compliance includes

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,610
things like know your data rebel to know

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,060
your customer and it includes things

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,320
that we haven't even thought about yet

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,760
categories of approaches and

00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:00,000
technologies that we haven't even

00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:03,419
thought about meanwhile big tech is

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,980
starting to enter the market and this is

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,290
at the moment in the form of you know

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,610
things like white labeling right so you

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,310
know credit cards which are white

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,110
labeled that sort of thing I contend

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,050
that that's a toad dipping into the

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,570
water to figure out how to proceed

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,910
that's like the start of something the

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,280
start of a process rather than the

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:27,750
culmination of a process and these firms

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,720
as we say here they don't have large and

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,130
fractured tech stacks they don't have

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,479
two hundred year histories of

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,700
acquisition like some of the

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,740
organizations in our industry have where

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,380
you know firms have subsumed other firms

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,850
which have their own tech stacks and

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,479
then they need to be integrated with

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,860
your own existing complex tech stack

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,810
they don't have decades old legacy

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,500
systems built in COBOL or Visual Basic

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,789
which is where I started my career but

00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:01,039
they do have determination and deep

00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:03,810
pockets so what is my proposal

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,280
well I think that there are free

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,700
possible futures I think we can be

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,550
disrupted or we can be acquired or we

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,610
can compete and for me

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,919
competing means focusing spend on areas

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,870
for your business that are about

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,820
competitive advantage or about

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:27,390
differentiation and not about utilities

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:33,900
and that begs a question what do I mean

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:36,450
by a utility so this thing is a Wardley

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,940
map which I found really interesting I

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,400
only recently found out about these but

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,509
I think it's a really interesting way of

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,629
representing a mapping value for an

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,159
organization I'd definitely advise you

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,610
to go and learn about these things and

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:53,379
what it's showing here is that a

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,939
regulatory reply reporting platform for

00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,360
example is something that's necessary

00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,919
but it's not differentiating so the

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,689
canonical example of something that

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,919
might be similar would be a data center

00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,689
right we don't want to be in the

00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,240
business of reinventing a data center

00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,919
they just use it as a commodity and I

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,449
contend that a regulatory reporting

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:16,870
platform should really be in the same

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:18,669
category and I'd say that such a

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,580
platform has got a few additional

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,099
requirements it needs to lower costs

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,110
because that's one of the key aims that

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:30,610
we've got we have identified it needs

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,409
transparency of implementation and what

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,930
I mean by that is I'd be worried about

00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:37,300
forcing my data for a red text stack but

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,949
I didn't understand I'd want to know

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,419
what was going on in there just because

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:46,300
of the risk involved I've you know fines

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:50,710
and reputational risk I don't want just

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,120
another vendor relationship and I need

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,250
to use an approach that enables

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,969
efficient knowledge transfer and

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,800
cooperation between organizations that

00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,259
seems necessary if I'm going to get

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,409
involved with other organizations and

00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,729
set this up as a utility with this said

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:09,009
as I've said before there are many

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:12,699
fantastic point solutions out there in a

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:14,740
reg tech world and whatever we do to

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,750
solve this problem it should still allow

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,580
for those point solutions not just for

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,930
vendors but also in-house because there

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,060
may be cases where you'd have point

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,900
solutions in the house that relevant to

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,699
your reg tech stack and I proposed this

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,810
is what the answer might look like so

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:37,360
for me this is an open core model where

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:40,709
you have an open source reg tech stack

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,300
that forms a backbone a framework of

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:46,269
contending with regulatory reporting for

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:50,350
example that's not the only area that we

00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:53,290
could look at and that backbone exposes

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,880
well understood and standard and clearly

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,090
known

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:04,640
api's that vendors and indeed in-house

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:06,080
solutions can integrate with easily and

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,870
we've got two vendors here two different

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,860
vendors offering two different solutions

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,570
over here we've got some proprietary

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,150
point solutions that might be relevant

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,730
to an organization and I think it's

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,440
important to say that I say that there's

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,090
no differentiation that's not quite true

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,620
I can imagine areas where you'd be able

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,890
to differentiate in regulatory

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,810
technology perhaps you know whether

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,990
that's a risk model that you think

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,520
that's you can produce which produces

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,100
insights into your books and you look

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,060
over the same data and apply that risk

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,070
model to it if you've got a clear API

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,080
and a clear standard and a clear

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,180
integration point you can produce these

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,620
point solutions and lower the

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,720
integration risk and the integration

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,480
spend and all of the hassle that comes

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:56,450
with integration integrating with yet

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:59,540
another point solution now I want to

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,250
point out that as it says here this

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,740
isn't a silver bullet right this isn't

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,990
gonna remove costs this isn't gonna

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,760
suddenly save billions across the

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,330
industry overnight all of these

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,420
companies here use this model in various

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,760
different forms and they pay armies of

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,390
developers to contribute to and maintain

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,420
those open core solutions but these are

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,780
smaller armies and these armies would be

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,360
amortized for our our industry because

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,550
we wouldn't have the duplication of

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,140
effort that we've got now in whether

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,060
it's understanding regulations whether

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:41,540
it's producing reports whether it's

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:43,970
developing platforms so you might think

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,790
that well one way that I can contend

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,980
with this problem is that I can just say

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm going to decouple my reg tech stack

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,850
to the extent and I'm able to and I'm

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,380
just gonna open source it I'm just gonna

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:59,330
put it out into the industry I'm gonna

00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:05,600
upload it to github and I'm ready to go

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:08,150
job done and I contend that it it's

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,770
certainly how generally function

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,030
building blocks have been open-sourced

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,130
up to now in the industry that's

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,990
certainly true there are a few counter

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,090
examples of this I think perspective is

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,680
a really good example of a counter

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,310
example it's something that's been quite

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,290
effectively decoupled but in general I

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,530
contend that solutions are coupled

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,290
across a technical dimension a process

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,300
dimension and your operating model just

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,070
a way that you do business right we will

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,250
it's it's like Conway's law right and

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,290
it's also difficult to outline what the

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,450
incentive is for a single firm to do

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,550
this I think it's not impossible

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,490
I think we've sort of seen an example

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,140
earlier on today it's not impossible to

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,940
convince a firm to do this but it's kind

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,940
of a difficult pitch it's difficult sell

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,610
and I suggest that instead what we could

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,090
do is we could have a federated open

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,280
core model which is driven by and

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,380
overseen by a committee of

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,650
representatives across as they say four

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,180
quadrants right so here I've got the buy

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,590
side and I've got a sell side and I've

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,420
got a vendors and regulators all

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:21,350
involved in this committee in one shape

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,690
or form or another and I propose that

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,910
each of these people have got clear

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:30,710
benefits from being involved in such a

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,780
such a federated model lowered costs for

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,050
the buy-side and sell-side is an obvious

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,540
win lower compliance risk is another

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,300
there's not by any means limited to

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,520
these two four vendors there is now a

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,930
clear integration point and you can come

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,450
up with a point solution which is a

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,240
value add and you can say here's our

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,160
point solution and you know that you can

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,440
integrate with it because we're all

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,820
using the same standard it's gonna be

00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,170
easy and straightforward and you can

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:02,600
just plug it in and you're good to go

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,040
meanwhile for the regulator not only do

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,380
you get full transparency so the

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,150
regulator can see okay no and I can see

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,770
how these compliance reports have been

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,570
generated I can see what's going on I

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,680
can see how the sausage is being made

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,110
but they have confidence in your

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,140
compliance and also one thing that I

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,920
think is quite transformative to me as a

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,200
thought is

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,570
I imagine it regulator seen something

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,700
like I want to take a report and I want

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,139
to pivot it slightly right I want to

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,000
take the data and I want to slightly

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:33,920
represent it differently I want to do a

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,240
different calculation whatever it might

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,889
be the process for getting such a change

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,209
fruits in the industry at the moment

00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:44,930
it's quite difficult and time-consuming

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:48,380
and long and I can foresee a future

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:54,860
where a regulate regulator could just

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:57,070
raise a PR now obviously there would

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,690
have to be a governance procedure and

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,010
this PR would go through that governance

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,500
procedure before it started

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,000
proliferating throughout the industry

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,380
but you can imagine the benefits of

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,670
scale that would come with a model like

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,670
that could be incredible

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,860
there we go so I contends that what we

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,200
need to produce produce is an open

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,540
source and open core regulatory tech

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,390
stack which is produced and driven by

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,810
four quadrants so by side sell side

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:42,240
vendors and regulators because everybody

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:45,420
will get benefit from such a platform

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:51,600
but how would we go about this you may

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:53,880
ask so I think the first piece of good

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,950
news to to point out here is that the

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,420
industry as we say is already shown that

00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,970
it's possible to collaborate

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,710
successfully in many different regards I

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,090
think FDC free is a great example of

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:09,060
this trade web is another great example

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,800
there was a regulatory trading platform

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,800
consent in order to reduced by a

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,260
consortium of banks in 2018 which was

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,350
intended to address method two there's a

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,330
regulation set so the industry shown

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,120
that they can collaborate particularly

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,580
where you know the the requirements are

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,550
known the data in is known and everybody

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:34,950
kind of needs the same thing

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:36,300
from such a platform and there's

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,570
certainly things that we need to talk

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,980
about but where to start is one of the

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,420
things that seems to me to be quite

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,450
obvious regulatory reporting feels like

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:53,910
a set of vertical use cases that would

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,950
be quite valuable to start with as I've

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,410
said here the data is going in it's

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,280
fairly standard and fairly standard Lee

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:05,730
shapes like a swaps of swap pretty much

00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,440
a standard outcome is expected of the

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,230
reports that then find their ways

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,810
towards the regulator and given those

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,390
two things an own process must be

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,340
applied to that data so given all of

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,250
that it feels like a set of vertical use

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,890
cases which would be a pretty good start

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:28,590
for such a utility platform we need a

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:31,080
standardized information model and again

00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:34,410
I contend that dozens already exist I

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,400
don't think that we need necessarily to

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,830
create and understand

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,720
there may be tweaks there may be devil

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,380
in the detail of course and glossing

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,210
over a lot of that devil in that detail

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,890
but I think that dozens of information

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,980
models already exist and we can pick one

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,470
to start with so this is not a problem

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:57,090
that I think is existential to the

00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:00,090
approach a technology platform again

00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:03,000
much of the industry agrees on certain

00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:05,730
platforms and languages and tools Java

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,360
is one example like everybody uses Java

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,250
pretty much in one shape or form C++ is

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,750
another example of various different

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,760
things that we kind of know are

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,470
ubiquitous or near ubiquitous in the

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,830
industry and we've agreed on these

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,140
things around data security and privacy

00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:24,390
once again is broad agreement here on

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,920
how to proceed a lot of these

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:31,440
discussions are happening around the

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:34,290
cloud and obviously there are risks and

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,060
questions and things to contend with for

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,280
the industry and figuring out how to

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,230
engage into the cloud but a lot of these

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,220
discussions are being had and it's there

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,750
are pretty straightforward answers and

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,340
finally in my judgment for the

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,100
governance and operating model for

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,080
producing such a platform which is very

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,310
very important very critical I contend

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,950
that finials has already solved this

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,260
problem to a degree I think it's a good

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:07,400
example of an organization which could

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:14,720
produce such a platform so to summarize

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:17,910
my proposal we've got a set of problems

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,490
the chief amongst them arguably being

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,920
cost and obviously the amount of people

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,750
that are involved in producing these

00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,790
wrecked at forms and operating them is

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,640
an element of that cost

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,080
we have integration risk and integration

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,810
spending that comes with integrating

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,940
point solutions for reg tech and that

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:39,030
includes value add differentiating point

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,750
solutions that we might develop

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:45,600
proprietary in the house we've got new

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,070
entrants coming in and we kind of know

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,690
that you know white labeling is not

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,040
going to be the end of that story

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,470
at least I contend and that's not gonna

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,960
be the end of the story and we know that

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,910
the requirements aren't going anywhere

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,380
so after 2022 there's gonna be a whole

00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,510
new set of regulations and there's gonna

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,160
be changes through regulations and Basel

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:07,260
4 and so forth and I proposed the

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,000
solution is that not only that firms

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,230
change their mentality about open source

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,360
and we're already seeing this of course

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,280
yeah the fact that we're all here we're

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,590
all talking about these matters shows

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,390
that we're changing our mentality but

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:25,370
also finance changes their mentality

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:28,460
about reg tech and starts to see it as

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:32,750
what Simon Wardley calls the utility

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:35,370
something that is necessary but not

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,010
differentiating it's something that we

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:42,690
must do but something that we don't get

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:45,540
competitive advantage from and the

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:49,290
Federal Open core model I propose is a

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,630
very good and very strong approach to

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,060
getting this done in such a way that it

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,530
could save huge amounts of money across

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,430
the industry but also huge amounts of

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,140
time and effort and everybody in the reg

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,240
tech world across all the four quadrants

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,250
that I've identified would benefit from

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,170
such an approach in various different

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:12,780
ways it's hard to see how anybody could

00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:19,500
you couldn't contest their benefits from

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:24,840
such an approach so that's my proposal

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:27,930
and that's my that's my proposed answer

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,580
to the questions that I've raised we've

00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,500
got a few minutes left and conscious

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,660
that we've had a couple of talks over

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,990
run but I'm happy to take any questions

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,850
if anybody wants to raise a question I'm

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,620
also more than happy to if you want to

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,900
grab me at some point this afternoon and

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,880
just ask any questions about my

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,070
judgments on these matters will tell me

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
any of your experience or maybe maybe

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,190
tell me that you think I'm onto

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,120
something please do grab me for out the

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,120
event I'll be wandering around

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:05,640
