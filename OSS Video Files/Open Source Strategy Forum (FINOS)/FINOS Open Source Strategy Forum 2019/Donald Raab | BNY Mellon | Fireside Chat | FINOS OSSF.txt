done Rob again a longtime friend of the

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,829
foundation BNY Mellon but you know from

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,559
an open source standpoint Project Lead

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,790
and committer for Eclipse collections

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,960
and the Java champion you know how many

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,869
of you are familiar with it but maybe

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,820
you want to give us a little bit more

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,799
what that is what that means okay

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:22,500
so Java champions so I was nominated and

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,030
selected as a Java champion around June

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:31,860
July of 2018 Java champions is basically

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,110
an exclusive group run by at Oracle it's

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,840
a select group of kind of industry

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,520
leaders Java user group leaders folks

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,340
that like you know a participated in

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,790
open source there's around I think 300

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,540
Java champions today in the world and

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:52,259
basically a smallish group kind of that

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,240
gets out helps advocate Java you know in

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,649
the community through different

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,420
initiatives you know whether it's like

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,909
participating once again user groups I'm

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,740
doing presentations helping you know get

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,079
a the Java community really built up

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,280
across across the world so it's quite I

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,549
guess an honor being a you know

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,190
nominated and selected it's a you know

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,870
some of it once again a distinct process

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,459
you can only become a Java champion by

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,540
being nominated by Java champion and

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,670
then you have to be voted in by the

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,290
other Java champion so it's a you know I

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,330
guess you're a meritocracy right I don't

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,099
have to take an exam I don't have to

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,690
pass a test I just have to work really

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,420
hard for 15 years and then someone

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,930
decided hey let's try and nominate Don

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,239
self

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,950
oh that sounds easy I just wanna say I

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,769
feel I feel much more at home with you

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,030
like where we've heard about C++ we've

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,090
heard about functional languages I'm

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,640
actually formerly Java guy definitely

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,500
not a Java champion was a developer they

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,970
they don't allow me to touch code for

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,700
the last 15 years but anyway that's

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,630
that's a different story let's let's

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,310
just get on with it so you you know you

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,310
were functional to the original

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:02,950
contribution of Eclipse collection when

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,420
was that again so I so I guess the great

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,099
Eclipse collections was at the end of

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,019
2015 but before was the club's

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,610
collections it was actually called GS

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,709
collections and it was the first project

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,810
open sourced at Goldman Sachs on the

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,549
Goldman Sachs github account in 2012

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,810
wasn't 12 yeah this now for seven years

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,430
you know one of the things I would say

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,840
like you need to be like working open

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,200
source be passionate patient and

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,790
persistent and make things happen so but

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,799
yeah prior to that was internally

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,769
developed at Goldman Sachs yeah and I

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,389
mean that's that's hone in on that one I

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,040
you know you said it was the sort of the

00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,239
first project that got open source

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
obviously we heard a big announcement

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,310
today but how you know what's your

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,720
advice how would you go about you know

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,130
getting a project open source within

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,280
within a service it's a great question

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,660
as a developer myself I got to you know

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,000
go through the experience I didn't have

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,430
someone to guide me along so I got to

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,040
meet a lot of people and you get to make

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,060
really good friends in legal and

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,639
compliance yep and these are your best

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,139
friends they're not there to prevent you

00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,019
from doing stuff they're there to

00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:15,979
protect you and the bank from you doing

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,790
bad that's a really interesting

00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:22,150
perspective and and was that that entail

00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,150
like

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,960
it's that rough introductory meeting and

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,300
then what you'll find is that folks you

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,919
know outside of technology while us

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,389
developers are really interested in

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,310
contributing to open source guess what

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,509
like you know folks in legal and

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,979
compliance are actually really

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,750
interested in participating in these

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,250
initiatives as well right yeah

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,289
really interesting work right it's like

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,630
you know having to get them to exercise

00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:50,120
you know things in a different space and

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,349
I think you know any lawyers in the

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,460
audience yep

00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:57,319
we liked working an open source mostly

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,229
the same hands I'll talk to the ones

00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,069
that don't like it well now I think I

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,810
think it's a really interesting

00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:06,289
perspective because since we started

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,270
thinnest you know we we heard many times

00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,069
developers sort of complaining if you

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,870
want about sort of compliance and legal

00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,630
but I think you bring a very interesting

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,159
perspective you know they have really

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,440
important role and so it's important to

00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,120
get them along and I think that's really

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,270
well you know the early date of fairness

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,060
have been focused on but let's let's

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,979
kind of switch over to you know the

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,870
community side once once you're over the

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:34,310
hub of contribution you spoke you know

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,380
you're an early friend of the foundation

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,509
you spoke at the first edition of open

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,310
so strategy forum two years ago because

00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,729
talk was they can't hear you on mute

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,889
yeah it's an amazing title by the way

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:53,210
and if you go go Babbitt to the first

00:05:45,889 --> 00:06:00,680
help so yeah no all right I'm all

00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:01,819
opinions I express or my own you know

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,740
that's how you make friends

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:08,539
your lawyers so in that presentation you

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,240
said something along the lines so you

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,009
know code plus Internet doesn't equal

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,380
success it doesn't mean just you know

00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:16,969
throwing it over the hump and so you

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,569
know what are the sort of one or two

00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:22,849
pieces of advice that you give a

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,380
potential contributor you know when they

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,419
actually open source a piece of code

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,919
yeah so it may seem really hard you know

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,300
getting that source code out the door

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,969
and you and you finally achieve that

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,830
your journey has just begun right and

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,839
the talk I gave of the they can't have

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,550
you knew the open source strategy form

00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,010
two years ago talked about you know

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,339
that's step one then there's step two

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,930
and then there's success right and you

00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:48,169
know the initial you step up the door

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,969
what you realize is that open source

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:51,680
isn't just about contributing code right

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,210
it's about participating in communities

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,949
right and you need to get out there and

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,509
talk to people and communicate with

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,949
folks right so now you're gonna have to

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,889
actually exercise things they're not

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,659
just committing and to get right you

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,849
might need to sit on the stage here yep

00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:07,639
and talk with gab or you might need to

00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,300
actually tweet everybody tweet yeah

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,779
please

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,960
nobody tweets right just me I got my

00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:16,909
Twitter handle and it's funny because

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,969
you know in the early days I didn't

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,440
tweet right and you realize that it's

00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:23,060
actually important to get out and engage

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,680
the community but I think you know

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,000
getting back the three things I would

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,529
think you know you need to really do is

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,759
like you need to have clear goals what

00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:31,130
are you trying to accomplish by the open

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,110
sourcing establish that what do you want

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,219
to try and achieve right is it just

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,690
getting the source code on the internet

00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,940
or is there something you want to impact

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,639
if I look at like the Eclipse collection

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,990
is open sourcing you know when it was GS

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,820
collections the thing I was trying to

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,529
help achieve was to get lambda since you

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,690
know ultimately streams into the Java

00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,310
language so I worked on the jsr 335

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,860
expert group and I was working alongside

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,719
industry experts who are very well known

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,009
in the space and basic lamb and they're

00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:57,620
you know as a you know at the time

00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,669
Goldman Sachs employee like nobody knew

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,589
who I was and that I have any

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,849
credibility whatsoever so actually open

00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:04,009
sourcing and sharing the code was the

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,649
way for us to actually impact that

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,719
expert group so that we could get well

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,520
informed in terms of how lambdas and

00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:11,750
streams will best operate in the java

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,089
language so I can look back and say hey

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,099
we were successful at that we OPI soar

00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:18,529
I'm sorry released Java 8 in March of

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,930
2014 and actually helped contribute into

00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:23,360
the space of the specifications for that

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,279
right but then it's like then what are

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,409
my goals right it was like well I want

00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,089
people to adopt this framework that's

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,390
now sitting out there right and I had to

00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:35,089
learn different things I had to develop

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,589
a marketing strategy and that's

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,449
important how are you gonna market this

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,650
thing that you put out there what about

00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:42,949
what are the medium is you're going to

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,000
talk on you know proof to do that and

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,070
what kind of approval so you're going to

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,110
need to do that and

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,700
as you're marketing that's not enough

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,370
you need to be able to measure things

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,180
right a former mentor of mine uses

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,690
something like you need to measure

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,130
execute and repeat right so once you're

00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,810
actually out there marketing you need to

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,460
understand what you can actually measure

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,800
in terms of the impact that you're

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,630
having maybe it stars on github maybe

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,250
it's downloads from maven central maybe

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,470
it's like your followers on Twitter

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,270
maybe it's like you know the number of

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,140
followers you have been you know medium

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:16,910
or LinkedIn yada yada yada in terms of

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,290
the the different mediums and I think

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,390
you know in the in the slide that could

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,700
you go look at it there were one of the

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,040
key things I talk about is how do you

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,230
get your engineers to commit to the

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,730
project and not just your there's your

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,320
own engineers there's also engineers in

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,020
the community I think it's very

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,670
important for us you know financial

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,650
services and other large you know

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,810
corporations to make it clear to

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,790
developers what they can do

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,220
having a clear social media strategy

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,930
that covers multiple channels is very

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,520
important because one of the things you

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,620
have to fear as like well what can I do

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,630
right if you have a social media policy

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,130
that starts to tell you that maybe

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,170
you've got some of the answers right

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,820
then you need to encourage your

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,440
developers to actually participate in

00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,670
social communities like hey we're

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,110
putting a source go out there but we're

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,550
actually encouraging you the UH

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,990
participate in the open source like

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,910
participate and let's say the fin OS

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,230
workgroups yep or other you know

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,270
foundation things are you just in the

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,390
project itself so encouraging developers

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,070
to participates important allowing you

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,040
developers time to actually participate

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,400
yep it's important right and then

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,480
finally like recognizing your developers

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,880
positively for the contributions they're

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,620
actually making to the space right and I

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,270
call this like you need to hear your

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,470
developers right you need to have a

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,670
social media policy you need to

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,350
encourage them you need to actually

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,290
allow them to do things they need to

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:37,250
actually recognize them once they do it

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:39,410
that's that's amazing and it really

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,560
resonates with several of the challenges

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:46,010
that you know we help both individuals

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,950
and companies to really sort of bridge

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,170
this gap it's it's I think in my

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,030
personal you know from my perspective

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,960
it's a sort of an iterative process

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,190
where you know with more contributions

00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,980
strategic contributions like we're you

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,370
know we announced

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,430
a big one from from Goldman that really

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,199
sort of helps bridging this gap in you

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,730
know recognizing you know making sort of

00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,639
the business value clear to Jurgen

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,779
addition so that they will then you know

00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,820
encourage to your point and here the

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,010
developers and given them time to

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,110
actually work on it they it it's you

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,430
know things have just evolved so quickly

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,649
when in the last two or three years kind

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,600
of switching to foundations I mean we

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:33,149
talked about you know obviously a little

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:35,910
bit selfishly here but so you first open

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:38,279
source GES collections as a sort of open

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,660
source project out there in github and

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:45,089
then a couple of years later I think it

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:48,180
was 2004 2015 15 was contributed to the

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,579
Eclipse Foundation I mean you know

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,790
hopefully by now since everyone knows

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:58,190
Venus but what would you say sort of the

00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:01,230
value or the sort of biggest values for

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,959
you know did you have by what you wanted

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,459
to achieve by contributing to an actual

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,930
foundation what's what's the difference

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,750
there why not just leaving it on github

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,310
so when we move to the Eclipse

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,810
Foundation once again getting back to

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,339
having goals there was a goal for us to

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,839
achieve there which is we wanted to

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,120
actually open up the source code to the

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,709
entire community to contribute to do us

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,079
collections when it was open sourced it

00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:23,550
was free as in beer you could go fork it

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,540
on github you could download it out and

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,579
they've been central but you couldn't

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,930
contribute back to it and we wanted to

00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,279
solve that problem how do we get

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,560
developers to actually contribute back

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,760
so we move the framework to the Eclipse

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,220
Foundation and became Eclipse

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,079
collections and then any contributor

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,310
goes through the process of the Eclipse

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,959
Foundation you sign the Eclipse

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,430
contributor agreement right yep

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,769
basically you've got a well established

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,350
foundation I think the key thing for us

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,300
was like we learned so much meant you

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,220
know being mentored by members of the

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,019
Eclipse Foundation in terms of how to

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,240
actually manage an open source project

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,769
and deal with like you know now we need

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,810
to have you know mixed you know

00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,699
intellectual property and how does that

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,769
work right and you know how do you deal

00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:03,449
with copyrights and all of these things

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,399
so there was a tremendous amount that we

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,160
learned by participating in a foundation

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,779
it's like we didn't have to you know

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,939
kind of go on our own to learn that

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,050
right and I think that helped you know I

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:15,540
would say inform

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,830
you know later initiatives in terms of

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,080
how do we want to think about an

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,160
approach thing so foundations are great

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,990
because you guys have a ton of

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,760
experience in terms of open sourcing

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,640
projects right you come with like the

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,340
whole governance structure and it I

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,900
think also then makes folks in the

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,460
community more comfortable to like you

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,590
know hey I'm contributing to a

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,480
foundation where the project is managed

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,270
and yeah that project not to a specific

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,030
vendor or you know company so there's

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,340
some amount of comfort there so that's

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:49,050
that's fascinating and I think actually

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:51,450
from our perspective you know I I've

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,760
seen a spectrum of foundations having

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,950
sort of more high touch versus low touch

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,300
you know maybe an Apache foundation is a

00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,800
little bit more loaded she have the

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,170
Linux Foundation being a little bit more

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,720
high touch from our perspective there

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,330
was a lot of you know enablement and

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,660
nurturing and teaching also an

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,650
additional level in addition to sort of

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:17,510
individual contributors but it's it's I

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:20,760
remember quote from was a CTO from one

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,410
pretty pretty large buy-side firm who

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,140
told me look we're looking what you guys

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,300
doing you know I've tried to do that so

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,640
many times but I've always failed on

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,580
governance like governance is hard so

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,960
actually even just you know inheriting

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,750
the governance from a foundation is

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,430
really it's really potentially variable

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,790
so moving forward we talked about

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:44,730
foundations you know I wanna I'm a big

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,550
fan of you know communities are made of

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,520
individuals communities again as I said

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:54,570
in my opening keynote it's ultimately

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,670
the benefit of the individual that also

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,220
is a huge part of why people contribute

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,170
I mean what would you say is for you

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,960
like for your career in your experience

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,600
what's what's the biggest benefit that

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,800
you think an individual will get out of

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,450
open source contributions of

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,590
participating in open source communities

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,060
so the first thing I'm gonna say is your

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,300
mileage may vary I can talk about my

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,600
other but you know for me and I just

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,880
tweeted about this this week the open

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,600
sourcing of

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,889
you know eclipses collections was

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,260
interesting and Neil did a whole bunch

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:30,889
of unexpected and unpredicted you know

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,079
benefits so you know and once again 2014

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:36,829
I just created my you know Twitter

00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,959
account and and it probably didn't tweet

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:41,930
for like several years right and it's

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,779
interesting in that after years of going

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,579
out to conferences and presenting people

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,260
start to recognize you right you

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,420
actually start to build your personal

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,480
brand right it's like hey that's

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:57,860
happened on Rob you know he's you know

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,930
doing this than the other but you know

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,180
and over time and you know what's

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,699
interesting is when you get out there

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,320
and I guess have the interesting story

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,760
of like you know I've been consistently

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
out there every year I've presented it

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,870
let's say Java WOM and now code one for

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,120
the last six years as well as other

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,399
conferences I go to Java user group

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,149
meetups right and it's just for me I'm

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,529
so inspired and motivated by developers

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:24,100
that I get to meet and talk to

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:27,110
individually right and you know

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,279
literally somebody you know once

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,589
described of me

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,130
I have infectious enthusiasm to be

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:37,279
careful can spread this around and good

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,350
things will happen so but you know

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,959
getting out and once again getting folks

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,510
you know involved as you know

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,069
tremendously motivating one of the great

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,160
things once again though for me it's

00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:50,389
like seeing your code actually

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,519
downloaded and used now I can't see

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,110
where it's used but I can go to maven

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,970
central and see like last month there

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,339
were 70,000 downloads of eclipse

00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,870
collections and maybe that's used by

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,310
hundreds of thousand developers I don't

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,610
know because I can't really see who's

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,900
downloading it and maybe like some firm

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,520
you know as ten thousand developers that

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,020
are downloading at once I have no idea

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,610
but seventy thousand feels like hey

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,949
that's actually a pretty decent number

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,870
and it keeps growing over time so you

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,130
see that consistent trend and I think

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,679
the key thing for I don't know other

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,569
developers but for myself having your

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,790
code actually execute and production is

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,020
like hugely you know motivating right

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,240
it's like I don't want to write code

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,829
just because I want to look at it read

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,330
at it and feel impressed you know with

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,950
the code that I want to see once again

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,580
it's actually running and solving

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,960
problems and getting incorporated in

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,330
I hadn't expected this but you know it

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,790
tips collections is included in some you

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,560
know other open-source libraries so it's

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,570
actually you know dependency and neo4j

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,950
it's a dependency income unda it's you

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,530
know yeah dependency and deep learning

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,940
for Java and it's like I I'm not working

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,530
with the developers that are actually

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,780
taking the gathered incorporating it but

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,490
that's out there happening right yeah so

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,280
that's hugely motivating and I think

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,750
ultimately in a last year when I was in

00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,950
a nominated and select as a Java

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,770
champion that was not something I

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,170
expected at all right you know I was out

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,840
there just once again doing what I do

00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,340
sharing like passion and enthusiasm yeah

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,650
and this was kind of like along the way

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,150
like hey this guy's really active in the

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,980
java community and got you know got the

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,660
recognition you know of Java champion

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,490
along with it which is amazing and it's

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,680
funny because like on that front and

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,880
it's like just a whole nother world is

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,920
opened up to me like there's this

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,560
network of Java champions that I like to

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,360
get to you know interact with like at

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,980
any point whether it's like on Twitter

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,960
or it's some conference we'll meet up

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,700
have conversations and like the

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,650
networking benefit has been tremendous

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,680
right so and you start to feel like

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,090
you've got this like large family yeah

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,140
like community at some stage yeah the

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,530
people that you're working with and

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,780
talking with all the time so well all

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,280
right no absolutely I mean I couldn't

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,050
agree more

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,660
you know developers don't have a name to

00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:56,230
be them the most social people ever but

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:59,830
turns out developers have a heart now

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,170
the kidding aside I really do you know

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,450
maybe I'm I ever play my emotions as an

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,380
Italian but I had really happened I can

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:10,660
read away one day only ways but I can

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,060
really relate to this idea of like

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,470
people that you don't know are you know

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,840
the building on the achievements they

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,760
you you created you put so much work and

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,170
sweat it--with in so yeah that's it is

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,670
the hugest compliment when someone just

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,110
reached out reaches out to you out of

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,060
the blue and contacts you and says I've

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,500
been doing X and they're like you're

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,120
like you've been doing what like and

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,650
they've been doing all this work let's

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,570
say involved with like something you

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,250
created it's a and I found it is

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,380
tremendously flattering and a compliment

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,910
so and that wouldn't happen otherwise

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,340
right if I was just you know developing

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:43,360
at my desk inside the bank that I work

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:46,480
in yep never seen the outside I I

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,180
couldn't agree more done so look

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,460
wrapping up last question you know we

00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,190
talk about individual let's just you

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,680
know talk about organizations I mean

00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,160
what what do you think I mean there's

00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,110
obviously you know I've heard several

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,200
times you know by allowing your

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,120
developers to be out there you know they

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,430
open yourself to the risk of poaching

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,500
for example but like what what do you

00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,760
think is the benefit for an organization

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,220
to actually be a leader in open-source

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,750
it's a good question so I would say in a

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,750
lot of ways and this is something I

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,490
talked about you know with you know

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,560
different folks we're all on a war for

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,090
talent right and there's a limited

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,590
amount of talent in the world and what I

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,650
would tell you is like the war for

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,150
talent is over the talent is actually

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,470
out there contributing to open source so

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,940
what you need to do is not compete for

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,070
talent you need to collaborate for it

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,540
right so getting out there and actually

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,130
realizing that like you're not going to

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,110
be able to hire every great developer in

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,610
the world yeah right but there are lots

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,960
of great developers that actually can

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,440
come together and work together on

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,790
problems right so by contributing and

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,140
participating in open source as well

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,820
like you lower your risk as an

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,920
organization right one of the things

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,320
I've often heard from developers inside

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,140
of the firms I work with you know work

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,090
in that developers do not want to adopt

00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,530
a tool or framework that's only

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,910
developed inside of the bank because

00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,000
they feel like they're going to be at

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,220
risk of organizational shifts right

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,020
we're basically the folks that relying

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,330
on our lower longer focus on that

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,790
product and now they own it and it may

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,860
not be in a you know state where they

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,170
can actually take ownership of it right

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,400
yes you do offload some of your risk by

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,020
making sure that you've gone through the

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,960
process of making sure that anybody can

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,630
contribute to it yep and you know let's

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,830
say one day I'm not the project lead you

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,450
know I'll probably always retain

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,410
committer access unless they I don't do

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,000
anything on it yep

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,010
like I'm not the project lead for Clips

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,330
collections anymore someone else is

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,340
right but it's running at a foundation

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,440
right so the risk of anybody being

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,690
dependent on me Donald Robb the you know

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,250
project lead and creator of it is like

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,470
is lowered right there's a whole

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,480
community of contributors that you know

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,370
can actually step up and take over the

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,160
work that has been done right so you

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,040
lower that risk once again of

00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,270
obsolescence of

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,250
that you're developing internally

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,630
there's no guarantee anywhere yeah but

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,150
it's more likely that you could actually

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,520
continue the life outside so that was so

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,550
so surprising to me I mean when I first

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,560
came into the industry and and you know

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,450
I've seen a much higher degree of

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,850
competition internal competition between

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,930
even developers then I've seen in any

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,550
sort of tech company paired with instead

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,290
saying yeah but you know I'm not gonna

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,960
give the code to my you know the guy who

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,610
works at the next desk but I want the

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,770
code that I depend on to be open-source

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,650
to be you know you cannot trust more the

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,480
open-source community then yeah just

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,790
wrapped it is mind blowing this yeah it

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,890
cost me like I don't know confusion for

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,000
many years where yeah you would trust

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,200
the developer you don't know on the

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,330
internet more than you trust the person

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,860
who sits right next to you and it's a

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,630
once again it's not it's not really like

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,880
a personal thing right it's yes again I

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,290
would say after years about thinking

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,030
about it and looking at it I think it's

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,490
that organizational thing right where

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,620
once again organizations you know change

00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,990
and reshape and people move around right

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,000
so and when you use something you want

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,290
to know that either in the olden days

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,240
you say I want to know who the vendor is

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,340
so I can you know make sure that my

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,630
stuff has always supported and now like
