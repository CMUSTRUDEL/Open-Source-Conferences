so good to be here thank you so much

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,479
uh so we're going to be just having a

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
fireside chat today

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
about a number of different issues in um

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,920
open source

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,079
uh communities and and volunteers and

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
community communities

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,119
and one of the things that we were

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,479
talking about earlier was um

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,280
that you recently were able to host a

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
connecting volunteerism to business

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,239
goals

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,840
panel last week and there was a lot of

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
great takeaways from that particular

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
event

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
that you shared on linkedin and one of

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
the points that really connected with me

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
was this point that it's really

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,640
important to strengthen

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,480
uh employee and community relationships

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,599
in business um so that businesses can

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,440
reach their goals so

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,000
applying that to to the world of open

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,920
source like why is that so important

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
i think that's a great great question so

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,120
last week i

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
attended the u.s chamber of commerce

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,920
solved together corporate citizenship

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,000
conference

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,840
and largely our goal was to talk about

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
how we can bring

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
employee engagement as well as

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
volunteerism to solve some of the issues

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
that companies are having

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,840
web revenue goals growth things of that

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,599
nature and what we really found is that

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
in the past people have looked at

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
volunteerism

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,560
as something that's a nice to do a nice

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
to have

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,159
not really something that's aligned with

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
a corporate goal definitely not

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
something that's been aligned with

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
generating revenue

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,200
but now we're seeing that there are

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,959
opportunities to through volunteerism

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,319
build your brand whether it's your

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,360
personal brand or whether it's your

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
corporate brand

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
and also there's opportunity to engage

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
clients i know that jerry and i were

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
talking earlier about

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
open source in general and just the

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
volunteer aspect and i really don't look

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
at it as

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
volunteering but that's what it is a

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
volunteer aspect that goes into open

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
source

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
and so really understanding when we do

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
have these volunteer

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,319
efforts how are we presenting ourselves

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,640
how are we representing our corporations

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,319
and so we really found that to be the

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,879
link volunteerism

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,799
is a great way to really first of all to

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,400
demonstrate your own personal brand

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,840
as well as your corporate brand and

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
really leveraging that to

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,920
um support your your firm as well as

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
your customers

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
and i think that's very true in the open

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
source world is

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,360
as well we see a lot of developers who

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,360
are really getting into

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
open source not just because you know

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
it's an interesting problem to solve but

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
it's

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,280
you know it's about sort of building

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,680
that that developer brand so they become

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,040
more you know valuable potentially as a

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
hiree or something

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
you know of that sort but they want to

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,160
see you know that kind of participation

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,000
um you know from their their

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
employers as well they want to see that

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
connection there too

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,040
yeah and on that point building the

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,040
developer brand one of the things that

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
i found just in my work i'm jory

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
mentioned some of the folks i've

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
interviewed through

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
the shows in the podcast is that many

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
times we

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
are unaware of the effect that we have

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,199
in every interaction

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
i know that working with open source

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
there are a lot of virtual interaction

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
so things are a bit different

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,360
in that respect but every time we

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
interact with um a colleague or with a

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
customer

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
or with someone else who is in our

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,120
community

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,040
what sort of impact are we having what

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
is our intention behind that

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
and i don't want to sound too you know

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
as they call it but

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
really going into these situations um

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
going into these communities

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
understanding what we want our intention

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,199
to be understanding what the

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
organization's

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,199
intention is and ensuring that we are

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,880
aligned with that intention

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
i think is a really good first step so

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
when it comes to thinking about

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
how we brand ourselves really

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
understanding first of all what's my

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,960
intention here

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,639
what's my organization's intention is my

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
intention and the organization's

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
attention

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
are they aligned um if not maybe it's

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,120
time to rethink

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,520
those intentions but if so that's a

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,240
really really good starting place

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
to build your brand so i really like

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
that you're talking about that

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
intentionality

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
piece because you know i think a lot of

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,600
people get into open source

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,560
um as sort of like i have i do have good

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
intentions i

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,479
intend to do good with this project but

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
then

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,880
or they intend to improve the project in

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,840
some way shape or form

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
but thinking about it that pointedly and

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,360
that

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
strategically seems to very rarely

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
happen it's

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
not something that we kind of put front

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
and center what are some things we can

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
do

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
or would you recommend that we do as

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,199
developers as

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,680
as executives here to to make

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
intentionality a forefront goal

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
sure so first of all just simply setting

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
it um just simply understanding you know

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,639
this is what i'm

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
in this business to do this is what i'm

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
in this organization or this community

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,919
to do so setting that intention

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
is first and foremost and then the

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
second and maybe

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,639
the one of the most important really

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,039
listen and

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
i was explaining earlier in my career i

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,800
as a marketer

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
i worked a lot with our developer

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
community one of my colleagues from the

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
developer community is here

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
um when i was with thompson reuters um

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
now our friend of the developer

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
community

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
i knew very little about developers now

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
i don't claim to know a lot

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,319
right now but i knew very little about

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
developers even less about coding

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,759
um and i had a wonderful mentor at the

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
time who said

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
you know we're talking about building

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
out these apis clearly you don't know

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,840
what an api is clearly you don't know

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
what it does

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,000
how about you go and learn some code and

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
i went and taught myself

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
a bit of python and then began attending

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,160
meetups

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319
and i really listened to people who were

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,800
experts in the area it was great because

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
i came from a place where i had no basic

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
knowledge

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,000
so i didn't have to unlearn but the

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,520
importance and the value of listening i

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
know all of you know that area quite

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
well but there may be areas that

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,599
we don't know about so the value of

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,479
listening and really giving that time to

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
the other person

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
um is critical so i've given you two the

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
intention the listening

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
and then finally really focusing on

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,240
building together

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
so where there's a bridge crossing that

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
bridge and building together

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,280
we talk a lot on the podcast and just in

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,120
general

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
some of the work that i do with some of

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,199
our employee resource groups

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,280
we talk a lot about relationship

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,160
building and where does it start

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,879
and again when you have a direct contact

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
with people

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
in person that's that that's one model

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
but

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,360
in many times not just developers no

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
matter what

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
industry you're in a lot of times our

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
interactions now are primarily virtual

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,240
and so it's really important

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,680
for me to understand the language that i

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,160
use so if i'm sending

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
an email or a slack message or even you

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
know tweeting

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
what type of language am i using and if

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,440
i start from that place of intention

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,680
first and then if i really listen and

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,919
understand the goals of the other person

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
and how i can meet them halfway more

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,080
than likely the language that i use will

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,560
be

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
respectful the language that i use will

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,839
help to bridge

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,599
gaps and it will help to bring us

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,479
together so we'll be a little closer to

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
our goals

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
so in terms of three things that are

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
really important obviously there are

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
loads of others

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,959
i would say intention first listing

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,120
second and really focusing on

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,800
building relationships that can be done

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
virtually just like it can be done

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
um person to person i love those those

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
points because you know

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
you talk about you know listening that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
helps people to remember you know let's

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,399
seek first to understand and then be

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
understood and then

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,800
um you know building with people not

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
around them or through them or in spite

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,360
of them but with them is really really

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,000
important

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,120
um we also were kind of talking about

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
this idea of

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
responsible business leadership in this

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
space which is

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,160
something that i think um the open

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,760
source world would love to

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,440
to see more of um you know

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
what can we what can what does that look

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,560
like what does responsible business

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,080
leadership look like in volunteer

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
communities well you know we're hearing

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
a lot

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,880
about how many of us in here have heard

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
responsible business or social impact

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,240
use a lot over the last like

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,920
a year okay yeah we're hearing a lot

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
about that i know that earlier this

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,519
summer there was um

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
the business roundtable which is a group

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,959
of ceos of

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,760
large corporations they meet annually

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,000
and this year jamie dimon the ceo of jp

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,200
morgan and other ceo of johnson johnson

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
2 actually came out

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
and said that the way we've been doing

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
business in the past

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
that's not the way we need to do

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,079
business moving forward

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,160
and the reason it was so shocking for

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,440
some communities is because it directly

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
contradicts

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,320
some some of the ways that we've been

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,399
managing and doing business in the past

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
if you look at the 1970s there was an

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,279
american economist by the name of milton

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
friedman

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,160
and he wrote in the new york times and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,560
said the purpose of business

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,240
is to generate revenue for for

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,920
shareholders so the purpose of being in

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
business is to delight shareholders and

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
i'm paraphrasing there

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,560
but in that time at that particular time

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
that

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,120
was the model and i can't say that we

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
strayed too far from that over the past

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
several years after that but that was

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
definitely the model

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,360
it was something that was spoken by a

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,200
thought leader someone who

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
you know knew industry well an american

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,519
economist um

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
and it was validated coming from that

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,560
space

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
and so now what we're seeing is a type

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,480
of validation

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
coming from a similar space but clearly

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
it's a different

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,240
type of content a different validation

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,399
and so it's really important because

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,399
we see people in mainstream now

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,480
mainstream industries

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,480
who are really talking about the purpose

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
of compassionate business the purpose of

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
social impact

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,720
and what we're seeing and i have to say

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
too that it's

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,279
really coming together along with our

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,360
conversations about sustainability so

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,720
if you look at this from from a

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
trajectory perspective

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
we're talking about the environment and

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
how we can create a better environment

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
and do right by the environment

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
at the same time we're talking about

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
people in humans right and how we can do

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
better by each other

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,320
and if we look at that how that's really

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
emerging and converging together it's so

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,839
exciting for me

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959
because we're taking the two most

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
important elements you know the

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,680
environment and people and saying hey we

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,240
can really do

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,200
a better job with how we engage with how

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
we treat

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
um with how we build relationships

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,000
around these things

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,279
so in terms of social impact a lot of

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,560
that has to do with

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,839
how we as corporations as organizations

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
as communities

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
what impact do we want to have on those

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
communities that we live in

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
and that we do business in and that

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
impact can consist of

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
reducing our carbon footprint we've

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
talked a lot about that you've probably

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,079
seen that in the media

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
it also can do a lot with volunteer

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
efforts

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
right so how can we go out into the

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,639
community and teach a little about

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,079
coding for example

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,920
how can we go out in the community and

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,680
teach a little about financial education

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,839
for those of us who are in that industry

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,519
so it's really i can't tell you how

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,920
excited i am that these

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,920
two areas are converging because i think

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
that a lot of us have a lot of good

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,839
intentionality behind that

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,200
but we really have the space now and we

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
have the platforms

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
that we need to really make sure that we

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,399
make progress in those areas

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
and another thing i know that we talked

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,519
about too is um you know a lot of what

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
we're discussing with

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,800
the environment with social impact is

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
behavior

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
right and one of the things jory and i

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,320
talked about is

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,000
can you legislate good behavior right

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
can you force people to do things first

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
of all what is good behavior because you

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,320
and i may not agree on what it is

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,959
and can you really somehow

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
influence people to behave in a certain

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,760
way

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
and the answer is i think we've tried to

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
do that i think we've all seen the

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,240
results of trying to legislate

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,480
in various ways um but really building

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,320
relationships so that intention

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,639
and that listening and the relationship

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,880
building i feel that that is the best

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,279
way to really understand first of all

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,720
what does good positive behavior what

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,880
does that look like

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
and then to influence others toward that

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,360
good positive behavior

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,120
i mean i know you were talking about

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
standards earlier and the standard set

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,199
by open source

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
communities we talked about in that

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,440
context yeah so you know

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,279
i was thinking about sort of that

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,240
responsible business component and one

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,440
of the things

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,040
that really was coming to mind is this

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
certainly there's been a lot of movement

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
within the open source world

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,399
and open standards world to make sure

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,639
that we have really solid

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,760
professional codes of conduct that help

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
sort of

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
bolster communities and make those

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,240
communities safe spaces to do

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
uh work and and to volunteer both for um

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
community contributors and also

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,720
corporate contributors and participants

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,519
right that benefits everybody

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
um but you know we also see kind of a

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
gap in

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
skills and abilities sometimes because

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,959
those are self you know moderating

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
groups and self

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,680
um self managing uh communities but

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,199
our enterprise partners uh folks who are

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,440
working in corporate open source they

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,920
have lots of support and policies um

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,519
that

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,720
that help people um behave correctly or

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
behave professionally in some of these

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,639
contexts so i certainly think that

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,480
there's

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,760
there's probably some lovely things that

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,000
that our corporate partners in open

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,160
source can do for these communities

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,279
um and that that was just one of one of

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,920
the ones that i thought of

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,120
um i'm curious to see you know if there

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,040
are other

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
things along the that those that line

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
that that we could

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,079
we could collaborate on across open

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,800
source and and um

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,920
corporate kind of partnerships sure

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
absolutely and

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,839
standards are are needed right we need

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
to have these basic standards that

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
everyone

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
can agree to and that's what makes a

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,360
society a society right basically having

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
these types of standards that we all

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,240
agree to so

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,680
that is definitely necessary so the

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,639
standards that we have in these

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,720
open source communities is is needed but

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
beyond that in terms of how do we ensure

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,440
that people

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,199
people are operating in a good way

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
people are happy to operate within the

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
frameworks

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,519
that we've designed that's i think where

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,360
those other elements come in where we

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,360
really can listen to folks we really can

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,320
make sure that we're building standards

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,880
around an intention that we all agree to

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,399
um to a certain extent that we listen to

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
people and understand which standards

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,720
are working and which standards we need

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
to tweak

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,839
so when you create these standards in

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,839
the open source community we don't

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
create them to have them indefinitely

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,519
this is just something to

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,600
lay groundwork to create a framework

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
when do we need to adapt when do we need

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
to

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,759
tweak those um and then finally what is

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
the purpose of the standards

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,759
are the standards there to help build

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,440
relationships so if we're talking about

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,920
how we're communicating with each other

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
on on these open source communities

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,759
how can we ensure that we are

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,240
communicating in such a way that we are

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
furthering our our goals and building

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
relationships i think that the standards

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
that

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,360
are in place to do that will do well

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
that's right i think we really need that

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
sort of um iterative

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,320
because that's the open source way too

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
right like we shouldn't just

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
you know create a policy and say this is

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
it never changing it's got to be

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
something that um is an open dialogue

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
between

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,360
stakeholders and participants in the

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,440
community to sort of constantly improve

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
constantly evaluate and respond to and

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,839
that kind of that kind of thing so we're

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,199
making uh making changes for the for the

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,240
better for everybody

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,000
um yeah so one of the things we

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,920
were talking about was in the standard

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,959
space specifically you know we've got

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,839
uh if you look at a technical standard

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,360
like um

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
ecmascript which is the committee that i

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
work on 60 plus people

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,800
regularly attend those standards

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,160
meetings and those are representatives

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,079
from the community and also

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,280
representatives from big business

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,360
partners

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
and some of them in financial services

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,439
so you know

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,400
how do we create these spaces where

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
those folks can

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,880
get together and productively have

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,079
conversations about the future of our

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,319
technologies

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,319
and 60 people you know sometimes getting

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
two people in one room and to agree on

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
something is a bit of a challenge so

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
60 people with the purpose of really

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,679
building out these

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,039
good impactful standards that first of

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,960
all it should be acknowledged that

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,160
you know to come together in that way is

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,559
very is

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,760
quite a behemoth of a thing to do so

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,840
with that being said

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,000
bringing this group together or this

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,640
huge bmw and saying we want to create

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
standards

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,919
we do have to understand that you know

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,320
we come from different

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,600
backgrounds we have different mindsets

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,880
we have things that are

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,720
important to us that may not be

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,320
important to someone else so you know

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,480
being respectful in that way and i've

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,360
used that earlier but really respecting

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,120
the fact that i understand that i have a

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,960
perspective but i know that your

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,160
perspective is just as important to you

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
as it is to me

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
and that's something that again is

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,080
challenging to legislate that

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,240
but if we all can just in a group of

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,559
that nature be aware of that and say

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
okay how can we ensure that all of us

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
treat

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,520
the opinions and the perspectives of

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,520
each other equally and that we can talk

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,600
about those things in a way that

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,679
is respectful in a way that really gets

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
results so bringing that number of

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,400
people

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,919
together in one place challenging but

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,360
the way i feel that we can definitely

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,039
drive it forward and this is something

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,919
that i've heard lots of people say on on

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,160
my show

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,400
is that we can do that once we are

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,400
respectful listen to the other person

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,000
um and really understand what the end

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,679
goal is and the best way to get there

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,600
together is to listen and build

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,679
relationship to get to be in gold

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
and and i think also working together on

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,120
on the process there

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,360
as well and respecting that process

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
because certainly it takes two to tango

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,039
and if you're not

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,400
both doing the same dance then it's easy

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,440
for folks to sort of undermine that

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,039
process isn't it

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,799
and jerry the framework too i mean you

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,320
mentioned the process if we if we can

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
all agree and be excited about the

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
framework then

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
we're pretty much off to a good start

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,240
but if we're starting from a place

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,559
of a lack of clarity if we're starting

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,840
from a place of lack of enthusiasm and i

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,240
know people are saying probably

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,039
enthusiasm at work in the open source

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,120
community okay

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,400
maybe i got the wrong session here but

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,640
enthusiasm that's what

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
i meant so how can we get excited about

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
the work that we're doing

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,400
even if we're creating standards even if

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,080
we're carrying out rules

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
what can make us excited and i think

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,200
that that is the

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,640
something that the administrators can do

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,120
something that the managers can do

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640
to really understand what excites a

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
group and then bringing the group

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
together and highlighting that

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
particular

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,039
area one thing that i think really

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,840
stands out and what could really drive

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,039
enthusiasm is simple appreciation and

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
that's something that we can do no

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,559
matter what environment

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
we're in but with these standard

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,960
builders

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
we can really show how we appreciate

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
that they are volunteering their time in

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,360
many cases

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,440
and that they're giving their

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,760
intelligence for the greater good

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
of this community so appreciation is one

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,880
way to do that

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
i think that's a great idea and because

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
you know a lot of times this is really

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,280
hard work

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,360
it's it's hard technical work sometimes

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
it's hard emotional work to to produce

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,000
open source or or

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,919
an open standard and sometimes um

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,320
organizations and highly regulated

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,000
industries don't get the opportunity to

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
do that work in the open

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,360
like they might like to so they they

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,159
could as a

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
matter of contributing and showing their

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,320
desire to participate say

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
you know here's a little you know gift

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
or thank you or

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,200
something you know um and that would go

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
i think i think that would be well

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,679
received

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
great idea doesn't have to be expensive

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
you know it doesn't have to be you know

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,600
here's a

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
thousand dollar amex car for all ten

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
thousand people it doesn't have to be

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,039
that but

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,720
merely in studies have shown if you

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,720
simply tell your team

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,200
you know we really appreciate you right

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,919
you give so much to this firm

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
your contributions are recognized if you

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,480
take someone look them in the eye and

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
say that

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,960
that does a lot more sometimes than

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,440
money there are some studies a cnbc

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
article actually that said that bonuses

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,360
do well in terms of motivating folks but

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,640
really showing appreciation by telling

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,039
them that

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,159
does a phenomenal job in doing that and

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,679
one of the things too that we talked

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,320
about in terms of appreciation was

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,559
really

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,600
how can businesses show their

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
appreciation for

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
open source communities so you know

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,720
we're doing this work the business may

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,080
have some developers that

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,760
come on to our community this open

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,760
source community we give our

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,480
intelligence we give this information we

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,559
share

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,080
um but we don't seem to really get a lot

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,760
back from the communities that

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,919
these businesses that we share to so

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,000
that might be a way to open up the doors

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
and the dialogue and really bridge and

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
build relationships between

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,720
the corporations as well as those

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
developers who

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,880
give information that's really important

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,039
for the corporations to do what they do

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,120
i think another thing that's been that

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,120
i've witnessed is

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,480
where a company hasn't been able to

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,880
necessarily participate

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,679
in the technical aspect for ip reasons

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,679
and so on

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,600
of a project but they've been getting

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
involved in other aspects of an open

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
source project like

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
um supporting governance or

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,240
documentation or

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,760
sponsoring diversity um travel and

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
tickets and that sort of thing so that

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,039
people from the community can

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,720
can meet up and come together or even

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,600
just hosting them locally in the office

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,919
and those are

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,360
those are other ideas i would like to

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,440
inspire you all with like

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,960
yeah exactly exactly that's definitely a

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,600
way to do it like there are tons of

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,120
things that

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
we can do just a little research but

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,400
again i really want to drive home the

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,400
point that this does not have to be

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
um it doesn't have to be expensive it

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,520
doesn't have to be something that's

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
cost prohibitive it can be something

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
that's very simple that's very

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,679
straightforward and is inexpensive and

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,280
can scale so if you have tons of folks

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,120
that you need to show appreciation to

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
um you can do that without that costing

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,159
a lot

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,080
so we're we're nearing the end of our

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
time together i just was curious um if

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
there were any other parting thoughts in

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
terms of like

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,559
best practices or nuggets of advice

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,880
you'd want to

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,840
impart upon our colleagues here today

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,640
one thing i would say

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,159
is to um clearly with open source

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
communities you all are doing a great

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,600
job volunteering

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,520
giving your time and your expertise in

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,360
those communities but really reaching

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,280
out beyond the community itself and

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
looking at organizations that you can

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
support

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,159
everyone in this room has such

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,120
tremendous expertise and tremendous

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,640
knowledge

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,039
you mentioned earlier that i've worked

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,960
with girls who code in black girls code

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,280
and those girls can post circles around

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
me so my contribution is more

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,039
moral support if you will than it is

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,240
actually teaching but you all are in a

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,440
position where you

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,760
have such expertise there so um and when

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,960
those girls or young men or young women

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,039
whoever you volunteer with

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,120
when they see you and when they see you

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,120
show up in their communities

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
they remember that right they remember

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
that and they

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,760
go to high school to learn more and they

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
go on to college and say

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,799
well you know what i wasn't sure what i

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,159
wanted to be but i remember when i was

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,840
12 there was this

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
guy that came in or there was this lady

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,400
that came in and you know they not only

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,320
taught me

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,080
python they only taught me javascript

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,039
but they were just really a cool person

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,039
they spent their time

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,640
maybe i'll look at pursuing that because

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,720
maybe i kind of want to be like them

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,279
that's really where it all starts so i

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,679
know that everyone in here has a

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,480
volunteerism heart and spirit if you

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,159
will

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,559
i know that everyone in here believes in

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,080
the tenets of inclusion in terms of them

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,520
including all types of people

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,600
in the open community and what that

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,960
means but also just really reaching out

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,880
to those communities that

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,159
you're a part of or even ones that you

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
don't know much about but you want to

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,200
hear more about i think that's a

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,120
great opportunity to do so particularly

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,640
in the lives of young people

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,720
i think it's a great point to end on

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,600
that something like 80 of the work is

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,960
just showing up

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,640
and being there um so and on that note i

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
want to say thank you all for showing up

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,159
to our

00:24:49,360 --> 00:25:00,270
panel we really and enjoyed having you

00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:03,480
and thank you
