Diversity and inclusion are hot topics across technology, open source and financial services, and justifiably so. Everyone agrees more needs to be done, but what does that actually look like? Attend this session to hear an honest discussion around best practices and lessons learned, from panel members who are on the front lines. Attendees will leave with proven action items and ideas that are tried-and-true, as well as a few actions to avoid.
