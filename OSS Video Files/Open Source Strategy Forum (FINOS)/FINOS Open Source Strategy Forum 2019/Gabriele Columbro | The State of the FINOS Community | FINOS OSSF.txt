Gab Columbro is the Executive Director for FINOS. As an introduction to OSSF 2019, Gab gave a "State of the Community" talk about where open source, financial services, fintech, banking, and regulation are going into 2020.

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm Gabriela Cumbre I'm the executive

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,150
director of Venus I'm gonna try to keep

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,119
it short it's not my forte I'm Italian I

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,740
talk a lot but I want to leave the stage

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:33,270
actually our community because really

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,070
today is about you it's about you know I

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,719
think the message is way more powerful

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,910
when our community members and our

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,829
contributors talk about it and so I just

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,540
want to give you a quick you know

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,980
overview of the State of the Union the

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,780
state of the community where we are

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,950
today and where we're going to go for

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,379
the foreseeable future

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,390
so there's two things that I'd like you

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:03,239
to take away from the conference today

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:07,560
is financial services and open source is

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,780
not an oxymoronic phrase anymore we're

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,729
serious about open source and I hope

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,280
that throughout the day you'll see how

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,930
this can make a change in the industries

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,080
already making a change in the industry

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,170
not just in Phoenix but above and beyond

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,570
what we're doing within our community

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:30,150
and secondly and most importantly how

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,530
open source is a massive opportunity for

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,360
you individually

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,240
I mean communities are built our of

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,700
individuals but also for your

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,560
organization whether you work for a

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,579
financial institution whether you work

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,170
for the company whether you work for

00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:50,790
regulator or whether you're just you

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,570
know promoting yourself it's finally

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,820
here and it's you have to stay so

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,820
without further ado for those of you who

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:06,420
don't know finis and how many of you

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:10,110
don't know finis good we have we're now

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,500
in our 18 months since we launched the

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,340
company since then we've seen three

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,840
the fantastic growth behind me you know

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,870
I want to send a shout out to our

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,260
members Todd thank the sponsors for

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,990
today but our foundation would not exist

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,910
without our members and so I want to

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,700
send a shout out I think you know the

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:37,140
the most amazing at least for my

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,950
perspective aspect of our community we

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,300
have a very diverse community from

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,260
companies coming from financial services

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,350
tech companies fin tech companies we add

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,209
the dizzier only are only some

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:55,560
additional financial institutions but we

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,390
have services and product vendors you

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,540
know the community is growing at the

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,480
pace that you know nor even when we

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,700
launched without the woods and so you

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,000
know I want again send a shout out to

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,640
our members having said that our

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,560
community is much bigger than just our

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,350
members this is an open source community

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,730
everyone is welcome to participate so by

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,980
no means you should only be a member we

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,230
welcome contributions from any of you

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,340
and this conference is really the moment

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:33,450
where you know we welcome and we hope

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,640
ideas will spark not only we grew in

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,459
members over the last year just give you

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,940
a quick overview of you know some of the

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,130
breadth of our community we add some you

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,829
know pretty substantial contributions

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,989
and that's what I say the industry

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,209
serious about open source this is not

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,540
just about you know putting a brand a

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,709
logo up there you know saying that

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,329
you're supporting an open-source

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,549
foundation we've had some pretty

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,040
substantial contributions ranging from

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,360
you know perspective for example if

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,230
you're familiar with it it was a

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,200
contribution from JPMorgan it's a very

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,650
advanced very mature truly open source

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,820
data visualization framework based on

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,260
webassembly again open source code

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,120
another big achievement of the last year

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,450
has been at this e3 it's an open

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,180
standard for interoperability desktop

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,930
interoperability again open source

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,250
standards and finally again just one of

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,820
the many projects that we have there

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,470
focused around data we do have not only

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,810
data he leads through the contribution

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,360
from one of our members Scott logic from

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,990
the UK but we also have several Open

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,490
Data initiatives from security reference

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,669
working group to financial objects group

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,289
again just to show you the breadth of

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,120
it's not just about open source code is

00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,039
not just about open standards is not

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,810
just about open data there are so many

00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:02,900
ways that we could be collaborating and

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:06,570
Finas provides you know the forum for it

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,840
we are more and more looking at also

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,509
what happens beyond our community open

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
source you know again by the very nature

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,190
of community shouldn't just be limited

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,370
what we do within our community but the

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,490
effect that we're having on financial

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,770
services doing open source again above

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,190
and beyond the projects that we see in

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,940
the Finnish getup repository these are

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:36,090
numbers provided from our by our

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,940
Platinum Member github from 2018 but

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,830
just to give you an idea these are only

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,099
associated these are commits

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,520
repositories and committers associated

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:51,900
to financial services github accounts

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,110
from you know a domain standpoint again

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,180
these are pretty big numbers but you

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,789
know if you think about the potential

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,090
population of developers within the

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:06,990
industry there's so much more to go but

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:09,539
again this is not you know this is not

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,639
any more you know open source and

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,970
financial services fit in the very same

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,090
phrase now I don't want to paint just a

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:22,050
happy picture here there's still a lot

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,759
to go we still see financial

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,159
institutions and even fin tech companies

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,409
some very you know in a very broad

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:31,860
spectrum of maturity as far as open

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,780
source readiness go but even in just in

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,370
the last two years and two years of

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,520
phenols we have seen massive progress

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:46,699
one point here you see on the top layer

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:48,080
those sorry top right I guess yes you

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:53,960
know people that tell me no we don't do

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:57,530
open-source and I mean that's a little

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,050
bit of a misconception you all are using

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,539
open-source one way or another you might

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,520
not be contributing but let's be clear

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,830
if you think that your developers are

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,229
not using open-source that's probably

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,080
your you know worst nightmare situation

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,970
you wanna have policies in place to

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,370
allow them to do open source because

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,410
trust me they'll find a way to do it and

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,070
you want to be able to harness that

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,289
power and that's where Finas comes in

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:27,080
not only we Shepherd programs and

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,509
projects and would love to talk to you

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,030
about our existing projects or idea that

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,860
you have today for new projects but we

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,110
also do a lot of enablement again to

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,960
bring everyone up to par in the curve of

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,560
open-source readiness so please come and

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,759
talk to us that are both number six I

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,919
believe now I want to spend a couple of

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,340
minutes before I leave it to much

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,349
smarter people than me and our community

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,780
but we look back now I want to look

00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:00,469
quickly forward well what's in store for

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,550
us I think it's fair to say and

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,729
hopefully in the next couple of minutes

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:08,180
and throughout the day I'll be able to

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:10,310
show you why it's not inconceivable to

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,310
think that moving forward financial

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,169
services will be powered the core of the

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,210
financial services system will be power

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,930
out of open source very much like we've

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:26,030
seen in so many other industries and why

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:27,620
is that I mean look we all know the

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,479
industry is undergoing the digital

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,240
transformation the move to the cloud

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:36,169
there's this strive for innovation but

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,120
why is that well you know even in the

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:44,930
last nine years revenue for the top 12

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,089
banks has gone down 39 billions that's

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:52,430
like if Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan will

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:54,140
disappear so in the end this this strive

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,560
for innovation is not really anymore

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,470
just

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,440
optimization or efficiency it's a vital

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:03,080
need for this industry to rain then the

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,360
way they build technology and so the

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,130
battlefield has moved from getting the

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,950
best Raiders to having the best

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,810
technology so sort of just throwing

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,720
money at the problem it's now gonna

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,870
correct that's why you see this sort of

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,510
hate and love relationship with the

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,330
Silicon Valley I mean one hand sort of

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,400
these you know many of the mentors of

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,650
the West Coast being taken and brought

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,190
in in in this industry and I'm actually

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,720
based in San Francisco but but on the

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,420
other hand sort of this idea that

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,610
they're a big pack is sort of you know

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,510
eating out of the business here and the

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,029
East Coast because they're not regulated

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,370
but you know I don't think that beanbags

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,750
I actually gonna cut it I don't think

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,570
that just throwing an Innovation Lab

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,180
it's enough we hope that throughout the

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,660
day you'll see how open source can be a

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,270
fundamental part and why has reason to

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,790
really see a your level concern you guys

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,550
need to have an open source strategy I

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,260
mean to be fair there has been a little

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,760
bit of cross-pollination here and there

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,589
especially as far as the dress code goes

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,960
she's just by walking around Midtown you

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:18,560
can probably see how you know

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,830
button-down shirts and vests you know

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,290
very similar now across both coasts and

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,820
just allow me around here I you know how

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,860
is it that to appeal to financial

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,500
services developers now I gotta wear a

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,390
vest and a button-down shirt like I'm

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,570
Italian don't don't tell people at home

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:39,290
I might just be disowned but anyway

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,170
that's that's what it is and so I want

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,839
to make sure you guys understand that

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,880
you know probably with a simple example

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,709
I mean we all now realize and I think

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,800
this is a big difference that I'm not

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,930
sure if it's clear and you know I think

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,000
definitely not community

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,940
residual edition I'm very much like

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,700
cloud you know we realize that hardware

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,770
is not a differentiator anymore at least

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,570
for many of the workloads and so make

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,970
sense to go to cloud every company's

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,980
going through the digital transformation

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,700
well our proposition is that there is a

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,820
whole other layer on top of hardware

00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,970
that you know is not differentiating

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,800
it's a commodity layer of sort which is

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,260
very much built out of open-source and

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,960
this I think is the throat best open

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,780
secret from the west coast meaning most

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,620
of the companies that either run SAS

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,020
services or offer sort of big pack they

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,300
really build probably 10 20 % of their

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,450
applications 80% is out of open source

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,450
I've read the survey from NPM where they

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,520
were estimating 95% of the application

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,680
being built on open source and so then

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,650
you wonder why you know

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,310
no wonder you know every day there is a

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:57,890
an advantage gained because they're much

00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,960
faster much more efficient to just focus

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,890
on competitive differentiator and what

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:07,220
delivers actual value now want to make

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:12,050
sure I stay on time again not my forte

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:15,770
but we talked about the top line with

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:21,230
the bottom line again it's is that a

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:24,170
similar sort of shrinking pattern you

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,750
know again since the last since 2010

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,050
it's estimated that compliance budgets

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,710
have gone up 30% up to really 15% of the

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,350
IDS Pandits a massive increase and it's

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:41,000
certainly compounding with the revenue

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,740
shrink not only that but I think there's

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,320
an opportunity here and hopefully today

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,520
you'll hear it and you hopefully agree

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,990
with us that there's an opportunity

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,110
because if you think about regulatory

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,540
requirements well those are those apply

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,850
to every company in this industry and

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,390
they're just an item on the bottom line

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,790
they don't you know deliver value to you

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,520
and so if you think about it those are

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,310
really the type of things that you know

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,960
non-competitive IP where there's really

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,780
potential for collaboration and so what

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,980
we will you know finis you're gonna see

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,810
it more and more and you gotta hear it

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,620
today will have some really nice

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,040
announcements or

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:26,100
identity regulatory model a regulatory

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,770
modeling we have a cloud certification

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,030
project that we love you for you guys to

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,430
check out and we have a session today

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,160
originally contributed by JP Morgan but

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,860
we think there's a huge opportunity in

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,490
what we call compliance code especially

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,050
is open source code because not only

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,290
financial institutions can neutralize

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,720
the cost nor only thing that companies

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,530
could have a much more level playing

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,470
field and on-ramp towards being in this

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:59,100
business but we think the regulator's

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,980
who are actually in a much deeper talent

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,740
crunch than then you know other

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,590
organization would have a huge benefit

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,450
to have regulation defined as code as

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,370
open-source code there's a common core

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,950
that we could all use it would be much

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:20,700
more efficient and transparent and so

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:23,520
look I'm gonna wrap it just by saying we

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,470
think that the advantages of open

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,240
sourcing financial services are not just

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,070
limited to the technology organization

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,290
again throughout the day you'll

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,850
hopefully hear how the business has

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,650
grown very aware of what open source

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,990
collaboration and open collaboration can

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:43,070
bring to this industry you'll hear it in

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,680
a second from our chair and vice-chair

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:50,370
who can talk about that much more sort

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:54,150
of powerfully than I can but I want to

00:14:50,370 --> 00:15:02,310
throw a challenge here this is a quote

00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:04,950
that it's from me today and I wanna I

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,160
wanna see I think it's not inconceivable

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,660
to say that in 10 years very much like

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,520
other industries the core of this

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,550
industry could be run out of open source

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,400
but don't be mistaken we need your help

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,460
to get there so please talk to each

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,290
other come to our booth learn how you

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,250
can contribute there's no price tag

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,510
attached to it

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,640
it's gonna be good for you as an

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,670
individual and for your organization

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:33,520
and we can talk at OSF 2029 whether

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,590
we we actually got there so have an

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,660
amazing conference and thank you for

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,900
being here

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,900
[Applause]

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:50,899
