Most software products and services today are based on free and open source software. It is a great catalyst for rapid development and standardization, but if the R&D teams are not properly trained in incorporating open source software components into the products they build, unnecessary risks and costs are introduced.

In an M&A transaction context it is particularly important to know the details of the software you acquire and have full control of its origins and licensing terms. This is typically revealed in an M&A open source audit.

M&A audits should be performed quickly and accurately under the utmost confidentiality, with tools that provide high degrees of accuracy, performance, privacy and automation. In this equation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fundamental component.

In this session the audience is given an update on how AI can dramatically lower costs and reduce risks in the software auditing of an M&A transaction process.
