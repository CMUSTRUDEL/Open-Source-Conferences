Neema Raphael is the Co-Chief Data Officer, and the Co-Head of Data Intelligence for Goldman Sachs. He and FINOS Director of Programs, Rob Underwood, sat down for a fireside chat at OSSF in New York to discuss FINOS Platinum member Goldman Sachs intention to open source two products - a modeling language internally named "PURE", and a visual modeling platform that generates PURE models known in Goldman Sachs as "Alloy" - into FINOS. 

WHAT IS PURE?

PURE is a modeling language inspired in part by languages such as the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and UML. PURE also has many elements of a functional programming language. Goldman Sachs uses PURE to create and construct internal models for functions such as reporting and clearing. 

WHAT IS ALLOY?

Alloy is a visual modeling environment and system that creates, maintains, and helps distribute models built in PURE. Behind the scenes, Alloy uses git, (fellow FINOS member) Gitlab for its SDLC (software development lifecycle), and standard source control concepts to manage changes to, and reviews of, models. Alloy can also generate code in languages and formats such as SQL, JSON, JSON Schema (and, internally to Goldman Sachs, SLANG) in order to import and update target systems & infrastructure w/ revised model definitions/extensions.

[Music]

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,949
so my name is Rob Underwood I'm the

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,380
director of programs for finis we have

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,109
ten programs and about 105 projects

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,900
about an equal number of github and get

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,390
lab repositories that sit within those

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,609
projects if you're interested in

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,019
learning any more about our projects or

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,090
programs come find me we're also be

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,010
doing a lightning round a little later

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,070
and you can hear more about it

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,660
but I wanted to introduce and Neema

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,180
Rafael who's the chief technology

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,440
officer at Goldman Sachs and could tell

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,000
us a little bit about yourself and then

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,860
we'll get into the business of the

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,969
matter today yeah chief yes I chip data

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,949
practice that like 10 times yeah hi Nima

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,140
Rafa I've been at Goldman about 16 years

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,930
always as a software developer at

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,049
Goldman both on the tech side and

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,080
Strasse on side and currently run our

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,400
data data group and I'm the co chief

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,590
data officer for Laura cool sounds like

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,369
interesting job it sounds like even more

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,590
interesting than maybe the chief

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,869
technology officer okay so some folks

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,090
might have heard the buzz but so I think

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,700
you came here to announce something I'm

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,780
I know I'm gonna be surprised so I'm

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
excited about it but maybe you'd like to

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,570
tell us a little bit about what brings

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,180
you here and what you're here to

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,990
announce yeah first I want to say thanks

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,680
everybody for having us at OSF we at

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,110
Goldman were huge proponents big fans of

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,420
open source in the open source community

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,770
and we also love Venus for pushing sort

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
of that community forward in the

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,340
financial services so thanks for having

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,119
us

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:57,479
yeah today I'm super excited to announce

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,689
our intention to open source one of the

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,960
key cornerstones of our data ecosystem

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,549
at goldman sachs it's a data platform

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,429
we've been building internally for a

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,429
number of years called alloy so

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,970
so what actually is a Loy some people

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,420
call it a data modeling tool you know I

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,550
think it's much broader than that I sort

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,240
of describe it holistically as a data

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,370
management and data API platform what

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,210
exactly does that mean

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:40,410
you know alloy lets you basically design

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:45,630
build publish data pipelines and data

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:49,020
api's and gives a platform for you to

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:55,200
reliably run those API zhim and

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:57,120
pipelines in a in a hosted service so no

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,860
sir there's also the pure element the

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,650
modeling language itself which yes there

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,020
is thing - that's right so pure and we

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,510
call the whole ecosystem alloy now pure

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,470
is the underlying you know language or

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,810
DSL we use to describe that data you

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,970
know I recognize I used a bunch of sort

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,770
of buzzwords there so maybe just to give

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,110
a concrete example of that's okay the

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,459
creator of C++ is coming up after you so

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,170
I think we're good on the technical

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,810
stuff we'll just keep going here yeah

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,250
again if we get into you know lengthy

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,440
explanation of monads we'll know that

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,760
we've gone too far but I think it's okay

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,930
with this crowd so so how may be tell us

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,700
a little bit more about how pure and

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,190
alloy you work together so pure as I

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,920
understand it is a DSL and then alloy

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,750
the larger ecosystem but also the

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,360
modeling tool is something that can be

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,250
used to generate pure models and then I

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,290
think as I understand it those models

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,330
can then be used to actually affect

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,200
changes in underlying physical databases

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,360
and stuff like that

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,489
yeah so maybe I'll just throw the

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,950
concrete exam yeah sure or instead of

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,510
talking in the abstract so you know say

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,600
you want to use some data for analysis

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,600
or you want to share some data with with

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,640
a broader team different team that team

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,160
could be you know internal to your org

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,110
it could be a client it could be a

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,459
counterparty or even potentially a

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:19,799
regulator and and say you want to share

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,450
that share some data some trade data

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,480
right in that trade data comes from

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,310
various different sources

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,750
different it'll have different

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,610
attributes you know trade could have

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,400
trade date or quantity direction

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,590
whatever but it also has linkages to you

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,890
know different other data sets so maybe

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,650
a count or client data maybe a variety

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,960
of product attributes from a product

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,860
master or even people information like

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,410
who the trader was sales person customer

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,770
and so what alloy really lets you do is

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,130
simply and consistently sort of define

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,530
those concepts as business concepts and

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,360
then let you normalize the data to those

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,320
business concepts and publish it for

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,130
users to self-serve through api's than

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,590
you ice-cool so it sounds like you're

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,850
doing a ton of modeling using alloy

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,720
generate your models within Goldman and

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,580
as I understand it

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,620
part of what's gonna happen now is is it

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,730
by open sourcing this has to be an

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,110
opportunity for the industry to use

00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,910
alloy to do some common and shared

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,290
modeling what do you sort of what do you

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,520
see is sort of the benefit of sort of

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,440
taking what you're currently doing

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
internally at Goldman in terms of the

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,260
modeling and then we'll get into the

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,320
code in a second but the modeling piece

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,850
what why do that with your industry

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,280
partners and your competitors and

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,860
everyone else oh yeah I mean look just

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,100
even internally right I think it's been

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,960
a huge boost for Goldman just to talk

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,270
about their data in a consistent manner

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,360
I think if you take nothing away the way

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,280
that we've sort of defined concepts use

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,680
the same words for the same concepts

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,410
across the firm has had an enormous

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,010
enormous benefit now usually that's sort

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,010
of disjoint from the actual execution of

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,410
getting data but the pure alloy sort of

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,300
world is actually the modeling piece and

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,280
the execution piece so you get to you

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,470
get to describe it consistently but also

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,330
query and retrieve your data whether

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,490
you're a developer engineer or not

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,070
engineer in a consistent fashion through

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,670
the same API is and description language

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,440
so we've seen enormous benefits just

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,140
across teams and I think we just want to

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,690
bring that sort of out to the world to

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,249
share across not just internal teams but

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,019
across the industry and

00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,819
Krauss clients and counterparties and

00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,279
again like I said potentially even

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,559
regulators who could form more formally

00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,079
specify things that that we that we

00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,689
could all sort of explain together

00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,339
instead of like in a word doc or PDF

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:54,509
totally so it sounds like this is a you

00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,429
know this is a substantial piece of

00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,729
really two pieces of software that work

00:06:56,429 --> 00:07:02,159
together you would imagine there's a lot

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,899
of work to sort of take this Goldman

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:07,139
code and sort of decouple it and

00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:09,479
abstract it and mod utilize it and all

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,759
that good stuff so what's the rough

00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,799
timeline for how this is gonna be a

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,789
pilot in January and then where is it

00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:17,009
kind of going from there

00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:19,199
yeah so we're working closely with the

00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,569
finish crew and and some of the get lab

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,519
crew to actually completely as you

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,499
mentioned decouple it from gs systems

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,929
and actually get it running in the cloud

00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:29,639
and I and I believe in us is actually

00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:32,099
going to be running yep so that's

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,439
amazing so that'll prove I guess to us

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,809
and the world that you know this has no

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:40,139
sort of ties to Goldman as we

00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:41,939
open-source it so first in January we'll

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,629
actually have it running hosted in finis

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:49,289
yep and then we're planning in the

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:52,889
middle of next year to release the full

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:54,479
platform code oh yeah so and and so

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,479
there's a pilot period starting in

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,249
January for the first roughly the first

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,959
quarter so there'll be more information

00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:03,119
there's a press release that's probably

00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,919
gone out by now and then a fact that you

00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:07,139
if you're interested in getting involved

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,659
in the pilot during the first quarter

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,129
you can take a look at that what do you

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,729
see as being sort of the longer-term

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:17,699
benefits so you've been involved in the

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:20,639
open source movement Goldman has for a

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,159
while a lot of sort of the origin story

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,469
of innos goes back to open source

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,779
efforts by a Goldman and a number of the

00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:30,929
other estimate banks what do you see is

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,719
sort of the the benefits and and why are

00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:35,009
your wires Goldman getting evermore and

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,599
so not just the fitness community which

00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,389
we appreciate but just the open source

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:43,289
effort more generally yeah absolutely I

00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:45,089
mean just maybe talk personally for a

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,889
minute and then go with like I'm you

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,379
know I'm a computer scientist at heart i

00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:52,170
I'm sort of a hippie I went to school

00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:55,110
Berkeley and so I we think you know

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,420
software should be shared and especially

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,970
public utilities that could help all of

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,060
us you know from a Goldmann side

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,440
obviously we care a lot about the

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,180
commute the open-source community we

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,950
consume a lot open source and we want to

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,820
publish back I see a lot of faces here

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,890
open ear that down row here so you know

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,070
we we care about it for talent retention

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,810
for keeping up with with the world at

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,550
large and and software is a new world

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,710
now you have to be both in it and

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,790
consuming it or else yeah you're not a

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,100
technology shop

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,380
great and when you start getting pull

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,050
requests once you've get the codes

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,610
already and it's been you know you know

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,550
middle next year so it's been made

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,840
available and get lab repository what do

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,910
you see as being some of the benefits

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,890
the developers being able to do actual

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,960
pull requests the underlying code to

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,280
pure and alloy what are some benefits of

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,100
that deals along with the actual

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,200
modeling itself absolutely look again I

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,330
think we want to put we want to put this

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,250
out there we hope people find it useful

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,110
for them and and we hope that we grow

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,690
the community together right again the

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,390
the point of sort of giving this over to

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,580
fin us and and sort of providing to the

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,710
community is that it's a community asset

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,080
now and and that people could help us

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,110
push the platform in the direction that

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,360
everyone wants instead of one instead of

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,180
one team wants great so we already have

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,920
several other banks that have indicated

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,590
their interest in participating the

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,100
pilot if you're interested you know find

00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:25,140
me or find the forum and we'll talk more

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,510
Nima this has been fantastic thank you

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,290
so much we're excited that you've made

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,840
this decision

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,320
rock on thank you so much great job

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,320
thank you

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:46,489
