Bjarne Stroustrup, Creator of C++ and Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, was one of our keynote speakers for the FINOS Open Source Strategy Forum (OSSF) 2019. 

Bjarne's keynote talk, "C++ Core Guidelines Project" discusses the questions "What is good modern C++?", and "What would you like your code to look like in 5 years time?".

Code is often the focus for an open-source project, though rarely the only focus; there is also documentation, tutorials, and more. “Open-source” can also provide a forum that enables unlikely collaborations. Bjarne briefly describes the C++ Core Guidelines, a project involving people from many organizations aiming to guide developers to a type- and resource-safe style of efficient C++, supported by tools and a small library.
