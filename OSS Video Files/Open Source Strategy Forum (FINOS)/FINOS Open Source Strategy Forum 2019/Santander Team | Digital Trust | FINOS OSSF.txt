[Music]

00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:20,570
hi everyone I for the folks who didn't

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,000
see the the the very quick intro that I

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,189
did earlier are gonna do a super fast

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,260
summary of it again just to remind you

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,910
why you're here my name is rod Boothby

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,509
I'm the global head of identity it sent

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,390
in there it takes a concerted effort

00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:39,620
significant costs to understand who

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,449
somebody is to actually fully identify

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,539
them for a bank know your customer if

00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:45,829
this is not it's not minor expenses for

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,969
us if they're they're actually really

00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:52,370
significant and it requires even more

00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:55,059
cost and effort to protect that identity

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,030
to protect that identify and information

00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:00,920
merchants incur huge costs either

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:04,220
because they are trying to keep in touch

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,039
with and in the requirements of privacy

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,550
laws or because they lose that data

00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:15,619
witness things like Marriott losing a

00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:18,140
hundred million passports amazing huge

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:22,310
fines huge legal costs huge reputational

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,439
damage these costs and these risks in

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,350
digital commerce are all focused on

00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,689
identifying somebody but why do we need

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,079
to identify somebody what we need to do

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:37,810
is to trust them you need to be able to

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:43,520
trust the basic thing and basically

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:46,280
identity is salt so we know and we can

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,659
identify people the problem instead is

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,390
trust how do we establish a digital

00:01:50,659 --> 00:02:01,630
trust how do we create an environment

00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:04,969
where people trust each other okay so

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,460
what does it mean to trust someone Trust

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,769
is a key element in supporting digital

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,519
transactions it's the product of

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:15,620
informed risk the idea is we need to

00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:18,440
understand whether a merchant will

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,299
receive payment whether a customer will

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,760
actually receive the product or service

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:25,489
they demand it like for instance my

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,400
current experience

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:32,030
the I won't mention the Crowne Plaza

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,129
Hotel but they have no hot water for

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,110
three days this actually it was kind of

00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,959
interesting here because they send me

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,970
these things each every six hours saying

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,390
con Edison promises to fix the problem

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,920
in six hours and I saw a bunch of Con Ed

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,290
people out on the street and ask them

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,870
hey how long is this gonna take to fix

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:54,670
and the woman running the crew who said

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:59,989
Oh about two days at least two days so

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,610
anyway trust okay so at least you get an

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:07,150
honest answer on the street right not

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:09,980
from your hotel that's of being informed

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,870
so how do we build a trust us risk

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:17,420
assessment we look at basic things we

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,940
want to know is this person who they

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,640
claim to be we want to know if they have

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,379
authority to act like for example is

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,870
this person really the CFO of a company

00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,049
is that person really in the counts

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,720
receivable did they send me a valid

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:36,549
invoice with real wiring instructions I

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,950
recently got an invoice from a very big

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,170
well-known consulting company for a heck

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,130
of a lot of money it was emailed to me

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,319
in word with wiring instructions I could

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,750
have you know got another Cayman Islands

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,060
it would have been fantastic about a

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,760
year's salary literally like crazy and

00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:00,349
that's not unusual actually that's quite

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,750
common out there how do we guarantee

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:06,470
that the information people share is

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,109
valid and accurate say I'm applying for

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,790
a loan and I want to be able to share a

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,819
bunch of information about my income and

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,829
where I live and all of those things how

00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,419
do I make sure I don't fat finger it or

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:20,359
make it a mistake how do I guarantee

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:22,280
that it's accurate um and most

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,039
importantly for me is a customer how do

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,860
I share summary information without

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:33,229
disclosing private details how on earth

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:36,200
do I protect my privacy so banks are in

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,610
a unique position to protect privacy to

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,250
answer these trust

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,990
questions and deliver a verified digital

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:48,740
identity there's demand for this too if

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,150
we look at we've gone out to the market

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,219
and we've looked at customers out there

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:56,030
digital marketplaces want verified

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:58,639
buyers and sellers industry industry

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,860
merchants need to know that they're who

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,900
their customers are customers need to

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,150
know who the merchant is b2b

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,830
participants need to know that the

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,389
counterparties are who they claim to be

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,669
all of these things and they're

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,229
interesting because they really change

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,120
the dynamic you can have somebody in

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,009
Peru selling I don't know some

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,110
handcrafted something rather for 200

00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,300
bucks if they're verified I can buy

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,639
directly from them not through a

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,719
middleman could have a very big impact

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,250
okay so given all of these kinds of

00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,689
things

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,449
merchants want them for things like

00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:35,689
hotel check-in for knowing that

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:37,550
somebody's that the the renter is is

00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:38,180
trustworthy or that the landlord is

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,069
trustworthy

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,680
same thing with eBay same thing with

00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,449
with Airlines that want to know that the

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,580
person who's on the plane is who they

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,500
claim to be they get fines tremendously

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,310
if they delivers the wrong person with a

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,870
wrong documentation to the wrong country

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,819
like somebody's sneaking on with false

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,339
ID on the British Airways landing here

00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:03,319
in the states and ice will take care of

00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:05,150
them for $50,000 that's expensive for

00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,849
for British Airways they don't want to

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,949
incur that kind of cost okay so we want

00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,750
to try and solve these problems and we

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,300
think we can do it by protecting

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,089
people's privacy as we do it they can

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,250
use us as a trusted intermediary the

00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,919
easiest and fastest way to deliver this

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,930
is to deliver this as a standard the

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,569
standard offers a level playing field

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,689
just like tcp/ip HTML any of those

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,879
things it means that all banks are in an

00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,039
equal position to offer it and we think

00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,719
that there are multiple levels here yeah

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,210
sure you could be a company with an ID

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,219
and password you can verify that you

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,500
might be a level two kind of company

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,120
like a Facebook where you can do some

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,610
multi-factor off but you don't really

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,279
know who this person is and then you can

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,009
be a regulated entity like a bank may be

00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,740
a utility that has to follow very strict

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:59,029
rules and guidelines and has followed

00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,729
deep and expensive kyc and then finally

00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:05,869
you could be an actual government

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:09,169
issuing that of that identity all right

00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:10,430
so we believe once in place once in

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,229
place with the open standard that you're

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,559
going to hear about today it's gonna be

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:17,839
very simple for us collectively to help

00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,339
fix this market what we're looking for

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,229
and the reason why we're here is we're

00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,469
looking for other financial

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:27,289
organizations and vendors and reliant

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,409
parties to join us in this it's a simple

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:33,620
model I have a holder of identity I go

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:34,939
to say eBay there are a live party I'd

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,039
say I'm going to be a verified seller

00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,509
I've never sold on eBay before but I

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,599
want people to trust me when I sell my

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:43,580
used bicycle for a thousand dollars they

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,219
say okay either hand over a bunch of

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,349
information or verify yourself with sent

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:50,869
in there so I go to sent Ender I log in

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,240
I asked Santa dear please tell me BAE

00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:55,849
that I'm good this is all done in a

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,979
quick simple ux fashion the message is

00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:01,219
sent to ebay and now i have a verified

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:03,620
check beside my name and if they want

00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,099
they can ramp up and attach liability to

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,289
do that

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:10,099
I can pay for it or have my buyer pay

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:12,169
for it and the bank gets an interesting

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:16,789
opportunity to generate profit out of

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:18,169
that the the community in the market is

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,469
more effective and more efficient

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,819
because we've added trust so as I said

00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,709

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,139
effort you're going to hear from my

00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:30,259
colleagues and they're going to work

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,649
[Applause]

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,839
hello guys let me first introduce myself

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,699
my name is Hilda from saw meadow and a

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,309
software engineer the director of

00:08:55,699 --> 00:09:00,290
innovation for Santander bank I also

00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:03,589
studied in the US for a while I have an

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,350
MBA by UCLA and a master in blocked him

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,850
from from Stanford and I just wanted to

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,769
say thank you do famous for having us

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,540
here it's very exciting to be here

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,779
sometime they're speaking about open

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,449
source and about digital trust so first

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,609
of all let me start my presentation with

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:23,139
a video to try to make a point a who

00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:23,139
like to make through

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,799
[Applause]

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,149
although the whole moral of the story is

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,790
that when you want to build something

00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:00,640
that you want people to follow and that

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,950
is scalable and adaptable and that has

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,480
the right security a protocol may be a

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,120
good idea because otherwise you have

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,860
this kind of issues so that's how we are

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,519
trying to solve the digital trust

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:16,149
problem in as Rob mentioned before we

00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,579
are highly audited but in our case we

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,370
see that as a benefit on the sense that

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,370
we have really verified data in our

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,560
systems and the protocol is what we are

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,540
putting in place to be able to actually

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,930
give the control of their data to our

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:35,500
customers so they can have frictionless

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,510
user experiences in which they share

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,880
what they need to share to actually get

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,500
the services that they want to get the

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,750
benefits as I mentioned before is our

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,510
scalability they collective effort to

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:50,019
put that together and the focus on

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,550
customer privacy so we didn't want to

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,260
reinvent the wheel we know that there

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,260
are some standards in the market are

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,540
trying to do similar things so we did

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,029
some research we were benchmarking

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,399
different options and we decided that

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,320
open ID is the right solution is the

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,959
right foundation for this so we are

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,450
building on top of open I did the reason

00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,209
is because they have a massive community

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,390
behind them as of 2016 they have more

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,490
than 6 million for Easter accounts they

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,160
are flexible and extensible they are

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,350
adaptable for different internal systems

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,649
so they support all the different tokens

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,149
and jws that we need to get the security

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,600
that we want to get for our customers

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,430
and it has been used for open banking

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,230
for those of you that are not familiar

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:40,800
eyes with the UK regulation is it was

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:44,290
issued by the CMA a few years ago and

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,959
the regulation was saying that the nine

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,630
biggest banks in the UK had to actually

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,240
make the data available to trusted

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,120
syntax to get access to the data through

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,829
api's so the fact that open IV was

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,410
already being used by f5 was a real

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:06,220
important point in in decision

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,990
then finally last but not least they

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,120
give us the opportunity to or they give

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,610
you they give you the option to have

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,350
customer consent to actually accept a

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,009
data request which is very important for

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,079
us so if open ID is there how are we

00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:22,449
extending of an idea what are we adding

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,639
on top so these are some of the

00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,170
Santander contributions there is more

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,779
ambitious roadmap that we will see later

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,540
but some of the key points that we have

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:33,699
been so far our security so security in

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,589
open ID is very optional we are

00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:38,649
enforcing the security to ensure our

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,959
customers privacy the level of assurance

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,839
is something that we are having on top

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,110
and let me explain the concept if I'm

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,600
going to buy alcohol to a store that I

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,730
am party that store need to need needs

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,790
to be billed embraces that they have the

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,459
right age to buy alcohol so that means a

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,560
very high level of assurance on the

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:03,160
contrary fine signing up for our social

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,589
media site I may not need us such a high

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,470
level assurance we are adding that on

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:11,290
the core of open ID the different proofs

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,649
so we have some cases in which you can

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,810
do a serial knowledge which means that I

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:19,180
tell you I previewed I'm about the age

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,610
that I have to be to buy alcohol but I

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,130
don't tell you my age and some other

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,290
cases you have verifying credentials so

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,970
we are having all that flexibility in

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,250
the protocol and then we have the

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,560
assertion trains which is a full syntax

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,019
that we are creating so that as a

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,180
customer I can share different proofs of

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,149
different things without actually

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,850
releasing any data and the alcohol point

00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:46,420
in which I give you a true back if lying

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:48,970
about the right age is a good example so

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,910
some of the flows that we are working on

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,800
the first one is actually you start the

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,040
flow and your device and and data flow

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,870
on the same device we example is you

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,059
signing up for social media right and

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,180
you have a register or verified by

00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:06,490
Santander option and here actually is

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,980
good to mention another enhancement that

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,529
we are adding on top of open ID which is

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,480
the fact that we are adding that part of

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,939
the protocol in which you verified that

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,180
the relying party the social media side

00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,890
that

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,420
you are sharing the data with is a

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:24,700
relying party that you can trust

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,890
next one another flow that we are

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,690
building on is the one that you start on

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,760
a device and you end up in other and

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,550
then the module example that Rob

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,680
mentioned is a good one right I start

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,410
the flow in my in my NOLA phone a

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,920
Marriott may finish the flow in the

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:46,290
computers and then I'm gonna play

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,290
another video to make another point

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,490
without trust people distance themselves

00:14:52,029 --> 00:15:02,709
from institutions and their leaders from

00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:04,990
the media and businesses because Trust

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:09,430
is the lifeblood of modern business

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:13,360
economy yet in a world that is more

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:16,779
networked than ever trust is harder to

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:21,089
earn than to lose so the big question is

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,089
how can we restore and sustain trust

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,279
success will be measured by the public's

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:33,360
trust by the public's trust in and

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:36,640
loyalty towards businesses like ours

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,480
told that trust and loyalty we need to

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,870
be sustainable

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,990
we need to man exchange in a way that

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:50,170
has an eye on the future I'm not just

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:52,750
today well for those dumb no hurt does

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,880
our chairwoman and about him so that's

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,420
how it's Ron Santander is building on

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,060
trust and how are we trying to make that

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,490
happen this is our Roma for the next few

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,940
months we have started with the protocol

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,010
documentation which is already in place

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,709
we are finalizing the first set up a

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,630
site reference implementation that we

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,790
will be testing with a partner in

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,649
production in a life environment in a

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,050
few weeks it's actually giving us great

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,100
feedback on the whole protocol on the

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,829
flow one and all the different

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,250
interactions we obviously were trying to

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,029
come to finis to look for four-color

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,590
collaborators and people that wants to

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,050
be part of this in

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:36,110
the ideas that we are constituting

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,270
different Engineering's group to work on

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,890
the under protocol that will be

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,660
polishing this the case for the

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,330
differently on partners and partners to

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,360
implement the protocol and then we have

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,770
already in plan a global hackathon with

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,960
many different suntanned there are

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,360
countries that will take place in London

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,730
in February and the whole idea is to

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,980
test to test the technical assets that

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,480
we already have in our sandbox and to

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,780
start generating more ideas about

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,060
digital trust finally the idea is at

00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,860
some point q12 opus to open the assets

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,260
to the wider community and that's our

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,920
plan and now I introduce you to Albert

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,330
apellido who will be extending the

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,830
insights around the protocol I'm doing a

00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:24,260
cool demo about how it works

00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:26,300
thank you hi my name is Alberto Pulido

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,910
and I'm not technical experience and

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,860
their innovation UK and I'm gonna take

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,990
you through some more technical details

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,060
about the protocol that's a question is

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:39,940
there any technically technical expert

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:43,070
developer in the audience right

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,990
so first to understand what the protocol

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,670
takes place and the different elements

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,090
within the ecosystem I have prepared is

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,370
a slide here a normal interaction from

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,870
the protocol is very similar to what we

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,110
experienced together the user experience

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,900
today so as a user you may be using a

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,860
third-party application to be a hotel to

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,630
be a rental car and the rental car may

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,630
be is asking you some some details so

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,490
you want to verify your village the

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:14,210
protocol will allow that the ryeom party

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:17,630
to a start conversation so that the ID

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,880
verification provider will connect with

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,490
the issuing authority the information

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,920
that the holding of the of the the valid

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,480
data that you have in this case if we

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,940
are abound as a bank you can actually

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,670
have that plugging into your own data

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,560
and then put the customer in the middle

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,290
so you you really like the customers to

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,560
a log on do your luvin normal logging

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,660
process then you have in-house and once

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,460
the customer understand what is the

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,010
information that we are sharing

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:50,390
after accepting an Italian party we'll

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:52,220
get data from a server side integration

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,110
point of view couple of things we have

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,020
to consider and about that very

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,779
important to have an ally log in case of

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,960
dispute somewhere we can be friends to

00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,210
to check uh suddenly something will run

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,789
and the user can complain its quality in

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,520
particular another allowing very

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:14,059
important is the directory we want to

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,740
trust entities not only people so it's

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,110
important and following the sing

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,299
approach that open bank in the UK you

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,909
have a directory and you have to be on

00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:25,760
board Australian party but at the same

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:28,130
time you have a technical element that

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,340
you can use william parties can use to

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,840
enroll with many many many different

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,210
verification providers you know in our

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,669
in our in a really automatic way by

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,669
presenting software state an assertion

00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:52,370
okay so this is even more detail that's

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,070
an example of a sample request and a

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,830
response when the protocol takes place

00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,200
what we have is a sequence of events

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,970
happening sequence of messages that are

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,299
exchanged between the different parties

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:08,029
in this case is the millennium party the

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:09,200
identity provider and the user which

00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,559
proble is running in a mobile

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,720
application or our web browser and this

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,809
example you will see the power of these

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,500
syntax where we are asking very very

00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:23,149
little things very detail assertions we

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,010
want to validate your name we want to

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,960
validate whether or not you have money

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,710
in your account and we want to validate

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,899
your country of residence and the

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,730
language itself allows for many many

00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:38,179
many different types of assertions and

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,360
claims and the way that we protect our

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:44,929
our customers is by just returning true

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,330
false if not the case may be the relying

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,880
party is actually asking for the data so

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,919
all that can feed becoming fit into the

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,649
protocol and we also protect our

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,840
customer privacy by returning an ID

00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,440
which is different for its millennium

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,020
party

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,140
so you may have your own identity but

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,390
nobody needs to know how many identities

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,010
you have in different places now so

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,100
that's why this is the way that we are

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:16,280
bringing the privacy in the core the

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:19,580
protocol to show K this we are going to

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,050
run through a demo this is a use case

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,820
that he very similar to the one that we

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,650
will put import in production in a few

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,150
weeks it's not this company this is

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,910
effect company but the concept is very

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,100
similar so here we have a company that

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,200
is offering quick jobs

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,090
temporary jobs for example now in

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Christmas time people looking for a

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,760
couple of weeks job and it's very

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,570
important for that company or for the

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,930
company looking looking for employees to

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,030
verify thoroughly you can do this using

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,550
your new passport there are many

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,940
providers you go there and schedule

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:58,610
passport you do many different strange

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,290
things in front of the device and you

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,110
disclose that all that information to

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:07,640
there to delay imparting and with that

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:10,280
information you get that validation that

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,400
the user is trusted what we are doing

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,950
here is do that same journey but more

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,080
more stressed straight you just click on

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,900
verify something there you enter your

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,950
credentials bank attention and then you

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,770
see exactly what is the information

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,770
illusion I can show you this life

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,020
exactly you can see this

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:46,320
okay so this is how our everything is

00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:49,080
looking for a job um we have some

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,940
information in that application looking

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,789
for the job goes to the notifications

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,070
area and there is a company that is

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:59,070
asking for verification for that person

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,049
before hiding I said you can do it

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,070
verified with Passport or you can just

00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:09,059
go straight baby if I wasn't in there

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:10,440
enter your credentials check the

00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,929
information that you that you are

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,350
receiving in this case they don't have

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:18,990
even a such email by the way I mean miss

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,789
spelt meaning of the email but it's up

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,769
to you I mean maybe they don't really

00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:24,809
need to validate your email all they

00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,399
want to validate is your name and your

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:30,870
date of birth

00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:34,879
so you accept and you get the sent under

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:37,139
seal or whatever you want so this is a

00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:38,970
tactic of them or something that will be

00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:40,970
launched in production with a different

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:45,360
company but same concept

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:48,409
um just for fun let's see this in action

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:53,610
you want to see its own code from calls

00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:56,009
happening in the background okay so for

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,129
I guess that we are very familiar with

00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:01,980
the postman connection and if you also

00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:05,720
are familiar with open ID you may know

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,940
this well-known URL which provides the

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,370
details from the server the capabilities

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,409
from that server you may be an opening

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,259
the provider but you may not support all

00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:18,629
the functionalities so here we are we

00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,350
are standing there that every single

00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:25,580
aspect of open ID in this case for

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:28,559
example we can tell the relying parties

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,860
what is the language that they can use

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,070
to query that operation what are the

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,500
claims available and by by setting a

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,960
standard we can extend this infinite

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,759
right the important things that know all

00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,289
the opening people right the

00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,759
verification provided we provide the

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:48,559
same functionality so it's important to

00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:51,130
have those automatic capabilities so

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,280
let's run through that

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,440
the cosmic collection this is the setup

00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,070
which means that you have to have some

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,840
private key we are we are adding this

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,780
functionality within postman just to

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,140
create another private key for you and

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,600
then the protocol is start in this EDT 8

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,130
of authorize this is an Allen point it's

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,470
following the same principle in in in

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,260
open banking in for PAP ice so you have

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,660
before doing the authorized user

00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:23,110
initiates oxidize that is the endpoint

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:25,539
that allows the tip allows the or opie

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,450
provider to validate who you are and if

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:31,960
you have the relevant access to do the

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,330
request such information so here we are

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,409
requesting subtly the claims that we

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:40,179
want similar to what I showed before and

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:46,690
very important this is the purpose for

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:48,250
why are you asking for the limit it

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,960
could be a regulatory thing it could be

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,090
to contact you in case you we have a

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,549
problem with your with the service so

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,890
whatever that comes here will be

00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,320
presented to the to the user so the

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:03,880
immaterial fails returns an ID and this

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:07,659
is the ID for the request then we do the

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:12,010
authorized here we have an example for a

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:14,169
standalone single page application or

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,690
mobile application in other situations

00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:19,390
you just redirect to our website but for

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:22,690
the purpose of this presentation I am

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,460
doing everything here I'm simulating

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,230
this is not part of the protocol this is

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,480
just the way that we are doing the

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,780
aluminum consent

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,919
so with logon we've a little credentials

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,450
we have changed the information that

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:38,559
will be presented to there to the user

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:42,340
so we added that information and will be

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,850
presented to the customer you provide

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,679
consent okay so this is these are the

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,600
claims that I will be providing consent

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,809
or maybe this time I don't know birth

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,809
date

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,610
okay

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,610
and I obtain a code

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:07,810
and if I pull the code here this is a

00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:15,910
token that I get very human readable as

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:19,720
you can see but I have a tool so here

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:22,330
you have the result so this is what

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,330
happened behind the scenes within our

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,670
protocol introduction and I believe

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:33,130
that's all I have for today all we have

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:35,290
for today remind you some last some laps

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:39,580
that something very ok come back to us

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:41,510
we are asking for for help and that's it

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,540
thank you for your attention today

00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:52,030
[Applause]
