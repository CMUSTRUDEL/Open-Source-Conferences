Description: 
	Rich Robinson | Bloomberg | Case Study: Challenges to Support Open Data | FINOS OSSF 2019

Rich Robinson, Head of Data Strategy and Standards for the Open Symbology Group, Bloomberg

This talk will give a synopsis of the work Bloomberg L.P. Has done with the Object Management Group in the development and support of the Financial Instrument Identifier (FIGI), the only open data identification framework for financial instruments. Exploring the reasoning on why a for-profit company would invest in, and continue to support open data, the speakers will cover internal and external challenges in doing so. The evolution of FIGI, and what the future may hold in regards to standards and regulation will be examined. Finally, a wrap up on the pros and cons of "competing" standards (open and licensed), drivers for innovation, and the good and bad impacts of regulation.

Rich Robinson's BIO

Rich Robinson is a senior executive with over 25 years of experience in the financial industry, across operations and technology functions. Starting in the Global Custody Operations of Bankers Trust Company in the early 1990’s, Rich has worked throughout the front, mid and back offices at NSCC, Merrin Financial, The Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank Securities AG, and Omgeo. Post-crisis, he worked in consulting capacities at Barclays to help bring on board the former Lehman Equity desk, and at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, leading the EMC engagement that defined the distribution, order flow, trade reporting, compliance, and related functions needed to bring together the two retail brokerage firms. Immediately prior to joining Bloomberg, he was a Partner in Wipro’s Capital Markets team.

Since the mid 1990’s, Rich has been heavily involved in the industry as an active participant of key working groups related to international data and messaging standards, including ISITC, FISD, EDM Council, ISO, ISDA, and SIFMA. He has led industry efforts in communication, data, unique instrument identification across asset classes, co-founding the first group on Unique Instrument Identification in 2000 and was a primary participant in the Best Practice work for ISO15022. He has was Convenor for the ISO Study Group on CFI’s and UPI, and led the ISO Working Group on the Unique Transaction Identifier. Rich is on the Board of Directors of ISITC, and serves as 2nd Vice Chair.

A regular speaker at conferences, he has been published in the Journal of Securities Operations and Custody, Waters, and Inside Reference Data, among other global financial services publications. His most recent paper, “A linguistics approach to solving financial services standardization,” introduces the innovative idea to use applied linguistics to guide standards development and regulatory decisions, and was published in the Journal of Financial Markets Infrastructure.

Richard is currently head of Data Strategy and Standards for the Open Symbology group at Bloomberg LLP. He works globally with regulators, legislators, and industry leaders on addressing data and standards issues to create more efficient and transparent markets. He holds an MBA in Organizational Behavior and Information Technology from NYU’s Stern School and a B.S. in Industrial Management with a concentration in Management Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University.

[Music]

00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:19,320
so this boy was pretty exciting good

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,000
conversations good presentations mines

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,630
me brings me back to when I was a kid

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,630
and I hate dating myself but in 1984 my

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,920
dad brought home an IBM PC with two

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,170
floppy drives in it friend gave me a

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,550
phone number to dial up and I got

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,270
connected to the world of Volta moored

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,270
systems and there were all these people

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,860
writing code sharing it out there and

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,629
forming this whole community so brings

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,180
me right back to today in the the open

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,780
source community and that's you know

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,770
full of vibrancy and very exciting so

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,960
what I want to talk to you today is

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,129
about Bloomberg's journey in open data

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,550
give a little background on what Figgy

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,860
is as well as journey we went through

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,960
the challenges whatnot and then a little

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,760
look at the future and what the

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,110
situation looks like today and open data

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:17,159
standards and open source so just

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,130
generally the talk today yep not going

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,900
to there's a lot of talk about the

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,360
reasons for open source it's been well

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,939
covered in previous conferences so I do

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,829
want to give credence them about you

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,259
know the difference between core

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,329
structure and differentiators and having

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,820
a light and self and surround that I

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,460
know Russell from Deutsche Bank this

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,790
morning had mentioned about how open

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,030
source helps reduce costs and also

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,009
talent retention i'll contrast that a

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,380
little bit with open data later on but

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,799
Bloomberg support for open source and

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,229
open data we use github everything else

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,390
but also we have things like we have two

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,490
full time senior engineers supporting

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,310
things like Jupiter lab steering council

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,520
so Bloomberg's really behind the the the

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,890
open source and supporting the industry

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,400
so that extends into our work and open

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,439
data take you back to 2010

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,819
Bloomberg had somewhere the problem if

00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,760
anybody's familiar with the Bloomberg

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,739
systems in the terminal there's these

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,569
things called yellow keys I've been at

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,519
Bloomberg for five years now and I

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,220
actually avoided touching Bloomberg

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,250
until I came in but there is actually

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:35,049
the yellow keys are basically broken up

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:38,140
by asset class 2010 each yellow key was

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:40,090
its own data silo own data model it

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,430
didn't really have much around standards

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,019
around identification tickers change

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,230
which meant that the data model had to

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:49,150
change and it's just sort of made it

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,849
difficult if you have a single platform

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,090
like the terminal be able share data and

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:57,989
start to interoperate across it so the

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,060
goal was to look at creating a

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:04,480
persistent permanent identifier that

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,340
doesn't change more of a framework as

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,670
opposed to just a single identifier so

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,579
based around metadata and extensible and

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:15,099
that you know would be able to go across

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,560
like asset classes was not asked class

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,220
dependent but really more of like a

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,290
framework model data model that could

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:31,109
transverse the models within the

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:31,109
terminal and enable interoperability so

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:42,489
if you think about framework the biggest

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,609
analogy I come up with is the power

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,500
systems that we have in the world right

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,599
it'd be great if you could just go to

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,340
another country take all your appliances

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,180
and just plug it right in but that's

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,190
just not the way it works and

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,349
theoretically be great but practically

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,120
it's not possible there's installed

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,560
manufacturing base everybody has their

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,909
hair dryers and appliances you're not

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,870
gonna throw those away and buy brand new

00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:10,959
ones so you come up with something like

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,970
the power adapter chart IQ has this

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,959
little block available so definitely

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,459
stop by their desk because I love that

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,579
thing

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,620
Figgy in the same way operates like this

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,850
adapter across the identification

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,190
framework

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,050
identifiers have there's thousands of

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,630
them out there whether it tickers Cusick

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,230
license whatever it have and they're all

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,850
there for different purposes but it's a

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,910
many to one relationship or one-to-many

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,950
relationship in many times and you're

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,070
not gonna get rid of systems that are

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,500
based around ticker let's say because

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,840
front office traders like tickers and

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,340
they're embedded in old systems legacy

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,560
systems you're not going to rip all that

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,540
out so the best way to make these things

00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:02,230
interoperate with each other is use an

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:05,260
adapter and Figgy operates that way this

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,030
is an example this is IBM common stock

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,560
traded on New York Stock Exchange that's

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,730
the actual Figgy so if you look that up

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,650
it'll pull up that data that's just core

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,960
data for us right it's just descriptive

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,280
it's not competitive advantage or

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,270
anything else it's nothing

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,130
differentiating about it I described the

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,600
model so you'll notice that there's two

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,730
other figis there's composite and

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,110
there's global identifier the composite

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,450
IBM's traded across the world on

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,290
multiple exchanges within the US 15 or

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,240
so exchanges so this the one ends in 16

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,700
is just the New York Stock Exchange

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,370
there's 14 other ones all of them

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,740
reference this composite which is a

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,170
composite for the US so it's specific

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,210
just for the US on par with Cusick which

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,220
would sell at DTC say but you can

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,490
associate all those 15 exchanges and

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,160
roll them up now that same dynamic works

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,780
across world there's five exchanges in

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,270
Germany there's exchange in the UK

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,070
Europe whatnot and they all have their

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,780
own composite by jurisdiction they all

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,670
roll up to the global level so you're

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:13,360
able to form a data model and associate

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,640
all these things and preserve your other

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,450
legacy identifiers mapping and metadata

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,520
associated great customer response of

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,410
course just like we talked about earlier

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,030
in the day at other presentations

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,420
everybody's always worried about lock-in

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,390
is Bloomberg gonna pull this back after

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,700
it's been open and free general distrust

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,590
of vendors we have the whole data

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,230
problem with the exchanges that's going

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:42,090
on today

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:44,790
so much like NEMA announced this morning

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,310
about alloy being provided out and

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,110
decoupling it from Goldman we did that

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,640
10 years ago was Figgy we went to the

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,180
object Management Group which is a

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,670
technical standards consortium who has a

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,400
lot of good experience in Open Data

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:02,310
Corbis standard UML other things and we

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,290
gave them the standard went through

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,600
their standardization process we had

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,570
already given an out underneath the MIT

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,860
open source but that was actually baked

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:19,920
in the standard when we went through the

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:23,580
translation process with omj yes other

00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,220
questions today about it the in asthma

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,650
right now they're looking at the

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:32,790
charging that exchanges have you can

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:35,970
look up the news around it that answer

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,070
your question yeah there's just you lock

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,930
in control charging all that kind of

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:44,870
things so open data helps solve some of

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:49,290
that problem what we offer out is a

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:52,500
Figgy open figure comm anybody can

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:55,260
access this this is got all the data

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,220
it's associated with Figgy 650 million

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:02,880
objects that includes inactive and

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,620
active securities there's two JSON API s

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,910
anybody can write to you know have to be

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,520
Bloomberg user you don't have to

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,700
register on the website you pull the

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:18,300
stuff from github hit the API and you'll

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:22,260
be able to access this data now open

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:26,370
source versus open data

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,660
I say it's easier now to talk about open

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:33,840
source and have a proposition against it

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,020
codes demonstrable yeah the github you

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,580
can register and github and as we've

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,670
heard all through today as well as

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,040
previous presentations over the years

00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,980
people are getting behind open source

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,960
problem with data and open data is

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,970
there's no github data first of all and

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,970
a lot of talk around data

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,360
days is dinners new oil it is new water

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,640
so a lot of value is being attached to

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,350
data no matter what it is and there's

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,670
need to differentiate that right there

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,380
is core reference information that is

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,290
just description everybody has it

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:13,350
so why is that differentiator it's not

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,590
this is the list of fields actually from

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:20,700
the terminal that if you go fields open

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:22,800
symbology that's it that's everything we

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,670
offer open it's all descriptive fields

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,450
name description security type simple

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:33,150
things right differentiating this is a

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,180
description field and in the terminal

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,610
you have you know all your your price

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:45,480
information get a date market values

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:50,280
caps and all that kind of thing there we

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:53,040
go so as a firm that's gonna be looking

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,240
at open data and offering open data what

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,410
are the challenges you're going to have

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,760
starting out right just like open source

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,230
folks are going to worry about

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,660
cannibalization are you giving things

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,770
away for free there is a cost to this

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,480
but as Russell had mentioned earlier

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,930
there's cost savings in working with

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,170
open source same as open data are you

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,990
giving a competitive advantage away if

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,190
it's core foundational data there's no

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,380
competitive advantage in that it's

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,420
commoditized everybody should be working

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:29,640
off the same foundation that's where you

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:32,150
start creating differentiation next

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,260
today

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,310
once you've already made these arguments

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,960
and you have this process going

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,970
something's always going to come back

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,250
and say well why are we doing that ok

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,690
it's very successful let's let's do

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,640
something else with it so you have to

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,370
state of course and you always have to

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:53,430
continue to revise and renew your value

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:54,750
proposition as things become more

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,660
commoditized you want to look at maybe

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,040
expanding that set so you always have

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,830
the argument is a cannibalization of

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,499
current services or is it more valuable

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,759
to the industry as open source

00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:10,909
the open data and there's still cost you

00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,429
always have to justify the cost

00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:16,169
qualitatively you know it's easy to

00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:18,809
dismiss that if you can't have those

00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,489
proper metrics quantitative is really

00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:26,719
hard to prove when you're giving things

00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:29,249
away but when we come down to it

00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:31,109
benefits mutual clients clients are

00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:33,599
gonna buy data from multiple sources why

00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:36,439
make it hard for them to compare by

00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:40,799
making it easy to compare across sources

00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:43,079
through open data the value you really

00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,309
get to say who is the better prices

00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,149
who's better corporate action

00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:49,469
information who gives me better service

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:54,509
these are the things are differentiating

00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:57,599
not description benefit to the industry

00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,819
you're lowering barriers to entry I

00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:03,449
don't know how many startups I've met

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:04,709
FinTech firms that I saw present at a

00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,179
conference I want to talk to him about

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,919
Figgy and they said oh yeah we already

00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,929
know about Figgy we use it that's how we

00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,589
started our business from like in

00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:15,720
trinium a date of vendor out of Florida

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,599
they use Figgy

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,819
and it's what enabled them to create and

00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:23,489
reference data set to build the business

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:26,189
office lowering Bennett entries

00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:28,559
increasing competition forces you to

00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:30,619
increase quality and just makes it

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,419
better for the industry overall

00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:34,799
internally you know you're gonna look at

00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,349
you're not gonna have to focus on that

00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,629
core reference anymore

00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:41,999
because it's shared now you can focus on

00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,099
what are new products I can have where

00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:46,379
can I interoperate with other service

00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:50,849
providers to provide more value for

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:54,239
clients and I think it was Sherman this

00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:56,459
morning mentioned that open source is a

00:12:54,239 --> 00:13:02,759
net positive for your reputation doing

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:04,739
good is always doing good so externally

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,319
whether the challenges come up against

00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:09,479
well for us Bloomberg you know market

00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:13,289
leader you're always going to be point

00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:14,699
of that but again then it was an object

00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,549
management group we gave to the weight

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,750
to them still people say oh well you're

00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,440
Bloomberg

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:24,840
you have to have that conversation

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,690
competitors can you get competitors to

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,330
cooperate I know the previous present

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,080
presenter talked about his organization

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,760
that looks to create co-op petition and

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,060
those kind of organizations are very

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,860
useful for bringing people together to

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:44,520
solve problems they're shared across the

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,110
industry and ten years ago there's

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,400
confusion around that you know data was

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,990
just something you stored an Oracle or

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,350
Sybase who really cared about

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,700
associations and data models and a lot

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:59,130
of that kind of thing especially from

00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:02,130
the business end today still you know

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,600
you should still get where you can't

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,840
apologize for being market leader and

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,650
living value but we are working with the

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:13,470
industry we work with US standards and

00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:16,020
organizations we I so an object

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:20,280
management group to forward clauses of

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:22,920
open data competitors and other vendors

00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,280
we have over 150 vendors that have

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,800
adopted Figgy have it in their feeds

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,730
setting up their clients exchanges use

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,620
it assign it on issuance there's a page

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,960
on the open Figgy site you can check out

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,400
the facilitators that we have there some

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:45,030
are still on the sidelines hoping they

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:47,100
join up as well but one point of success

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,970
is that users know what more to free

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,490
more for free so you still have to look

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,200
at and say you know what there's a

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,420
differentiated value here and you have

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,960
to be able to explain that use case to

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:05,760
the users so the reality is competitions

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:12,510
good choice enables and helps the

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:14,250
industry the other thing is lock-in why

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,440
compete on lock-in when you compete on

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:21,270
quality that's where the value is for

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,650
your firm in delivering to clients and

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,350
also for the industry and the clients

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,840
receiving the data you do have to

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:31,860
address the slowly slowly sliding scale

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,930
where this is as things become

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,120
monetised you should be focusing on

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,860
things that create more value create

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,410
more value on the other end expand that

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,779
value proposition here and as things

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,910
monetize you can open those things up

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:48,779
for open data and add it to add it to

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,690
what you're offering there's value in

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,670
services a Linux is free

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,190
Red Hat provides services on top of that

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,019
make it easy for you so those are the

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,880
things that have value add on top of

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:06,720
open problem is people are jumping on

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,209
the bandwagon in this use of open lots

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,829
of standards organizations out there

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:14,310
just because it's standard doesn't mean

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,899
that's open even you can't qualified by

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,329
a standards organization so somebody

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,860
like I so just because it's ISO doesn't

00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:23,120
mean it's open doesn't mean it's not

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,519
open so 22 22 as mentioned in previous

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:31,079
discussions well swift in its management

00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:34,160
of 2020 to open a bunch of other

00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:37,529
standards within that TC 68 are not

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:43,860
others are so currency code country code

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:47,279
those are open when you assume a

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,290
standard is open and it's not you can

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,390
get locked in because of licensing

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,430
restrictions cost recovery and Rand

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,380
reasonable and non-discriminatory are

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,620
not audited by any standards

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:04,490
organization that allows it I know of

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:09,480
cases of 200% markup under standard so

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:12,059
being aware of that proprietary is used

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,250
as a derogatory term a lot of times but

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,850
there's a lot of proprietary things out

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:21,000
there that are actually standards open

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:23,339
and have a large community on them FP ml

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,290
and fix some people keep on calling them

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,530
proprietary they're not there are

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:31,350
community based standards providers

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,100
sometimes misuse open in order to get on

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,429
the bandwagon

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,290
so looking at how they operate that's

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,510
important to look at sometimes they'll

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,990
say you can use the identifier but you

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,410
have to buy the description or after 500

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,270
uses

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,990
Dungey's start Regina

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,120
or you can use it but you have to buy it

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,820
as part of this bundle that to me is not

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,420
open data open data is you can go

00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:00,660
somewhere do a search get api's get real

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,760
data in a work flow without having to do

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:10,970
screen scrapes or anything else or pay a

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:12,929
license fee regulators are helpful and

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,830
still need some education

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:18,390
like I said standards regulators have

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,910
bought in standards they both bought

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,940
into open they're confused still about

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:29,040
that difference between standards

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,240
doesn't mean open buy mandates they're

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,200
trying to get people adopt standards

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,150
which is a good thing in theory but if

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,400
you mandate something that creates

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,380
lock-in especially if there's licensing

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,200
and restrictions around that standard

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,870
now you have created a regulatory pulse

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,550
monopoly which is not good for the

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,690
industry it's not good for innovation

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,800
creates friction marketplace and

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:59,760
introduces a high level cost to the

00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:02,900
market one of the reasons so burn on his

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,250
talk about c++ this morning mentioned

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,190
everybody wants to make c++ more simple

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,820
I can't right that's just silly

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,960
but you can try and organize it

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,179
regulators are facing the same sort of

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,000
challenge with financial services where

00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,610
they are financial services is actually

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
complex and they're thinking oh well

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,830
we'll standardize it now get rid of

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,480
complexity no because different

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,790
communities speak different languages

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,679
and you can't standardize away

00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,840
complexity you can organize it but you

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,360
can't stand the eyes of the way fixed

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,850
income desk equity desk to different

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,250
languages sure they have some overlap in

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,179
some things but they definitely have

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,120
different cultures and different

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,980
languages at this peak so you have to

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,610
look at creating standards specific to

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:53,030
communities and allow choice and

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,030
openness

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,980
great thing about standards is that

00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,430
there's so many that's always a great

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,370
line usually set with division I think

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:05,440
it's a good thing if you look at

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,940
standards and when people say these

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,060
stands were competing with each other I

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,620
would posit that they are not they are

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,770
likely built for different communities

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,260
that different needs they're similar but

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,580
they're different that's where I go the

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,080
silos are not a bad thing

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,080
silos are a naturally occurring

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,280
phenomenon they are shared culture

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,410
shared process

00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,150
that's why silos exist because they have

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,400
a shared culture and share process you

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,160
gain efficiencies out of that you should

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,990
look at focusing your standards on those

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,850
silos and then figure out how to

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,170
interoperate between the silos not

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,660
collapse them I don't know how many

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,840
efforts I've been through where fixed

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,400
income and equity or merged together or

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,620
global custody and domestic custody were

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,180
merged together and two three years

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,420
later they're ripped back apart because

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,790
it didn't work because everybody's

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,920
looking for a silver bullet silver

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:01,600
bullets only kill werewolves not

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:03,850
vampires right you need the solution for

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,190
the community dealing with one thing is

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,270
not going to solve all your problems

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,960
people need to understand this in

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:14,710
standards standard does not mean

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,430
homogenizing across everything standards

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,630
use prevent competition through lock-in

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,640
someone owns a standard and they've

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,040
licensing and they can charge for it

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,670
they convince the regulator's that oh

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,020
we're a standard it gets mandated now

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,490
the industry stuck with that and they

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,760
can't use anything else they don't have

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:36,060
choice they can't innovate and they've

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,060
cost

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:44,920
so in closing open data I don't think is

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:49,450
that risk yet however there's things we

00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:52,270
need to think about opened and public

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:56,320
sector is coming under fire you see open

00:21:52,270 --> 00:22:00,390
data from the government closing up open

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,390
data in private sector it's difficult

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:06,000
open data just like open source has to

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,290
start with the market leaders

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,870
but there's some distrust market leaders

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,500
I think those Russell also said that

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,090
without community open-source will die

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,100
so that's what we're looking for in open

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,820
data is more people to join the

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,570
community and support these efforts you

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,510
prevent lock-in you create innovation

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:33,450
you lower barriers to entry for new

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:35,520
firms individuals programmers that need

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,700
access to data in order to do their work

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,710
and come up with innovative ideas and

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,400
every community is different so

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,560
embracing standards and differences and

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,560
not standardizing or trying to modernize

00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,700
everybody but embrace those differences

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,490
adopt standards appropriate for those

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,050
communities and make them interoperate

00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:01,500
together don't make them all like the

00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:03,420
same now if two minutes or so left I

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:13,230
promised Jim Northey who's next that I

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:18,000
wouldn't run over on him no yeah I mean

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,650
you you'll see open datasets and if the

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,780
government's budget doesn't support it

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:25,380
then you know it's not gonna stay out

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,830
there right that's not just in the US

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,280
I'm just talking globally that budgetary

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,760
pressure is everything else it's our

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,140
money that funds it as taxes but that

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,960
gets allocated somewhere else if oh I

00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:46,080
don't think so III think it's priority

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,790
right if other priorities are seen and

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,040
the value of open data is not understood

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,860
which right now I don't think it is

00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,770
understood within financial services or

00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:02,010
even globally I mean I'm a surfer I love

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:04,110
NOAA because ain't based on those data I

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,390
can go and find forecasts for when I

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,880
need to go and especially being in

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,070
Jersey it it's very variable

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,150
but using NOAA data you can find out

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:17,600
right if that wasn't available it's not

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,890
just for me it's for shipping shipments

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,450
logistics everything else depend

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,250
on that and if we don't keep sight of

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:36,360
that then you can lose some of these

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:40,230
open data sources let that well it's I

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:47,070
would say you can't move off of legacy

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:49,710
identifiers completely well so there are

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,990
particular legacy systems and everything

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,570
else not looking at eliminating anything

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,960
but making it more sensible for when you

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,910
should use something how you want to

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,200
move off it it depends on how are you

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,410
going to work on your infrastructure

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,210
it's a lot of implementation

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,160
Figgy helps you navigate between the

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,110
different identifiers that are there so

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,960
hopefully offering a little bit more

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:18,270
choice around what you can use and if

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,610
regulatory regimes industry

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,740
infrastructure and whatnot also adopt a

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,970
choice then you have the choice to pick

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,400
what works for you right I come from a

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,940
custodian Bank background back stressed

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,570
back in New York

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,370
and yep I love sedol because you know I

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,180
could determine which jurisdiction and

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,180
place the settlement

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,429
actually it's so Bloomberg does support

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:55,890
of open data in entity we are a ello you

00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:57,990
legal op local operating unit for the le

00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:01,710
I the legal entity identifier front

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,470
which is ISO standard and so we offer

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:16,500
that out through the association with

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:19,559
the gly fun our Lau website yeah I

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,080
understand we want to support the the

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,700
industry's efforts around legal entity

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,890
and as an open data standard le I has

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,529
potential there so we will I mean we're

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,779
making a lot of efforts in especially in

00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:41,480
Asia and other markets where you haven't

00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:44,850
had as much take up oh yeah I'm over so

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,210
thank you very much and enjoy the rest

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,210
of the conference

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:56,180
