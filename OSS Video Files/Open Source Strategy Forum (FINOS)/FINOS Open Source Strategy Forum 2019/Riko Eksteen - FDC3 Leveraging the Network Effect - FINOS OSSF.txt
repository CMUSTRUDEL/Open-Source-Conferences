RIKO EKSTEEN | "FDC3 LEVERAGING THE NETWORK EFFECT" | FINOS OSSF 2019

►► View Riko's talk on the FINOS.org website here: https://www.finos.org/ossf-2019-speaker-riko-eksteen

The Network Effect has been a key differentiator for creating value in the technology industry. Microservice architectures use this to great effect to establish decoupled services, connected through the HTTP standard for communication. Micro-frontends are applying the same patterns to help componentize our financial desktops, to achieve similar benefits. However, so far how to link applications together to create networks has not been as clear.
 
The FDC3 communication standard for financial desktops aims to establish a community-driven way to link front-end components together. During this talk, we will examine why looking to leverage the network effect for our financial desktops is so important, and how the open FDC3 standard can help us to do this.

[Music]

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,670
good afternoon everyone I hope you had a

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:25,019
you had a great lunch and yeah it feels

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,240
very surreal to stand in a on stage in a

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,070
real theater in Broadway it's not

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,960
something I ever imagined myself doing

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:38,399
but let's see how it goes I'm going to

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,100
start by Who I am as some of you here

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,899
know me a lot of you don't I think I've

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,600
put a picture up there for you for those

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,160
of you who can't see me very well

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,120
the first thing that you will notice

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,940
that I don't really look like that I

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,199
think there was a lot of photoshop

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,190
involved in that picture

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,160
the second thing you'll notice is that

00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,979
that is not a picture of be honest true

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,500
stripped the inventor of C++ he is

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,890
speaking right now at the same time

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,049
stage three so if you're in the wrong

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,340
talk I'll give you a quick moment to

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:24,900
just you know leave and go to his talk

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:29,430
anyone can I go yeah so I'm glad all of

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,420
you stayed so just a little bit about

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,290
myself I I come from Cape Town in South

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:41,750
Africa I've been working in the

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:46,200
financial industry for 15 plus years I I

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,970
now live and work in London and I've

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,869
done everything from Delfy and ASP

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,659
through WPF and flash to html5 and react

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,369
nowadays can I can I just see any any

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:06,180
Delfy anyone who did Delfy in the room

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:08,849
yeah those were the good old days yeah I

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,280
now work at adaptive financial

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,650
consulting in London where I've been for

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,349
about five years and I'm the head

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,670
of desktop strategy there and through my

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,349
time at adaptive I worked at on several

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,750
industry-leading desktop platforms for

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,110
Tier one banks and and other

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,069
organizations including Deutsche Bank's

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:36,299
Autobahn platform and I advise clients

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,970
on on desktop technologies collaboration

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:41,220
and workflow and and how they can

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,159
extract the most value out of that for

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,010
their organizations and through doing

00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,310
that I became involved in finis and more

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,829
specifically FDC 3 and are now a program

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,280
management committee member for FTC 3

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:58,680
program and the chair of FDC threes API

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,530
working group and I'll say a little bit

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,569
more about if there's a FTC 3 later in

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:09,629
the talk but enough about me let's talk

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,659
about what's really important I think

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:15,689
all of us hopefully can say that what we

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:19,349
want to do is create value for the

00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:22,049
organizations that we work for and I got

00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:29,329
this quote from a from a VCE group

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:32,250
called nfx who specializes in in

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:34,680
startups and companies with net network

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,709
effects and they said that over the past

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,709
23 years network effects have accounted

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:44,879
for approximately 70% of the value a

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:49,409
value creation in technology and the

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,239
study looked at 336 companies from 1994

00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:57,180
pretty much to today with evaluation

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,849
over a billion dollars and it estimated

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,280
that about 35% of those companies had

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:06,629
Network effects that they call leading

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,359
to 70% of the value created by those

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,430
companies and their conclusion was that

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:15,409
network effects have an asymmetric

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,699
upside network effects are what allows

00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:20,459
companies to punch above their weights

00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,980
for the Davids to take on the Goliath

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,440
and this study says that

00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,470
the single most predictable attribute of

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,070
the highest value tech companies is

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,740
leveraging network effects so what does

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:40,580
network effects mean it's not actually

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,470
very complicated I think most of us here

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,710
will know that a network is made up of

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,480
nodes and links between those nodes the

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,670
nodes or the network participants and

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,860
the links or the connections between the

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,780
nodes you can have a high density

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,000
network with lots of links between the

00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:00,260
nodes you can have a lower density

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,670
Network you can have nodes that are more

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,150
important than others links that are

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,800
more important than others but you link

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:11,150
all of these pieces together to create

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,190
value and what network effects referred

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,340
to is that basically depending on the

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,920
characteristics of your network it

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,500
starts to scale exponentially in value

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,420
as you connect more pieces together as

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,360
you add more nodes to your network as

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,180
you link more of your nodes together you

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,740
start to see an upside which is more

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,300
than just the individual pieces that

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,330
you're putting into your network and

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:39,170
that is a very powerful effect which

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,610
scales exponentially over time and you

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,330
get a graph which looks a little bit

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,950
like this so originally the network is

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,750
sort of flat or the value that the

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,970
network creates is sort of flat as

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,980
you're putting the pieces in place but

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:56,480
once you reach a certain critical mass

00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:00,080
it really starts to take off and the

00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,770
value that the network provides scales

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,350
up almost with the ability to just sit

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,820
back and and watch as the value

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,500
accumulates from the pieces you've

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,530
already put in place on each new piece

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,990
that you add to the network and there

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,140
are many different types of networks

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,390
physical networks like phone Protocol

00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,720
networks platforms data markets and

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,700
they've all got slightly different color

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,830
characteristics and a slightly different

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,960
point where they reach critical mass for

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,820
some it is earlier for for some it is

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,970
later but the important point is

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,320
reaching that stage where you get

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,540
critical mass and you start to see the

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,220
value that the network

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:45,160
brings to you now one way that in the

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,410
technology industry we've tried to

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,660
create lightweight nodes to easily put

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,660
nodes in place that you can build a

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,620
network with is through micro services

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,290
and each micro service which is like a

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,130
standalone piece of functionality

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:04,540
effectively form the nodes in your

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,100
network and you then connect these nodes

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,310
together with standardized communication

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:13,810
in the case of micro services it's

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,980
typically HTTP and I can't stress enough

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:22,210
I think how important HTTP which is an

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:24,610
open standard a protocol has meant for

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,650
the adoption of micro services I think

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,780
if it wasn't for that it wouldn't have

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,690
seen the take up that it has gotten and

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,120
the success that it has had and why

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,770
using the micro service nodes and the

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,990
standardized communication between them

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,430
together it allows systems to be broken

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,650
down into smaller parts and there's lots

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,460
of continued innovation in this area as

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,880
we all know docker cloud open API the

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,190
list goes on but it all comes back down

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,050
to these lightweight nodes which are

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,700
quite simple to create and the

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,040
standardized communication patterns

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,370
between them that are easy for people to

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,140
adopt and this type of decoupled

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,740
architecture brings a lot of advantages

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,510
that we've seen in the industry

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,360
now each lightweight node each micro

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,030
service has high maintainability and

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,390
testability on its own I've mentioned

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,670
the standardized communication patterns

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:24,160
that allow them to be easily connected

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:27,190
and each piece in the network is

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,440
independently deployable so you no

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,480
longer have to deploy the whole system

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,120
together you can deploy them on

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:39,460
independent schedules you can build them

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,020
with different teams and it allows the

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,669
nodes in your network or the micro

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,229
services to be augur are organized

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,450
around business capabilities you can

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,250
have a team responsible for building the

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,320
analytic service or the pricing service

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,160
and that service can then be used in

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,129
multiple places

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,500
so you avoid duplication in that way and

00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:00,310
it allows small autonomous teams that

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,079
are responsible for individual services

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,389
or sets of services to work

00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,610
independently from each other and

00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,439
release things at different times and

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,899
then they connected together through the

00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:14,800
standards for me one of the biggest

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:16,720
advantages is that it allows evolution

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,670
of your technology stack you no longer

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,149
have a big monolithic systems that you

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:25,089
have to bring up to date all in one go

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:28,050
which is costly and I'm very painful you

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:32,079
can if you break it down enough you can

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,910
transfer original individual nodes to

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,860
new technologies or put new ones in

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,379
place using new technologies without

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,430
affecting the rest of the system because

00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,660
they're all still using those

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,790
standardized communication patterns and

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,000
if we wanted to demonstrate this in a

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,100
diet in a diagrammatic manner you know

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,519
when you start a project with a small

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,290
team and for a long time in our industry

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,930
you know typically you you build things

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,819
as a monolith one application with one

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,319
team that does the front end the back

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,209
end the database everything else

00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:06,160
together in one go and there's a lot of

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:09,639
advantages to that it's easy to deploy

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,470
it's one code base but our systems

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,019
become more complex as the amount of

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,569
people that work on a system becomes

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:19,029
more complex the first thing that

00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,130
happened is system started to be divided

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,569
into client-server boundaries right so

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,490
you have your front-end team working on

00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:27,699
the front-end the back-end team working

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:32,279
on the backend and that allowed a bit of

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:36,130
differentiation and maybe the ability to

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,899
slightly at different times develop

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,750
those two pieces in different ways and

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,550
with the advent of micro services you

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,970
know the back-end could then be split up

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,069
into individual smaller components like

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,259
you know your pricing service or your

00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:51,970
analytic service which are then

00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,160
aggregated together and used by the

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,819
front-end but the interesting thing to

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,130
me about this picture is that the

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,829
front-end here is still monolithic it's

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,570
still one front-end built by one team

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,790
that use all of these service

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,280
so you don't really get the benefits

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,100
that we've talked about that exists on

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:16,500
the back end if if you build it in this

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,730
way so where things on our going is that

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,530
people are starting to talk about micro

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:25,630
front ends so you know whether that

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,760
means web components whether it means a

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,190
widget running on your desktop inside a

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,990
container like electron you have the

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,210
ability to build smaller front-end

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,130
components that you can then compose

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,140
together they might still go all into

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,990
one window but it gives you the ability

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,990
to also run them separately and combine

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,700
them as you want with really all of the

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,680
same advantages that we get on the

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:52,150
backend the independent deployability

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,220
smaller teams evolution of Technology if

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,650
you've got a big WPF application that

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,060
you want to migrate it's very hard to do

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,280
but if you start breaking it into

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,350
smaller pieces and you migrated one

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,330
pieces of time that works much better

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,310
but for me really the true promise and

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,500
where we can leverage network effects

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,870
comes when you can now take each of

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,270
those applications or micro front-end

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,820
pieces and start connecting them

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,080
together into a network and this is

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,070
something that a lot of people have not

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,320
spoken about yet how do you you building

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,970
these individual micro front ends but

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,890
how do you link them together in the

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,490
same way that you link micro services

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,920
together with HTTP because if you want

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,520
to build a front-end network from a

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,220
componentize desktop you know enabled by

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,440
the modern technologies that that we've

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,820
mentioned how do you define the

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,000
communication links between those

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,240
applications can we do it in a simple

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,070
standardized way inside our organization

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,080
but also that spans organizations

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,480
because ultimately we want what we want

00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,420
to do is leverage the network effect if

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,030
we can do it in the same way using

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,280
lightweight nodes with simple

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,110
standardized communication then it

00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,750
becomes easy to drop those nodes into

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:15,430
place and to scale out over time and get

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:18,660
that asymmetric upside and this is where

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:22,510
FDC 3 comes in

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,060
dc3 Christ to establish open standards

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,010
for the financial desktop to allow those

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,080
micro front-ends to communicate with

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,230
each other to connect the nodes in your

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,090
network together FDC 3 stands for the

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,910
financial desktop connectivity and

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:40,900
collaboration consortium it was started

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:44,350
by by open fin a financial desktop

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,890
platform in in 2017 were also a furnace

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:52,060
member and they contributed it to finis

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:54,190
and the FTC 31.0 specifications were

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,880
released in March of this year and many

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:02,170
firms are now starting to use them on

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,150
their desktops to leverage connections

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,100
between their applications if you want

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,620
to read more about FTC 3 then what I say

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,100
here today please go to FTC 3 don't

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,710
finish the dog which explains it all

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,110
hopefully in an understandable way so

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,980
what are the standards at FTC 3 try to

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,530
put in place well firstly you need a way

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,140
to address applications to discover

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,690
applications so that you can connect

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,900
them together and people have tried

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,340
building app stores or up directories

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,110
each in their own way but if we can

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,930
standardize that and all do it in the

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,570
same way then we can find applications

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:44,950
in the same way and hopefully connect

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:47,650
them together another central piece of

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:52,900
of FTC 3 is their intense specification

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:55,020
and intense are a relatively simple

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,670
concept they're basically a way to

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,290
define capabilities that applications

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,540
have that they can publish in the App

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:05,290
Store which other applications can

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:09,310
leverage fd3 itself tries to standardize

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:11,170
some common intents an example might be

00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,080
a star chat intent and one application

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:17,890
might say it wants to start a chat it

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,850
doesn't care about which application

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,890
starts the chat but it wants to transfer

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,380
the interaction to that application and

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:29,050
that's where intense come into play via

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,790
chart would be another example and if

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,190
you know a bit of mobile development in

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,230
and really a new concept Android has

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,450
intense when you go from your calendar

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,000
up with the location to your map app

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,440
maps up that's using an intent to

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,170
connect the app apps together but what

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,510
goes hand-in-hand with that is how do

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,880
you talk about the data that the

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,700
applications need to communicate with

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:59,260
each other if you have a star chat

00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:02,530
intent how do you describe the the

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,480
contact or the customer that you that

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,550
you want to start a chat with if you

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,280
want to display a chart with a via chart

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:12,340
intent how do you represent the

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,130
instrument that you want to display the

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:20,860
chart for and FDC 3 defines a

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,210
standardized way to describe those data

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,840
payloads that can be used across

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:28,300
applications across the industry and we

00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,010
we work hand-in-hand with the financial

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,940
object standardization group in fairness

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:36,160
to help talk about financial objects in

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,640
a standardized way when we're connecting

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,690
applications together it turns out that

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,610
contextual data is also very useful for

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,090
sharing just sharing context between

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,890
applications if I select a blotter o in

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,140
this application my other application

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,260
can respond in kind because we both know

00:16:53,140 --> 00:17:01,210
what data we're talking about

00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:03,160
and finally API a very simple shared set

00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,830
of operations with a low barrier to

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,290
entry that everybody can use to connect

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,970
the pieces together this is all

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,730
underpinned by the use case working

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,260
group which looks at what financial use

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,940
cases we're trying to solve with the

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,420
standards and how we can fill the gaps

00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,880
between applications so let me

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:25,240
illustrate it with a very simple example

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,910
to try and make it practical let's say

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,160
you have an alerting application that

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,710
shows a notification when a trade was

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,390
executed and from that application you

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,190
want to start a conversation with the

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,620
customer so you can click on the

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,440
notification and it takes you to the

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,540
chat app that knows who the customer is

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,160
that automatically launches the chat app

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,380
that initiates a condom

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,270
maybe with some context about the trade

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,920
that you want to talk about and it all

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,480
happens automatically with a single

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,730
click from the user because the

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,360
applications are connected together from

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,820
there you might want to provide a price

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,630
to the customer and it would then

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,030
transfer into the application that

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,950
performs the pricing now the key thing

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,020
is these are all micro front-ends built

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,610
by different teams independently of one

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,920
another but they use the standardized

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,600
communication to be linked together and

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,420
what you will see here is that we've

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,380
created a network with three nodes and

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,320
two links and this is where the network

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,810
effect comes in because now you can put

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,600
another application in place add two

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:34,230
more links and over time the amount of

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,340
things you link together

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,540
exponentially increases and the value

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:44,220
you get out of your system is has that

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:49,120
asymmetric upside that we're looking for

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,650
so in summary I've talked about how

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,730
network effects are critical for

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:58,270
unlocking value micro services are

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:00,820
effectively decoupled HTTP link nodes

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,610
and I kind of want to expand the

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,700
definition of micro front-ends a bit too

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:09,060
not just applications that you put on

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,380
your desktop but actually linked

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,600
applications that you can put on your

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,730
desktop and an emerging standard that

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,190
we're trying to create for that is FTC 3

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:22,120
it allows us to link applications

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,300
together so by doing this we can

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,790
leverage the network's effects and it

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,430
turns out open connected applications

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,890
are both powerful inside an individual

00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,170
organization but also across our

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,300
industry applications from multiple

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,070
vendors from the buy side from the sell

00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,870
side can all come together to create

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,780
value for our customers and benefit

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:48,130
everyone and that is the promise of FTC

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:51,430
3 and the promise of network effects so

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,410
yeah that is all I have for today we

00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:56,200
still have a few minutes left so if

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:59,280
anyone has any questions then I'd be

00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,280
happy to answer them

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,880
[Applause]

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,140
anyone I can't see the hands very well

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,140
hi yes over there

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,180
yeah that's a great question it's

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,490
something we've we've talked about a lot

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,010
recently in the FCC three working groups

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,190
in the community is how can we extend

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,570
the value proposition how we can we can

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,670
we make that connection

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,060
maybe with HTTP that a lot of people are

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,800
already comfortable using there's some

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,770
challenges to doing that in a desktop

00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,050
environment that we need to solve but I

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,460
think if we want to truly leverage those

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,910
effects that's something we have to

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,910
think about

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,750
yeah the question is if we're reaching

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,660
out to other parts of the of the

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,850
community to to bring more people on

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,100
board with this way of working and I

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,800
think that's that's the true promise of

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,840
such an approach right the more people

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,940
we can get involved the better we can

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,050
expand the network and get the value out

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,560
of it

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,480
I mentioned that we work closely with

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,520
the financial objects group that are

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,420
trying to define standardized ways to

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,060
talk about orders and trades and various

00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,250
financial products in a standard way

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,230
across the industry so we're trying to

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:27,570
mirror our contracts on that but it

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:31,170
really is a concept that spans across

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:35,010
just one single desktop or across or

00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:38,910
beyond financial services so it is just

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,500
in its infancy but but we will see we

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,660
want to see where we can take this and I

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,890
think it's very heartening that the

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,080
whole industry is coming together

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,700
recognizing that this is a shared

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,040
problem and that we can all help each

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,600
other and that it's done being done in

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,960
the open in the community yeah yeah

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,960
hello

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:10,860
sorry I can't hear very well can you

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:12,630
speak up a bit yes yes the whole you

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,120
know just like I should appear or any

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,570
other standard it falls down a bit if it

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,510
isn't agnostic and and what FTC 3 is

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,550
doing is trying to do is really trying

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,780
to uplift an abstract patterns that

00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,410
people have been using for a while

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,850
building financial desktop applications

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,160
you know using some of the vendor

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,140
products people have been connecting

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,210
applications together but in

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,280
non-standard way so we're trying to

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,520
standardize those ways so that they are

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:44,880
agnostic of who is involved you know and

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:50,520
and we've got people from organizations

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:54,120
like Thomson Reuters IH I HS market

00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,070
coming to the FTC three sessions being

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,990
involved in the community in the process

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:13,860
so we're trying to make it as broad as

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:15,840
possible to to achieve that we are quite

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,940
careful that we don't want to provide a

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,820
platform because then you lose a bit of

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,470
their open standard nature so we're

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,330
trying to create standards and then

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,760
people can try and implement them in

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,070
their platforms and feedback what they

00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,110
find and then we bring the standards

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,140
further along you know so we have

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,730
samples of usage we have some of the

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,180
members of FTC three who build

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:46,640
applications that that demonstrate how

00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:46,640
it can be used one last question

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,280
yeah I I think that is something that

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:16,950
has come up at the moment it's

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,750
relatively point-to-point but you know

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,000
if if you want to help us explore that

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,460
get involved in the community we'd love

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,830
to get proposals from people and

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,630
continue that discussion because that is

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:35,660
definitely something that we want to

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:35,660
consider I'm slightly over but just one

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:58,630
yeah the the reason why the registration

00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,250
is upfront is because it allows the

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,610
application to be launched on demand if

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,500
it isn't running right but I know some

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:08,560
of the vendors who have implemented FCC

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,450
3 have added dynamic registration to it

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,150
so it is available it isn't in the

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,860
standard currently and the approach I

00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,380
think we're trying to follow now is if

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,900
you imagine how the the browser vendors

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,790
work they run ahead of the standards and

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,620
try things out and then eventually the

00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,200
things come back into the standard and

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,570
and become standardized across everyone

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,550
um so I think that's what we're trying

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,500
to do now because this value in people

00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:37,630
experimenting and finding out the best

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:39,130
way to do things cool thank you very

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,820
much everyone for attending really

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,820
appreciate it
