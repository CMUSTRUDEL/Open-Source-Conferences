RIKO EKSTEEN | "FDC3 LEVERAGING THE NETWORK EFFECT" | FINOS OSSF 2019

The Network Effect has been a key differentiator for creating value in the technology industry. Microservice architectures use this to great effect to establish decoupled services, connected through the HTTP standard for communication. Micro-frontends are applying the same patterns to help componentize our financial desktops, to achieve similar benefits. However, so far how to link applications together to create networks has not been as clear.
 
The FDC3 communication standard for financial desktops aims to establish a community-driven way to link front-end components together. During this talk, we will examine why looking to leverage the network effect for our financial desktops is so important, and how the open FDC3 standard can help us to do this.
