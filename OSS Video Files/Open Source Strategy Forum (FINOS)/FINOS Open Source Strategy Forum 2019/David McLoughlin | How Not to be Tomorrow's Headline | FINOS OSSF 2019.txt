David McLoughlin, Director, Solutions Engineering, Flexera

The financial industry is full speed ahead using open source to innovate and drive real value for customers. The pace of technological change is forcing disruption, and business leaders have to adapt to keep up. Open source enables organizations to spread their wings, explore, and easily scale solutions that will drive true competitive advantage. But, in the words of Spiderman’s uncle, “With great power comes great responsibility.” The data speaks for itself. Companies are aware of less than 10% of the actual open source being used in applications and products potentially shipping to customers and third parties, leading to potential legal and security issues. Additionally, customers today are more savvy and expect higher levels of compliance. What is your role in managing compliance and security vulnerabilities associated with open source software? Join David McLoughlin, Director of Solution Engineering at Flexera, as he explores the real and immediate need for users of open source to understand the potential security and legal obligations associated with open source. David will address:

- How not be in the next news cycle
- Open source management relative to due diligence efforts (M&A)
- A walk through the most common open source licenses
- How to work effectively and securely with open source software both as a consumer of someone else’s work and as a creator
- Trends in open source license enforcement
- What real compliance looks like
