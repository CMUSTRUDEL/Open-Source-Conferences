	David McLoughlin | Flexera | How Not to be Tomorrow's Headline | FINOS OSSF 2019

David McLoughlin, Director, Solutions Engineering, Flexera

The financial industry is full speed ahead using open source to innovate and drive real value for customers. The pace of technological change is forcing disruption, and business leaders have to adapt to keep up. Open source enables organizations to spread their wings, explore, and easily scale solutions that will drive true competitive advantage. But, in the words of Spiderman’s uncle, “With great power comes great responsibility.” The data speaks for itself. Companies are aware of less than 10% of the actual open source being used in applications and products potentially shipping to customers and third parties, leading to potential legal and security issues. Additionally, customers today are more savvy and expect higher levels of compliance. What is your role in managing compliance and security vulnerabilities associated with open source software? Join David McLoughlin, Director of Solution Engineering at Flexera, as he explores the real and immediate need for users of open source to understand the potential security and legal obligations associated with open source. David will address:

- How not be in the next news cycle
- Open source management relative to due diligence efforts (M&A)
- A walk through the most common open source licenses
- How to work effectively and securely with open source software both as a consumer of someone else’s work and as a creator
- Trends in open source license enforcement
- What real compliance looks like

[Music]

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,080
all right

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
thank you very much i just wanted to

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,439
start out by uh thanking you all for

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,480
joining me this afternoon

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,160
and uh thank you for uh thanos for

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,080
inviting us to to talk um

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,519
if you were just here for ibrahim's

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,679
presentation

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,280
uh he told me that he had planned on 45

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,079
minutes

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
and uh i was thinking in my head if he

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,440
uh delivered the pie i'm going to dele

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
i'm going to deliver one small slice

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
when we put the presentation together

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,039
we're thinking about

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,680
you know the things that have happened

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
um equifax comes to mind

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
where they found themselves in a

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,039
situation where they were in the

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
headlines and they

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,320
really wish that they hadn't been

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
and so it's really about understanding

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,359
managing the risks around open source

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,840
but

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,600
i think more importantly it's about

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
understanding how the poor

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,920
management of open source uh leads to

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,479
not only

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,600
not being able to manage those risks but

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
also it comes with it

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
with its own set of consequences again

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
ibrahim the gentleman who just spoke he

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,400
had all of these

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,720
17 different ways that you can be

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,280
involved in changing your culture and

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
managing open source and he gave that

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,479
great example of

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
you know there was a word document for

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,560
every piece of open source

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
uh that his development teams wanted to

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,280
use and it required five approvals

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,479
and that's just crazy if you put in poor

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
programs for open source management

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,240
uh then you slow down and you start to

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,759
lose the benefits of open source

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,600
software

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,360
so um you know i think if you came to

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,560
any of the opening sessions today you

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,840
probably heard

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
most if not all of this

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,719
and ibrahim i keep referring to him but

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
everything he said in his presentation

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
is really applicable to what i'm talking

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
about

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
you know the financial industry fintech

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
is really

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,599
the new kid on the block but there's a

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
real rise in a real

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,879
kind of understanding now of the role of

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,920
open source and

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,840
and developing solutions

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,200
and we heard some of the keynotes this

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
morning talk about how digital

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
transformation is so

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,959
so important going from you know uh

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
solutions that were hosted in-house to

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
cloud

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
this is a couple of real interesting

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,599
statistics too that make

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,280
the management of open source more

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,519
important than ever before

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
and it's it's the idea that what we're

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,080
seeing is a rise in financial firms

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
uh being hit with cyber attacks and so

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
there's a couple of

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,959
pretty interesting statistics here in

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,680
terms of how the financial industry

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
seems

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
to see a real growth in cyber attacks

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,440
and so security especially

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
as they're implementing more open source

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,120
software is more important than ever

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,120
before

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,879
so hopefully the reason you're here is

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
because you understand

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
the advantages of open source software

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
but i always like to start here

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,879
because i i i work for a software vendor

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
that provides solutions

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,040
so it's uh you know part of the reason

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,280
i'm here is i want to sell you something

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,879
right i want to i want to sell you some

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
tools that will help you with managing

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,920
your open source software

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,760
and a lot of the times the approach that

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,000
we as salespeople take is we come out

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,640
and we try to scare you

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,760
you know you you know the term fud fear

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
uncertainty and doubt

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
that the concept is oh my gosh open

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,120
source is great but it's

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
you know it's it's really uh there's all

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
these horrible risks that are associated

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
and if you don't manage open source you

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,360
know you're

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,280
you know you're opening yourself to all

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
of these risks and while that's true i

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
think we can't lose sight of the fact

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,640
that those

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,799
risks are are minimal uh you know when

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,680
we look at all the advantages of open

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
source so

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
obviously i think the first thing that

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,159
drew a lot of people to open source was

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,319
there's there's no license fees right so

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,760
there's some cost effectiveness to it

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,560
especially now where we see open source

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,239
providing

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,879
uh you know frameworks and and

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,879
application uh development platforms

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,319
that provide tons of functionality that

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,439
in the past were only provided by

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,160
proprietary

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,959
vendors at high licensing costs faster

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
time to market

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
obviously if you can focus on your on

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
your business logic

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
right the things that allow you to

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
innovate in the market

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,800
right open source can give you a leg up

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,479
reliability

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
from the beginning of open source bruce

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,080
perrin said you know it's really about a

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,759
lot of eyeballs that we could fix

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
problems very quickly

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
and there's a lot of evidence today that

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
suggests that open source

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,479
especially in the more mature

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
communities is

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,000
actually more reliable than a commercial

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
software

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
and then finally community and and i

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
hate to say this but i wish i had known

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,840
this

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
prior to coming today the you know when

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,600
i got here and i started listening to

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,440
people talk they really

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
they're talking more more about the role

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
of community and contribution when you

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,039
use open source

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,479
and i i spoke with jim jagalski who used

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
to be the president apache software

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
foundation

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,759
about an hour ago we kind of talked

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,120
about this and he believes

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,280
that the sense of community is is key

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
and contribution is important but it's

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,680
not absolutely integral to

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
you know providing solutions but it is

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
important

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,039
so the question i have is you know is

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
your software composition analysis

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
non-existent and so

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
this requires a little bit of

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
explanation

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,919
so software composition analysis first

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,199
of all let me explain that term

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,840
i've been working in the open source

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
industry for about 15 years now and

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
during that

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,080
when we first started we talked about

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
open source governance we talked about

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,639
open source scanning right

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,479
and now the the analysts the market

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,759
analysts have now kind of categorized

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
this into something called software

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,600
composition analysis

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
and there's a term emerging called s-bom

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,039
or software bill of materials

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,560
where the idea is you have your

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
proprietary code but you have third

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
party components

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,880
and open source and so managing these

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
third-party components is absolutely

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
essential

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,160
to the success of your program so when

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
we talk about open source in particular

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
we always talk about

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
three key risks right there's the legal

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,680
side of things there's license

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
compliance

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,000
which ultimately leads to a second risk

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,160
which i call copyright infringement

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
when you don't comply with an open

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
source license that license ceases to

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
exist

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
it terminates when it terminates you

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,960
have someone else's code in your product

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
right and they're protected under

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
copyright law so it becomes copyright

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,600
infringement

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,880
and that that is a huge risk that you

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,280
have to manage

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,400
and obviously getting hacked um

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,800
and and security so but

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
but why do you need sca i mean i laid

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
out some risks right

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
and you know i talked about all these

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,319
advantages and everything

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
but but why is software composition

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,680
analysis so important so let's

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,280
let's kind of take a take a look at this

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,759
so i i think the thing that we need to

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,599
talk about is not so much the risks but

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
rather the consequences

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,199
of what happens if you don't manage the

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
open source that comes into your

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
organization right

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,080
so the first thing we like to say in the

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,639
industry

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,639
is you can't manage what you don't know

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
open source is so easily available so

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,599
easily consumable to your

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,639
to your engineers right that even best

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,880
practices where you

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,400
shut down allowing people to use open

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
source they're still going to use it

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,199
right when you acquire third-party

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
commercial components because

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
everybody's using open source

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,120
in your supply chain you will get open

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,800
source in your products

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
if you don't know what those components

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,479
are how can you possibly

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,919
manage them right and

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,280
what ibrahim said again just

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
you know if you have to send out a

00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
document every time you go to use a

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,400
piece of open source

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
and get five approvals and 100 approvals

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,479
are going to

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
requests are going to your legal

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,319
department every day

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,919
we worked with a major insurance company

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,440
that we created a request approval

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,440
process at the beginning of it

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,000
they were doing 12 to 1500

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
requests for open source on a monthly

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,319
basis when they first kind of open the

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,319
floodgates

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,599
and so these processes are absolutely

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,840
essential

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,080
for making sure that you don't slow down

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,919
your development cycles

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
it's the antithesis of why your team

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,519
brought open source in

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,800
and one of my favorite stories was going

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
on a sales call one time

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,440
we had some enterprise architects for

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,959
this was for a large insurance company

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
and they said we have an internal policy

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,320
that prohibits the use of open source

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
software

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
and he goes and they said to a man we

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,959
all use open source software

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
right and so they were telling us you

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,200
know we have this policy but we know we

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,320
use it

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,680
right and so it became you know there

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
was a dichotomy here

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,120
one they had to convince the

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,240
organization why it was so valuable why

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,040
they had to use it

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
and then they had to sort of hide it in

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
certain places to make sure that it

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
didn't

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,680
have consequences for them based on the

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120
company's policies

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,040
and this all leads to losing the key

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
advantages so we list all these key

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
advantages of open source

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,640
but not managing it can start to really

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
negate those

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
and it can open you you know to these

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
key risks that i listed on the previous

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,040
page

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,240
and finally right it's really

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,440
about you know

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,760
not becoming tomorrow's headline

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
so ibrahim like like did this 17-point

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,120
thing

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,640
and it was very detailed and i love that

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
one charity put the ichart that he put

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
up where

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
there was like you know 12 different

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,920
areas and like 20 things underneath that

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
about all the things you can do in all

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,839
the different areas

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,320
and so i'm going to just provide a very

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,640
really

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
60 000 foot level of what i think is

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
really key and what i've seen companies

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
do

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,240
that have allowed them to be successful

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,600
this is really if you're in the infancy

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
of your open source program and you're

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,959
trying to figure out

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,959
what do we do and how do we get there

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
the first thing is to really understand

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
and prioritize risk

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,240
so there are two key areas of legal and

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,600
security what does it really mean for

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,399
your organization

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,839
right and it really becomes important

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,360
that if you don't have the expertise

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,560
within your organization

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
right that understands license

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,440
compliance issues that you work with

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,279
uh legal firms that do for example uh

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
you work with your security teams

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:38,000
to understand you know where you have

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
exposure if you use open source

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,640
the second thing is to establish

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
tolerance levels

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,480
i worked with a bank about 12 years ago

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
that they had an open source policy that

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
was about 175 pages

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
over the next five years they got that

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,680
down to about 20 pages

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
and it was really interesting watching

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
uh the evolution of the document because

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
what they did

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
but that 175 page document started out

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
as

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,079
was a definition of risk across the

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,480
financial organization

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,519
so they said here's where in each of the

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,519
areas of the bank

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,200
in application development where we see

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,880
risk from security and legal

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,640
and what the impact is on our

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
organization

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
so once you understand your risks and

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
you prioritize them the thing

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
that's important is to understand where

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
you believe you have the greatest risk

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
and where you have the least risk and

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,560
the reason this is important

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
is the point that again ibrahim made it

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,720
made in his pre

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,320
previous presentation you can't cover

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
everything all the time you can't know

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
every single piece of open source and

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,079
every single piece of code that you

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
develop

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,079
so prioritizing where you have the

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,640
greatest risk is where you can focus

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,640
your efforts

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,360
and with that you can start to develop

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,360
policies about different areas

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
of product development and product

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,079
delivery

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,680
and so one of the things that we see for

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,959
example from a licensed compliance

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,240
perspective

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,880
uh products that are delivered products

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
that are

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
delivered to a computer an on-prem

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,639
solution delivered to a mobile device to

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
an iot device etc

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,560
those are distributed most open source

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,959
licenses trigger on distribution

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,200
and so that gives you much greater legal

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,519
exposure in those types of applications

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,639
and hosted in cloud applications right

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,920
there's only a few licenses today

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,120
that really uh discuss the use of open

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,519
source technology

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
in the cloud or in a network right and

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,519
so the risk from a license compliance

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
perspective is much lower

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,120
so in terms of the type of analysis you

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,000
do and the type of management that you

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
do

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,959
changes and so you can start to develop

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
policies around this

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,880
all right so enabling your team with the

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,079
right tools is is

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,079
is critical um and again i just have

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,639
three really high level points to think

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,600
about here i believe that education is

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,399
probably the

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
greatest tool you have today one of the

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
things

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,519
that's that's interesting watching open

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,240
source over the last 15 years

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,920
i was interviewing a candidate to help

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,959
our organization with doing open source

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,720
auditing

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,560
and i asked you know how much open

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
source do you use and i said have you

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,399
read any open source licenses

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
and the guy looked at me and goes why

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,760
would i read a license it's free

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,120
right and i mean that's a it's an

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,560
interesting point of view but maybe a

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,920
lot of developers have that so i think

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
you can't assume within your

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,279
organization

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,160
that they understand the role that they

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,800
play

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
in managing the risks or the liabilities

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
that using open source

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,399
exists for your organization and so

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
educating them on your policies right

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,560
educating them on why the policies are

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,399
important how using open source can get

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,680
the company in trouble

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:59,199
right then they can start to take

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,199
you know ownership in managing those

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,399
risks

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
automation is absolutely key and

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,560
especially in large scale

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,160
you you can't have a process you know

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,079
where uh

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
you know you're sending hundreds of of

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
uh requests

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,199
you need uh automatic approval processes

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
you need

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,120
tooling for this type of thing you need

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,279
discovery

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
the legacy of open source scanning

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,440
really came out of

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,360
tools that produce a lot of evidence and

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,040
it required a lot of manual interaction

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
to really determine what open source you

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,079
had

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,800
today tools are getting much better and

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
we're moving

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,079
left in the development cycle to start

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,839
to really

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,680
collect and build your build materials

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,279
in a much more automated fashion

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,040
so this is where software composition

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,240
analysis open source scanning

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
is important and it's important that

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,800
when you select a tool you select tool

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
that'll give you you know a high level

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,560
of automation

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,120
and then finally ongoing monitoring

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,720
and uh so one of the things i think

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
that's that's missed a lot of

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,040
a lot of times and developing policies

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
is

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,720
we think a lot of times about building

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
build materials as a snapshot in time

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,600
right that um

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,680
you know what's going on today do we

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
have a license compliance issue today

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,279
do we have security vulnerabilities in

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,000
the code today well

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,920
that's a sliding scale redis mongodb

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,079
a number of open source communities have

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,639
changed their licensing over time and so

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,800
from a

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,079
compliance perspective to assume that

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
when you have a bill of materials and a

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
set of licenses and compliance steps

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
that you've taken

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,000
to make sure in compliance with that

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
that can change over time so it's

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,839
important that the tool

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
is both used in a way that it

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
incrementally monitors your code as it's

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
being developed as new open source is

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,000
introduced

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,040
but more importantly it's monitoring the

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
communities

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
as new security alerts as new light as

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,720
there's license changes

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
etc happen and so the the tools can

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
actually tell you

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,519
uh that changes are happening and you

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,639
can uh

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,000
move accordingly so

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,519
uh earlier finnos and white source got

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
up and

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,680
i saw them put this slide up and i was

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,199
watching i was going great

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,880
you know this is we're all talking about

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,199
the same stuff

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,839
we did uh my company flexer i did a

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,680
webinar just a week ago with forrester

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,120
and uh we had a senior analyst that

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
really took takes a look at how

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,759
developers use open source

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,399
and what she said is that one developers

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,079
always

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
constantly looking at ways to develop

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,199
faster and get to market quicker

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,880
and they're looking at ways to consume

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
open source faster

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000
and so this concept of moving left in

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,519
the development cycle

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
i think everybody has talked about it

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,600
today but the question really becomes

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,880
you know when and where do you take

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
you know scanning tool software

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,480
composition analysis and insert it into

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
your process

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,759
and i've seen you know a number of

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,839
organizations that are now

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,399
using tooling around github and

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,279
repositories and build tools

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,040
that as open source is being vetted as

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,959
it's being considered for use in the

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,039
product during the design process

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,199
they're looking at it from a license and

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,039
a security vulnerability perspective

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,439
and so sea can help you in that part of

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,679
the process definitely

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,760
and obviously you know integrating it

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,280
into your ci cd so that it's

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,439
it's constantly scanning on an

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,039
incremental basis this is the way we've

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,600
kind of used it traditionally over the

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,959
years

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,839
and this is probably where its greatest

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,160
strength is for many organizations

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,760
there's still an issue of legacy code

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,200
right after it's deployed so there's

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
code bases that maybe you don't have

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,520
your bill of materials today

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,400
and so it's important that you continue

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,000
to scan through that code over time

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
and then not so much on the build cycle

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,200
but in really kind of the consumption

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,080
and adoption level

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,440
this this is really fascinating to me

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
when i first got in the business

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
you know we would talk to people who are

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,320
doing technology acquisitions and we'd

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
ask them about doing

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,679
you know open source compliance scanning

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
and security scanning of the products

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,039
that they were buying

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,160
and they go well that's expensive why

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,000
would we do that

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,320
you know and over time we see now that

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
with

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,200
m a it's become a kind of a de facto

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,640
standard that has become part of the due

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
diligence process

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,919
if your organization is not currently

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
doing that it's essential that you

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,760
incorporate that

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,640
and there's a real in there's a

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
fundamental

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,679
i think it's a human nature concept that

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,880
we have a

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,400
tendency to trust ourselves but not

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,000
trust other people and

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
in relation to what i'm talking about

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,360
what i mean is this

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,440
is that if my engineering has a bunch of

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,919
legacy code right

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,480
i'm a lot less concerned about you know

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
did they

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,520
create some type of compliance and

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
security issue even though all those

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
risks are there

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,840
but if i'm buying somebody else's code i

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,679
got no idea what they've done what their

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
practices are etc

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,960
and so it's it's absolutely essential

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
that that we do

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,679
uh scanning and we and we do software

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,840
composition analysis

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,840
as we bring code in through acquisition

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,600
and so just wanted to do a quick case

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,600
study

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,520
we're working with a company in europe

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
called interneuron their

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
health healthcare industry i wish i had

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,200
a financial industry example

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,960
but this is really interesting they were

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,360
starting to take on a model where

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,080
they wanted to develop products that

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
weren't

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
only proprietary in nature but they

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,400
wanted to provide

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,760
services and products in in an open way

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
of the open source and one of the

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,679
challenges they had

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,799
was you know how do we get people to

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
adopt our products

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,559
when they can buy a competitor and they

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,919
can go work with a commercial vendor

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,240
right

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,840
how do we enable transparency of open

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,480
source use so they know everything we're

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,600
using

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,640
and assure them that it's safe how do we

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,160
decrease the

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,679
knowledge gap around measuring open

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,880
source quality

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,440
and um the solution was was to use a

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,600
software composition analysis tool now

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,039
my company flexera has a tool called

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,360
flexnet code insight

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,200
that's what this company used um this is

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,840
some other companies here today fossa

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
and

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,000
and white source that provide similar

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,679
types of solutions

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
so their whole idea was to build an

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,520
infrastructure that was uh

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,240
that was going to allow them uh to build

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
uh

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,440
discovery build their software bill of

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
materials

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,280
and they have governance tooling in

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,799
place the second thing is really

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
interesting now i've talked about kind

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,760
of some steps

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
that you can take to manage open source

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
from a high level prioritized risks

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,280
right understand where you have the

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,600
greatest exposure develop policies

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,799
educate all of these types of things

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,400
and in a neuron realized they did not

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
have the level of expertise within their

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,120
organization but they wanted to go to

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
market quickly so they actually went to

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
a managed service model

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,240
where they went to a company called

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,679
source code control again this is

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,400
in in europe and uh that had a lot of

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,760
special

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,200
uh specialization on governance

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,159
and how to set up policies etc

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,679
and they really focused on supply chain

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,360
conformance and so

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,720
they realized that their tools both had

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,679
tools coming into it

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,799
and were going into other tools that

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,559
were going to be part of the

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,240
supply chain so they used something from

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,120
the linux foundation called open chain

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,799
as a standard

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,400
to provide supply chain conformance

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,400
i'm going to skip the benefits for now i

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
just realized i have limited time so

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
the cto made this comment every

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
application we develop and deliver on

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
today

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,080
uses open source software together with

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,720
flexnet code insight and source code

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
control

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,080
we're confident that our solutions are

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
both vulnerability free

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,960
and license compliant our customers

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,159
trust us to deliver that 100 of the time

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,320
so this was um this was really the whole

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,480
purpose of putting a program in place

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
and and developing the expertise to be

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
able to

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
to make this commitment to their

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,039
customers and

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,159
it provided significant business units

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,320
or business benefits right

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
so it removed the risk from purchasing

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,360
decisions

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,039
by showing to your customers that you

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,400
have comprehensive programs in place for

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,440
vulnerability checking

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,760
and a complete bill of materials is key

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,880
um by doing all of the vetting of the

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,440
open source components

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,120
as part of their process right they have

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,840
a quality consistent open source

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,080
compliance and risk management

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
one of the key benefits they saw was new

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,159
key business or it was a

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,840
new business opportunity so previously

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,320
remember their challenge was proving to

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
people

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,280
that open source was every from them was

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,080
every bit as good as commercial

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,600
or proprietary software once they had

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,799
the program in place and they had the

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,919
proof points

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,679
then they they were able to find new

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,559
prospects and build trust with new

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,200
organizations

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
so it created new opportunities for them

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,919
and it just

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
it overall improved their accountability

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,960
and security

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,960
not just the products that they sold but

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,919
within their own internal systems

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,039
and higher quality code and more uh

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,400
robust systems

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,400
yeah our solutions

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,880
so i just i wanted to keep this short i

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
realized i only had 25 minutes and just

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,679
want to see if anybody has any questions

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,840
at the end

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,520
so this is really about you know at a

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,280
very very high level

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,840
kind of understanding the steps that you

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,240
can take as an organization to start to

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,760
really combat the idea of you know am i

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
going to wake up tomorrow

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,480
have to write a press release that says

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,080
because we weren't managing open source

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
you know we have a security problem or

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
we have a compliance issue

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,280
um just some key takeaways so i

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,360
mentioned i spoke with forrester

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,080
developer teams continue to move faster

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,640
view open sources as a top priority to

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,200
enable speed to market

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
and your your developers and for those

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,279
of you who are developers

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,039
obviously you understand this probably

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,600
better than anybody

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,279
software composition uh analysis

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,440
empowers companies to use

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,039
open source effectively and it's really

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
about empowering and enabling your

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,679
organization to be much more effective

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,840
with their use of open source

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,600
organizations must look to integrate

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,440
software composition

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
analysis earlier in the software

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,360
development life cycle

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,559
a number of people are really talking

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
about that that's really kind of the

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,640
next phase

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,799
we used to be more of a post-process

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
analysis tool now we're moving it left

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,520
in the development cycle

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,279
and i really think my key point today is

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,400
that a poorly executed

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,679
program can really decrease a lot of the

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
reasons

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,679
that developers using so much so much

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,480
open source today

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
and finally taking a solution approach

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
to understanding your risk

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,799
tolerance and implementing the right

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,640
policies

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,520
you know will help you in doing ongoing

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,840
management of open source software

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,000
so with that i want to see if there's

00:24:44,840 --> 00:25:01,279
any

00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:04,000
questions it's kind of late in the day

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,400
okay so the question is i talked about

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
you know

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,080
a long approval process can i talk about

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,440
possible solutions to that

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,840
so uh yes so

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
the one of the concepts we've been

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,760
talking to

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,720
a number of large software companies

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,000
and um one of the things that they're

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,640
talking about today kind of

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,840
in their lexicon is this concept of

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,360
fidelity

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,440
okay from a software composition

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,440
analysis perspective and it really ties

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,320
into what i was talking about

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,480
in in terms of prioritizing

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,760
understanding prioritizing risk

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,919
so the point is this that rather than

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,320
requiring every single developer to

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,440
report every single piece of

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,840
open source right you designate

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,520
under what conditions right how the

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,520
product is being built

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,880
how it's being distributed who the

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,320
market is

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,360
what kind of uh exposure you know do you

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,799
have what kind of attack

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
vectors do you have from a security

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,360
perspective etc

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
and require that that the approval

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,200
process

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,960
from a manual perspective only

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,799
go for those things that are at the

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,960
highest at the highest

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,000
level of fidelity where you need the

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
greatest

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,600
uh you know if you if you're thinking

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,880
about a microscope as an analogy

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,400
right the things that you need to put

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,520
under the microscope so you start

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
categorizing

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
your your product area and your

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
application development so that's the

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,840
first thing

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,279
the second thing is that there are

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,000
plenty of tools out there today they're

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,039
tools

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,159
that we provide there's

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,960
business process management tools right

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,640
that can implement um you know process

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,799
workflows within your organization and

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,640
those can be set up with business rules

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,640
and so a lot of what happens is your

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,559
legal organization

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:58,400
can start to set and say

00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:01,679
for example a certain class of licenses

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,039
creates virtually no risk for us okay

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,799
and those types of things the developer

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,720
goes in and says okay i want to use

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,080
these sets of libraries i want to use

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,760
this framework and based on the

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,279
licensing information

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,799
they still have a you know a requirement

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,400
to submit this into some type of a

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,520
workflow process and that that actually

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,640
could be automated

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,159
but when they submit it then the the

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,840
business rules will automatically

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,159
approve those components

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,919
right and only in the cases where it's

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,760
high fidelity do you really

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,679
care and want to take a second look so

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,279
it's really about automating a request

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,399
approval workflow

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,039
it it's interesting um our solution

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,640
really started um with a company called

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,000
palamida about 15 years ago and it was

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
really about open source scanning it was

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,240
about

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,840
taking a code base scanning it and see

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,200
if we could find any evidence of

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,520
third-party components in it right today

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
we engage many customers that we go and

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,320
we say hey we got a great scanning

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,840
engine they go we don't care

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,760
we don't care about scanning what we

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,559
care about is request approval workflow

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,000
and how do we

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,760
how do we kind of smooth that out and so

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
we're working with another a number of

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,240
companies where we built

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,880
pretty complex uh systems to really kind

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
of

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,510
you know reduce friction if you will so

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:22,990
just a couple ideas

00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,990
