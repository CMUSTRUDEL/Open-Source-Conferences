Description: 
	Jim Northey | FIX Trading Community | Standards Through the Looking Glass: Disruption, Competition, and the Role of Open Source and Open Communities | FINOS OSSF 2019

Jim Northey, Co-Chair Global Technical Committee, FIX Trading Community

A look at the standards landscape from a macroeconomic and geopolitical perspective, possible learnings from forty years of commitment to standards from material science to computer science to financial technology. A brief review of FIX as the original Fintech disruptor. Do standards still have a role in the age of disruption due to the massive sociological change brought on by the Fourth Industrial Revolution? The talk will meander with some musings on some of the principles of standardization, the nature of communities, a visit back to Hintjens' social architecture. A discussion on key standards that could impact or be impacted by the current wave of Fintech disruption and innovation. How knowledge representation, machine learning, and natural language processing can be applied to standardization via machine readable specifications using the open meta-standard FIX Orchestra as an example in Fintech.

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:20,430
hi everybody my name's Jim Northey let

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:25,460
me see if I can get back to the slides

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:29,599
here and I want to back up a bit

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,610
do we go back to the beginning here oh

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,579
there we go okay there we go okay hi I'm

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,290
Jim Northey and I'm the global one of

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,800
the global technical committee co-chairs

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,180
of the fix standard organization and I'm

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,050
also some surprisingly the chair of ISO

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,140
TC 68 which is responsible for all the

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,199
financial services standards globally

00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,930
even even some of the ones that rich

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:03,600
Robinson besmirched before me and so

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,720
what I want to talk today about is is

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,970
open source and open standards and sort

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,100
of take a looking sort of through the

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,020
looking-glass approach so let me see

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,060
yeah all right there we go

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,909
I probably hit that one too many times

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,860
so so my conjecture today going back

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:25,110
from my readings from undergraduate

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,869
school of Karl Popper conjectures and

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:35,340
refutations you know my conjecture is is

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:37,110
that the open standards are good open

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,930
source is good but when you're able to

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,299
combine open source and open standards I

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,460
think you really have something and I

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,290
switch languages here so we go outside

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,659
the standard language and switch to

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,310
Portuguese you know you have the best of

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,700
both worlds open standards and open

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,070
source and so and rich sort of mentioned

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,520
this because I think he stole my slide

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,149
he saw me working on and earlier they're

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,509
really about both about community and

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:09,179
yes I am a recovering consultant than a

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,879
12-step program now for for recovering

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,379
consultants but I think there's

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,379
something really important there because

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:25,260
it seems like communities you know when

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,470
you're in a good community but most

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,450
people don't introspect and take a step

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,140
back and actually think about what makes

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:37,370
up a good community and I think rich has

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,350
made a very good point you can have open

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,150
communities that are completely closed

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,700
you can have other closed communities

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,900
which are so open so I think we have to

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,480
really understand what we're talking

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,860
about with open and so I want to go back

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,570
a little bit further and talk about some

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,900
things that make up community and I want

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,920
to go back to sort of so I'm an old guy

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,090
hopefully I won't be doing this too much

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,280
longer but I started reading and I came

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,240
into the industry in the 1970s it's just

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,340
a really great time for for technology

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,260
innovation and one of those books was a

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,360
psychology of computer programming and

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,650
these titles still have relevance today

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,340
even though they're part of sort of our

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,050
history people where by Tom Dick Marko

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,880
Cathedral and Bazaar of course that's

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,830
probably why we're here

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,230
but there's a there's a book that I

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,930
think I would recommend anybody who's

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,910
interested in creating a viable open

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,120
community that that can actually produce

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,850
and that's a book by Peter Hitchens

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,890
named social architecture if and if and

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,420
if any of you don't know Peters name

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,470
unfortunately Peter passed away a few

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,570
years ago Peter was one of the key

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,850
architects of something called AMQP

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,570
which is still important but he left

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,780
AMQP any left AMQP because of the the

00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:00,570
community issues and around that and he

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,100
created something called zero MQ and I

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,260
don't know if anybody's familiar with 0

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,420
mq but but he purposely use 0 mq 2 also

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,020
researched sort of the social psychology

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,120
and how to build effective communities

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,980
around open source and open standards so

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,080
I recommend that book to you and then

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,660
also the mythical man-month by Fred

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,250
books how many of you know I've heard of

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,229
with the mythical man-month the book oh

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,980
that's pretty good there's a bunch of

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,820
old people too in the audience

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,220
good so you know so we're to start with

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,870
this community and some of the themes

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,240
that you take away from social

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,180
architecture book are one start with a

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,150
compelling problem start with a problem

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,970
that people will want to work on even if

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,770
they're not paid all right start with

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,240
something if you don't have a compelling

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,820
problem there's something that needs to

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,010
be solved then you might as well stop

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,930
the other thing and and this really goes

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,000
to the heart of what I why I think to

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,010
fix how many would argue that the fixed

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,730
protocol was reasonably successful

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,070
anybody

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:10,300
show of hands fix was fairly successful

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:13,170
as 27 years old now the you have to

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,580
establish some sense of fairness and

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,830
this word openness where your

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,650
contributions can be heard you're not

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,140
going to be biased to one person one one

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,120
person in a dominant role can kill an

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,720
open-source project we've seen it time

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,150
and time again open standards one one

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,230
entity can kendama nate and control

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,540
standards to where people won't

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,970
participate anymore so this there's a

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,010
key structure and fairness shouldn't be

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,740
a default thing it should be put in

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:45,520
indesign and when the fix organization

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,350
started we had solomon and and fidelity

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,180
we had a buy side in the sell side and

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,860
said why are we all going to build all

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,540
these interfaces as we're starting to

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,690
move away from the telephone and moving

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,760
to electronic trading and what they

00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,290
decided to do is when they said alright

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,140
we got to have an organization around

00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:05,770
this they had here's a by side leader

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:08,350
here's a sell side leader and it's not

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,050
only about who you include it's who you

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,230
excluded who did fix exclude in the

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,750
early years they excluded vendors who

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,850
else did they exclude they excluded the

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,520
exchange community they wanted to focus

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,590
on just the consumers the people who

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,950
needed to solve the problem and I think

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,860
that access and that openness really has

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,600
carried forward and I would encourage

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,700
all those people that are said Infini

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,100
less and these other initiatives to sort

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,320
of take some lessons from from that

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,040
structure the other key I think it is

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,170
and we saw that with fix and

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,870
with many other open-source issues is

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,640
deliver early gets get some initial

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,320
feedback and get something going that

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,540
you can get out there and refute in the

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,260
market and then so the question we

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,620
always struggle with in the fixed world

00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,320
now 27 years on is what do we do about

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,940
the free rider problem okay what do we

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,240
do about the free random but I would

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,410
tell you that through the looking-glass

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,500
even though the free rider problems off

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,930
studied in economics you know the

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,770
current trend is is we have

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,890
multinational corporations that are

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,260
actually largely writing and I having a

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,270
free rider problem but when you think

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,970
about it from our perspective what would

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,430
Linux be without free writers you know

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,040
who imagined today and I just learned

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,290
this a couple I was doing some work and

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,870
I finally made peace with something

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,700
called maven I hate that yes so I

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,740
finally have accepted that may even

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,350
exist in it and it actually seems to be

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,970
making my life better now anyway what

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,150
was amazing was when I went to install

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,520
that you can run a Linux subsystem on

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,350
any Windows 10 platform not only that

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,060
when you go to install it you can pick

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,870
from any one of the distributions I mean

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,080
that's incredible

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,390
you know what I don't view that everyone

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,000
in open source and open standards should

00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,700
say we want the free writer opportunity

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,190
all right I mean I think that's I think

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,010
that's key and and we can look at the

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,990
one from a history standpoint of

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,550
something called quick fix I don't know

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,160
if anybody out there uses a fixed

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,240
protocol anybody use fix at all in the

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:20,420
audience that one person up there okay

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,490
well before before we get into quick fix

00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,670
so I do want to talk about these key

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,800
themes one is in people where book we

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,400
talk about the environment in which to

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,599
work and why I like that book is is

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,810
DiMarco and Lister's start out and they

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:39,650
say hey we have no idea how you can get

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,270
team gel but all we know is without team

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,660
gel your projects not going to succeed

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,400
so they say we don't know what can

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,720
create team gel but we can give you a

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,660
list of things that will be guaranteed

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,550
to kill team gel and one of those things

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,840
that they mentioned will kill team gel

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,000
and I see it in every

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,700
company I go to now is the OpenOffice

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,220
environment you know to me open office

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,280
environments are the Anathem of software

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,600
development so the the other book I want

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,700
to talk about mythical man-month from

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,830
fred book he had the structure for a

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,580
chief programming team i would argue

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,660
that most open-source projects now are

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,760
self-organizing versions of the chief

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,740
programmer team where you have a couple

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,920
key committers on top and many other

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,570
people involved in the process and you

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,790
organically build and these things are

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,140
allowed to come together we don't have

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,820
to talk about the cathedral and the

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,690
bazaar the book is probably why we're

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,280
here

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,760
one of the things that's often

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,950
overlooked is the power of github I mean

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,900
so if you went to a bunch of software

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,150
developers today and said okay that's

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,770
all fine but we're gonna have to have

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,900
code inspections and official

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,940
walkthrough meetings right you'd find

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,710
yourself out on the street on the other

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,000
hand if you say okay we've got a few key

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,110
committers and if anybody is going to

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
commit something they're gonna have to

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,700
do it by way of a pull request which

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,560
basically is a code walkthrough they'll

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,650
say oh yeah that's great pull requests

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,960
are cool so and then the other key is of

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,910
course social architecture which I

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,740
encourage you all to take a look at

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,540
because this is a person who develop

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,280
many open-source software project and

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,620
then he just took a step back he said

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,570
let's really think about communities and

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,050
what it takes to make one and and make a

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,610
viable product and standard so so when

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,290
we look at this case study that I'm

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,780
trying to say open standards and open

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,030
source I want to start with fix case

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,700
study number one so there was this thing

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,070
called quick fix it started in 2001 in

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,170
2002 by Warren Miller and Jim Downes and

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,820
it was actually funded by a small

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,850
company called thought works and Derrick

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,070
5,000 people now globally and it was one

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,350
of the first major financial markets

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,570
open source products quick fix J came

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,610
along later by Steve Bates it's now

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,010
Mumbai maintained by Christopher John's

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,080
at McDonald's associates we also have

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,600
many variants when I would go around the

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,210
world teaching fix I would ask people

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,980
how many used quick fix and about

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,100
three-quarters of the audience globally

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,380
would would would raise their hand and

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,630
and so so the question is in the fix

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,190
organization

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,890
there's our standard on the webpage

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,010
here's the quick fix page the question I

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:16,430
always ask is would fix have been as

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,470
successful of a protocol and it is the

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,520
default language of TRO of the trading

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,160
industry now without quick fix and I

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,060
would argue not and I will go a step

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,050
further if if there was a good copyleft

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,640
license the number of global

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,990
multinational publicly traded exchanges

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,820
that would have to hope and raise their

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,490
hand and admit they're using quick fixes

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,000
or fix interface would be people would

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:47,840
be astounded and amazed by that so so my

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,030
first case to you is that the fixed

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,700
standard itself shows the power of open

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:55,370
source combined with an open standard

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,470
and then the next case I want to want to

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,750
start to talk about is is this is an

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,100
anticipatory standard means we're trying

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,800
to build a standard is something called

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,690
fix orchestra and what did I say in the

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,640
beginning you have to start with a real

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,610
problem that people can embrace and

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,020
understand and the fixed protocol it was

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,550
started by a bunch of people who weren't

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,680
stators people they said we just need to

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,080
get together so our standard was loosely

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,750
specified we didn't have conformance

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,000
tests I learned a valuable lesson from

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,550
the National Institute of Standards when

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,970
I was diverted to work on the smart grid

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,130
and the key there was your standard is

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,050
measured by conformance to that standard

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,340
and what your conformance tests are

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,080
anyway so within fix we have a we

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,090
usually document these things by human

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,370
readable documents that in short are

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,070
sparse on information and not directly

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,780
actionable so is created multiple pain

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,190
points throughout the lifecycle I'm

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,280
going to move through quick here looking

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,890
at my time and so you know what we have

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,560
is operational efficiencies and another

00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,240
thing is they have a really good analogy

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,150
that you can use to explain things to

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,500
what fix Orchestra how many can I are

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,120
old enough to remember when you get a

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,620
new ethernet card and plug it in and

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,810
have to put different dip switches you

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,760
had to download drivers you got a new

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,440
printer you had to download drivers all

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,630
of that was replaced by plug-and-play

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,550
standards and technologies and drove

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,620
that what we're trying to bring the fix

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,730
now is no one's going to we know that no

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,410
one's going to be we

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,839
riding their fix infrastructure it's

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,089
dial tone you know I mean fixes

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,829
equivalent to voice over IP at this

00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,870
point it's it's so better that no one's

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:32,449
going to make any major investments but

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,029
there still is all this inefficiency at

00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:37,070
a higher level so our assumption is that

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,230
we need to come up with some mechanism

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,839
that sits over the top of there so again

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,459
make sure you test your assumptions of

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,050
the community and the solution or

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,339
proposing and we have a set of

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,279
assumptions that we made for the

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,329
standard and so what does fix Orchestra

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,360
do it's a standard for exchanging

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:55,579
machinable rule readable rules of

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,310
engagements one of the other assumptions

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:00,649
we made which I think it was important

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,660
is that this machine readable

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,490
specification if I'm going to invest any

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,350
time and money into it it better be

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,510
support a heck of a lot more than fix

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,820
because there's about 150 different

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,620
proprietary protocols so we made sure

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,600
that fix Orchestra could be used for

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,010
basically any type of messaging because

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,120
if you're going to do any automation

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,380
even if you're starting at the

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,209
grassroots level and just doing

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,130
scripting you'd sure like to know it

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,990
could be used for for any type of

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,690
messaging protocol internet including

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,459
your internal messaging and so so

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,959
Orchestra content is all machine

00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:37,060
readable and more importantly it's open

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:39,740
open source and open standards and

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,260
coincidentally you know this events

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,269
being sponsored by github but we're

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,220
moving all of our technical standards to

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:53,779
github and that wasn't a novel idea we

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:56,329
we followed the w3c which moved there

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:59,839
using markdown and publishing so you

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,670
don't think we're not beyond climbing

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,910
onto any good idea that we see out there

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,459
so another case study fixed latest we

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,079
actually ended up with the problem where

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:11,990
we made a couple decisions to break

00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,180
backward compatibility in in the modern

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,040
age now you know backward compatibility

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,569
is important you know new release of the

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,610
language even if it's a point release

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:21,079
you'll find out it breaks you know you

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,060
look at typescript and some of these

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,730
other things there is no concept of

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,769
continuity and backward compatibility

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:32,860
anyway we made a couple roadblocks and

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,860
we broke it so so what we did was we

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,350
to solve this problem we actually came

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,420
out with the concept of ficks latest and

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,550
again we're refactoring the

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,280
specification every time we extend it

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,720
any new new tag and even field any of

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,730
your message they guess that gets

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,640
published and if you look at the open

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:54,790
source places again open source we use

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,800
github markdown we use pan doc to

00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,080
convert these into those pesky documents

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,810
that humans like to see those PDF frozen

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,210
in time documents Orchestra open source

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,550
open standard Orchestra tools that we

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,260
put in the open source key and then we

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,080
also have some Orchestra tools that are

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,270
available just to the community and this

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,510
the next one I'll talk about is a third

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,730
case study is something we call Congo

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,970
the issue is is that fix is the language

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,190
of trading but not many people are very

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,170
interested in having session level

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,810
protocols and having to have a fix

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,150
engine so what we did was we created the

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,370
the conga proof-of-concept which takes

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,560
the fixed latest data dictionary that's

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,620
all the hundreds of messages available

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,170
in fix or fixed to four to please don't

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,680
use that anymore

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:47,140
JSON and simple binary encoding and you

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,820
can pick which encoding you want and it

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,640
runs over our fixed high-performance

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,380
session later in and WebSockets so in

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,810
this demo which is available on patch e

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,090
2.0 we threw in something just a little

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,690
extra to make it interesting it has a

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,970
full matching engine so what we wanted

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,010
to do what we did is I did an analysis

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,540
of 85 of the crypto currency exchanges

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,070
and what I did was I saw all of

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,839
evolution everyone started with a

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:14,350
restful interface then they soon

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,820
realized well trading is not a restful

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,430
type thing you're not talking to a

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,260
resource so then they started to move

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,000
the WebSockets then you would see in

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,440
their evolution they start moving to

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,850
WebSockets with heart beating because

00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,100
you realize you need to have a key plot

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,170
and pretty soon they pretty much through

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,690
a learning curve and wasting a lot of

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:34,210
time they've replicated a large part of

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,370
the the fixed standard so we put this

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,220
out there for the community again idea

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,590
of open source plus open standards ok

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,200
and there it is just the proof in the

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,289
pudding so open source plus open

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,019
software and then

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:51,210
I've got about eight minutes here so

00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,549
next I want to talk to about the data

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,769
conundrum now so I think most of that

00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:58,679
before that was pretty good news and in

00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:01,559
a good approach but now we have this

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,759
it's it is about the data you know it's

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:08,840
so easy now because of open source to

00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:12,570
encode a message to get messaging I mean

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,549
you know use your JSON or simple binary

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,590
encoding all with very strong open

00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:18,749
source implementations run them over

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,249
your Kafka bus you can encrypt that you

00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:23,340
I mean you can get something up and

00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:25,470
running quickly the issue is the content

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,840
of the data and the value of the data

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,409
and the semantics and context center is

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,859
the key but so how many I've seen this

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:36,749
cartoon this is one of my favorites so

00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:38,909
you know situation there are competing

00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:41,340
standards and it's at 14 ridiculous we

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,570
need a standard to develop one universal

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,849
standard that covers every one of the

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,830
use cases we said yeah and then the next

00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:49,710
thing I'll say we have 15 standard well

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,559
so I was right after the credit crisis I

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,149
was testifying before the CFTC and to my

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,399
right was a gentleman who's very much

00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:58,470
involved in international standards I

00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,879
won't mention Richard so Lee's name

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,849
because I don't want to embarrass it

00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:06,059
anyway Richard who I've known since the

00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:07,619
and again I'm really old how many you

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,559
guys remember the calm korba bells

00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:13,889
anybody here anybody remember Microsoft

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,019
comm versus korba yeah yeah so yeah so I

00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:18,659
was kind of in the Corps beside you know

00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:21,149
with Richard actually and then there's a

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,559
Microsoft little did we know the answer

00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,450
was going to be none of the above

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,099
that was actually the choice you should

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,119
have you should have chosen anyway so

00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:32,489
we're sitting there and Richard goes the

00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,789
problem is were you have an N plus one

00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:36,989
standards problem in your industry and

00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:39,840
Richard's very compelling speaker by the

00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:41,849
way and he says you incited great he was

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,679
so how we're gonna solve this n1 plus

00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,960
one standard problem and he's testifying

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,700
and so the testimonies recorded for

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,419
posterity goes we're gonna create a new

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,249
standard and so anyway so I just turned

00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,539
and looked at them and just smiled and

00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,759
gave him you know stupid a lot I'm

00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:59,460
pretty good at stupid looks but so when

00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,979
it comes to data which I really think is

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,879
the key and I think rich in the earlier

00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:07,889
talk also mentioned that we really do

00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:08,789
need to address data and semantics

00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:11,729
because that's the key

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:14,789
but the problem is we've got the EDM

00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:16,499
council we've got with their FIFO we've

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,419
got is des with their new common data

00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:20,369
model we've got the fix trading

00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,919
community which has we don't have a data

00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:25,619
dictionary and we're not aspirational to

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,960
actually sort of try to gather territory

00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:30,029
but there's a lot of value in semantics

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,460
and data that are in those we have iso

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:35,519
20022 which actually does have a

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,529
complete data model of the the financial

00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,450
instrument business information model is

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,789
all contained within the iso 20022

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,799
standard we have open Figgy which has an

00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:46,710
elaborate metadata model and something

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,859
I'm really keen on is actus which gives

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,389
an algorithmic definition to the

00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,919
products and actually defines everything

00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:55,289
as cash flows which i think is very

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,779
valuable it's the corner and then on top

00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:00,509
of this plop here comes fin ovis

00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:04,649
financial objects and what I'm hoping

00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:07,769
that we can do with this is is to try to

00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:09,839
make maybe fin OS can be a point of

00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:13,229
convergence I mean each one of these

00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,960
efforts is good and data data semantics

00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:18,450
and contact is just nothing but hard

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,580
work all right and but I'm hoping that

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,899
maybe we can use this as a point where

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,429
we can maybe bring some of this stuff

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,559
together and hopefully we'll have some

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:28,169
more conversations okay so a four

00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,089
minutes to go so fix our fixed global

00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,159
Technical Committee focus just to last

00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,489
word was what we tried to address this

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,080
year with operational inefficiencies

00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:38,519
getting fixed latest out there so people

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,769
don't have to worry about fixed

00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,739
versioning anymore and then fin text

00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,359
disruption and in 2020 is now we have to

00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:48,749
go around and tell people what we built

00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,639
out there on the in github land and so

00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:52,259
and I think the problem with trying to

00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:55,529
communicate anything is trying to get

00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,989
above the din and what it's not enough

00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:00,450
to say oh we're gonna try to market and

00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:03,119
let people know and educate them the

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,649
problem is is that and if you haven't

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,200
seen this movie you need to see this

00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:09,839
movie right it's called the bit player

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,909
it's about Claude Shannon and he came up

00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,960
with the fundamental information

00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:16,279
information model as

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,779
part of his master's degree thesis and

00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,970
what what's happened at this point now

00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,419
is there so much information all

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,950
information is noise and so how it's not

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,720
enough to say we're gonna go out market

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,370
education it is really difficult to

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,770
communicate anything out there with the

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,870
level of information our brains aren't

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,700
designed to take on all this so

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,630
everything comes in like static on the

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,789
radio Jim white song um so fixed trading

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,649
community and open source what I've

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,020
tried to communicate to you today in the

00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:48,390
short amount of time available was that

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,909
we see open standards and open source is

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,730
being partnered and and important to

00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:55,320
work together and and it brings about

00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:00,240
standardization it also allows for open

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,309
source projects do to compete and this

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,460
is our overall technical stack as of

00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:07,470
August 2009 teen why data becomes

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,179
important is look we have several

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,190
application layers but then we have

00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,679
multiple messaging coatings we have

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,260
multiple messaging session layers over

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:21,899
multiple transports and the key here is

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,909
that it's the data that rides across all

00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:27,149
these things that that is what's

00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:30,110
important and it's interesting what's

00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:32,669
really good is that many of the fin OS

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:35,279
sponsors and founding organizations are

00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,960
the same ones that support the fixed

00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,120
trading organization so we have two

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,070
minutes and three seconds left any

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,490
questions about fix and where we're

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,580
going

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:51,470
any comment yes sir you you're right and

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:57,260
fix for to is well I will say this for

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:57,260
equity order routing okay fix for two

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,450
I'm going to turn the question around if

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:05,580
you if you're doing equity order routing

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,559
why would you ever consider moving away

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,590
from fixed for two and there is there's

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,289
no compelling reason and so fixed 4.2

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,789
will always be a standard I think some

00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,600
of you people are young not many and

00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:20,130
it's nice to see old faces in the crowd

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,240
will all be retired in fixed for to is

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,429
going to run because it solved the

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,169
problem and I would say don't force a

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,430
standard or try to change something if

00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:28,350
you don't have a bow

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,850
proposition and fix for two for equity

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,010
order running now when you start going

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:35,160
into fixed income when you start going

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:37,650
into other asset classes fixed 4.4 is

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,270
the key standard we had some political

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,340
mistakes because the organization

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,980
sometimes becomes the tail wagging the

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,690
dog that created a fix five-o what we've

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,270
tried to do is eliminate all that and

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,130
fix latest essentially is whatever we

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,170
define and fix running over fix for for

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,090
transport so I think in the world you'll

00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,910
have fix latest run over fix four four

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,340
four four multi asset classes deep post

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,020
trade work there's a lot of work going

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,700
on in settlement especially driven by

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,550
Blackrock and other companies to

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,860
actually and we had this big war and

00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:11,490
fallout between Swift and the ISIL

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,350
community and fix in 2005 it was covered

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,180
in the press and it was on so I took

00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,370
over the ISIL relations Swift

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,280
relationship in 2006 and started to

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,930
rebuild that and so when Blackrock came

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,720
along and said we're gonna push fix all

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,670
the way through settlement what what

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,020
happened was when I started looking at

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,450
what they were trying to automate there

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,790
was no messaging there's so much a post

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,710
trade and settlement in custody that's

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,540
still a manual process with spreadsheets

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,180
telephone calls and things like this

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,860
that there's huge opportunities to for

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,090
everyone and what we're going to do is

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,790
try to make sure that that's available

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:47,700
no matter if you're using ISO 20022 the

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:50,280
Swift Network or DTCC or you're using

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,650
fix connected to connect so anyway any

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,390
other questions

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,940
okay I think my times up but thank you

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,670

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,089
