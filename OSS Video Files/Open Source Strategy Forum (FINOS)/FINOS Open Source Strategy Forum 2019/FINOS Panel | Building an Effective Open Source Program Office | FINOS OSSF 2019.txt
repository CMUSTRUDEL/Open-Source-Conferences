for wipro technologies if you're not

00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,680
familiar with them we're one of the

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
large

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,719
global systems integrators around 9

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,960
billion in revenue and

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,040
today we probably have around 25 000

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,840
plus open source developers

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
this is actually around my 21st year in

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,799
in open source

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
so go back a little ways here and and uh

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,000
we do a lot of work today around

helping enterprises figure out what

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,119
their open source strategy should be and

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
and how they part of that's how they

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,080
should build a uh effective program

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
office

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,400

it's a telecom uh company so i work

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,200
uh as an open source process lead

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
for fujitsu and i've been working in

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,360
open source industry for quite some time

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,399
we started off in india working for

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,240
samsung and then

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,600
came here and worked for blackduck

software so

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,439
uh so yeah so i handled the open source

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,840
program for fujitsu right now

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
hi uh my name is murli county i'm with

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
wells fargo

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,439
uh the cto's office uh wells fargo is a

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,399
very large bank

270 000 employees and 40 000 in

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
technology so

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,959
we you know consume a lot of open source

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
software

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,360
and uh we uh you know have been you know

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,239
optimizing

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
our you know technology program you know

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,879
balancing

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
developer productivity with risk

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
mitigation so i wanted to share some

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,200
thoughts there great thank you

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,040
um so andrew i'd like to start with you

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
um you know this panel is about building

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,920
an open source program office

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,959
first i'd like to set the stage by uh

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,720
having you

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,879
um go over sort of what what are the

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,879
components of an open source

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
program and an open source program

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,000
office and sort of

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,840
how the parts interrelate okay so

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
some of that is is kind of obvious like

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
it has to be cross-functional

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
right has to have representatives from

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,560
all the key stakeholders in an

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
organization and what a lot of people

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
miss about that is the operational

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
elements

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,480
so it's good to have representatives

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
even if they're just part-time from

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,840
procurement and hr

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
right legal is pretty obvious

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,720
development's pretty obvious

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
architecture's pretty obvious and so on

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
but a lot of organizations miss the fact

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
that you need to have some

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,519
representation from

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,560
from hr and procurement

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,120
and one of the first and sorry the other

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,360
piece that's

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,599
some organizations miss is it's always

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
good to have an executive sponsor

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,080
so those are those are some of the the

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,040
core elements and aspects

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,519
and the other pieces from a for program

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
office

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
don't always just focus on the tactical

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
and execution elements of running a

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,159
program and making sure you're compliant

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
and

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
that you have a consumption and

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
contribution model

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,280
pay attention to some of the higher

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,400
order aspects right

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,879
figure out why you're actually

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,840
building a program office what are the

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,599
goals mission

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
vision those are squishy things but

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
they're really really important

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,480
and then lastly and then i'll let and

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,120
move on

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
success metrics right you have to be

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,840
able to measure

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,959
how effective your program office is so

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,439
great thank you andrew um murli

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,040
you have both been involved in building

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,080
the open source program

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,959
um at your respective enterprises

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,639
coming from different spaces so fujitsu

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
network communication builds

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,079
enterprise hardware for

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
telecommunications and obviously

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,440
morally you're at a very different

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
institution at a large bank's technology

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
organization

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
but what are some of the lessons you've

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,720
learned about about how to

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
structure and build out an open source

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
program office

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
from your experience doing so your

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,479
enterprises so fujitsu uh

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
let's start so so fujitsu just doesn't

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,120
do telecom they do a lot of other things

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
right

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
but i work for a network communication

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,280
so the biggest problem that i see

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,479
is scaling the program office from one

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
division to the whole

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,199
enterprise so uh so no other

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
like there are business units small

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,440
small small business units

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,840
using open source but not really

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
enhancing the way they should use it

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,520
so there is a program office in one

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,240
business unit how can we scale that

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
across the enterprise so what i believe

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
is

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
uh is having open source program office

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
as a service

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
to uh to all the different business

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,160
units like like some

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,000
companies have id as a service so why

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
not open source program office as a

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
service

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,880
so at fujitsu we are looking into

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,400
something that but uh

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,160
but yeah this that's the biggest problem

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,880
that i see uh

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,680
in in big enterprises like financial and

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,320
telecommunication and other things

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
yeah we have had a similar journey i

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
mean

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,479
as part of our you know supply chain

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
management

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,160
we uh manage the ingress of

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,639
software whether it's vendor software or

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,680
open source software through the channel

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,960
and uh given the you know

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,240
the nature of our you know industry and

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,280
uh the sensitivity towards risk you know

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
we have uh you know put in a you know a

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
set of processes

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
to make sure that we are thoughtful and

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,759
methodical in the way we bring in

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
over the last several years there's been

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,520
a lot of education

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
uh letting the technology community

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
understand

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,080
the you know the spirit of the licensing

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,600
etc and that has matured quite a bit

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,919
we have now begun to pivot because

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
we can't just really have and program

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,600
office

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
you know you know in triangulating the

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
needs and the supply

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,160
you know the space at which software is

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
changing

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,720
we are a global bank uh you know lots

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,840
and lots of developers consuming

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,000
software

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
we recognize that we need you know

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,520
automated machinery

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,199
to manage the you know you know

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,160
procurement of software

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,840
so we've uh you know begin to optimize

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
you know the speed versus risk

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,840
mitigation aspects

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,880
so uh you know in conjunction with you

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
know people

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,280
processes we're also throwing more tools

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,520
you know to make sure that the

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,440
management and the you know development

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,199
of software is done you know without

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,560
compromising any of our

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,000
you know risk vectors great thank you

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,520
um you mentioned this idea of running

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,520
the open source program office as a

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,360
service um what

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
so what problems do you see that is

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,160
solving and

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,080
sort of what are the benefits versus

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,319
other structures for

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,919
so the one thing that i've learned

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,680
working in big enterprises is that

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,160
everything is about money right

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,560
so so the thing is like open source

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
program office is a cost to the company

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
so if you don't sell it as a service

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,759
internally in a company

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,240
uh there no one would like to host that

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,639
program office in their office but if

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
you expand that program office across

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,720
all business unit the cost going to

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,599
reduce so that's that's what i i

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
see that it will resolve and once you

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,599
once we can show that

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
progress every business unit would love

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
to own

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
program office because it's not costing

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
them anything

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
it's just like providing service

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,560
internally

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,759
yeah let me reflect on a little bit so

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,919
we chatted before

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
and i really like the idea of a open

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,879
source program offices

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,280
as a service offering essentially in an

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
organization i'll tell you

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,479
every client we've worked with said we

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
are the most highly federated and

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,160
distributed organization

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
you know that you've ever worked with in

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
in your past like i've heard

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
that at the beginning of every single

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
time i engage with the client

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,760
you're all distributed you're all highly

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,880
federated so the notion of

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159
a ospo as a shared service that's one

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
way to approach that

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,440
that notion of federated organization

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
but the other piece i want to

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,519
want to point out when i talked about

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,480
metrics earlier on it's

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,320
it is it can be pure overhead but it

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,279
doesn't that doesn't mean that that

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
you can't track it as uh as a positive

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,160
cost center essentially

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
that's why i encourage you to bring in

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,720
bring in hr hr knows the metrics for

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,720
retaining and recruiting developers

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
and an open source program office should

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
make

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,279
should improve through the programs they

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,480
bring to an organization should be able

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,360
to improve

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,040
developer retention and and recruitment

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
and hr knows those statistics pretty

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,920
darn well

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
so if you can cut developer return i

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,320
mean if you can improve developer

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
retention by 20

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
or reduce the cost of developer

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
recruitment by 10

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
those are hard hard dollar numbers that

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
you can apply to to the

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
the effect of the open source program

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
office and there are seven or eight or

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
nine different metrics that you can use

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,720
like that to show the value

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,640
of a program office great uh morally

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
you're in the office of the cto at wells

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,200
fargo i take it that's where

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
the open source program is centered as

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,360
well

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,959
um what how how did it come to be there

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
and and then i'd like to hear your

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
thoughts and then i guess moving this

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,920
way the other panelists on

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
where the right location for an open

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,200
source program is within an enterprise

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,839
yeah wells fargo historically you know

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,279
we were

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,839
highly federated so no different than

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
many of

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,839
our you know competitors as well but

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,720
with the formation of the cto office

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
we uh you know have uh you know created

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
a central charter

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
to simplify and rationalize technology

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,360
right i think one of the things that

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
we looked at was this concept of a value

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
stream right how do we really

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,200
decompose our technology strategy into

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
you know a couple of dozen value streams

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
and value streams

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,079
you know is just a a managed service

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,079
right

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,079
when you think about you know your

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,200
software development experience

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,519
uh your open source channel is one of

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
the

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,839
you know sources that really drives the

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
creation of value within the company

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,200
now you know what we did was we

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
integrated

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,040
the supply chain function which used to

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
really perform

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,480
all of the risk mitigation with regards

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,040
to procuring open source

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,880
and pad it up with all of the ci cd

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,440
missionaries so for example

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,200
you know it's very common you know for

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,519
applications to bring in

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
you know binaries through our dependency

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
you know resolvers

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
uh so what we you know did was how do we

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,279
really pad up

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
the open source license verification

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,320
with the dependent zero solution so that

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,880
the developer

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,880
who's really looking to you know create

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
value on top of existing open source

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
products can

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,920
proceed without really having to deal

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,880
with a lot of friction and resistance in

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
the enterprise

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,360
so that is you know where we really see

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
in the yield because we really need to

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
be

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,279
thoughtful about you know how do we

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
really bring the legal perspective the

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,880
architecture perspective the security

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,040
perspective the developer perspective

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
and tie it all into the machinery so at

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
the end of the day

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
the developer can actually do what they

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
really want they are not

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,440
you know uh you know too fond of

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
spending too much time understanding all

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
these nuances they just want this to

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,279
work

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
and what we really need to do from the

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,200
cto office is

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
you know make the machinery such that

00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,760
they are thoughtful

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
you know in understanding what it is

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920
that they want to do but at the same

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
time

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,240
you know accelerate you know the the

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600
velocity of software

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,279
so if i hear you right you're sort of

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,560
sitting in the center of all of these

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,480
other other departments and

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,320
um you know bringing together their

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,880
concerns while also acting as a

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,360
as an advocate for developers yeah i

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
mean

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
one of the classic examples that you

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,959
know we've talked about it before

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,079
which is if you curated all of the

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,760
open source software that you requested

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
and if you went through the thoughtful

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,000
process of sourcing them

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
and inventorying them the fact of the

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,120
matter is

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,160
when you sit down and write software

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
today

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,480
whether it is javascript or python or

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,120
java or c-sharp

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,240
the fact is that you know you resolve

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
your dependencies

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,760
to a big graph of software that is

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,639
really sourced in the source forges of

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,720
the world

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
so you really need to make sure that as

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,480
you resolve all of your dependencies

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
you're not really compromising

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
what has really been established from a

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,839
firm standard best practice on what is

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,079
really okay

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,880
and that is where we actually see

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,079
opportunity to speed things up right so

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,560
great thank you where is the right place

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,279
to to host an open office and are you

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,519
doing it

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,480
so basically so when i started as an

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,240
engineer i thought

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
engineering was the best place to host

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
it then i did

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
legal degree so i thought legal is the

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,360
best place to do it

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,079
so i so i basically don't know so the

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,800
thing is it's

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,880
depending on different organization

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,399
where whichever works for you but i

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,040
think that for a big enterprise the ospo

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,920
has to be a separate organization

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
with stakeholders from every department

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,399
in that

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
and then when you have something like

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,800
that you have

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
you can scale it to each and every

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
business unit

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
whether you create it as a service you

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,560
give them for free it's depending on

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,279
how you want to do it but but i think it

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
has to be

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,839
a separate organization giving service

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,959
to everyone it should not be inside any

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
engineering order

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,720
thank you andrew you've seen this done

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,720
differently across

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,839
many of your customers presumably what

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,880
what have you seen work and

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,279
not in in fail uh well

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,639
do we have lawyers in the room i have a

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,720
master's uh

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
a couple okay sorry don't put it in

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
legal

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,600
all right don't put it in legal legal

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,600
has a really really important role

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:38,079
to to play or marketing

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,079
let less concern there but i agree to me

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,000
legal has a really important and and

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,680
critical and foundational role to play

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,880
in a program office

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,639
but housing the ospo in or under the

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
auspices of legal sends the wrong

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,120
message

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
to the developer community at the end of

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
the day you have to have their

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
their buy-in right because no matter

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,320
what kind of a governance or compliance

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,600
process you put in place

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,000
there are always ways to work around it

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
and just being in legal really does send

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
the wrong message

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,079
so we typically recommend uh depending

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
on the org

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,120
we're talking to find this is financial

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,519
services vertical right so

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
notion of if you have a centralized uh

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,720
it or shared

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,079
i.t group shared services i.t group

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,920
that's the right place

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,000
central architecture group that can be

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,560
the right place

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,920
so that's that's my opinion great um

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,199
so you know i think like as

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
someone mentioned on stage earlier i

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,240
think it was russell green at db

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,440
um you know while this whole process

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,600
of becoming conversant with

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
and and getting on top of the open

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
source situation

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,480
feels like a new thing in financial

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,199
services um it's

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
it's um it's something that many other

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,920
industries have

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,120
have gone through the same process and

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
and it seems like

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,279
you know as as an enterprise becomes

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,199
aware of the issue

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,880
you know the first focus is always on

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,399
compliance and then

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
you know slowly it moves toward how

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,199
should we be participating how should we

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,040
be contributing

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,600
how can we be collaborating with our

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,600
peers in the open source community

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,519
how i'd like to hear from our panelists

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
how how you see

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,160
you know what are strategies for for

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,399
making that change within your own

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
culture within your own practices from a

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
compliance focus toward

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
a more outward facing how do we how do

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,040
we make the most of this

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
uh strategically andrew you can go first

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,720
we'll go back

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
the other time that's a good that's a

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,199
really essential question

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,399
so typically when we get engaged

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,399
the first thing to do is go through

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,519
triage there's usually

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,160
you know there's usually a a perceived

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
issue okay around compliance whatever

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,959
that might be

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
license compliance or ip leakage or

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,399
whatever you want to call it

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,560
so the first part is is typically triage

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,480
let's figure out one

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
it's usually a perceived as opposed to a

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,519
real problem but that doesn't matter in

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,880
the minds of the stakeholders so you

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
still have to treat it like a real

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
problem

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,760
so address that figure out what the

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
compliance and the governance regime

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,959
looks like

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,640
help them address immediate concerns and

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,559
then we typically recommend working on

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,480
kind of three three elements at the same

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,079
time one building you're

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,760
trying to build a lowest common

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
denominator holistic enterprise wide

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,520
open

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
source strategy a lot of big words there

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
together but it doesn't have to be a

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,120
huge exercise

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,319
right then it also recognize that policy

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,120
and process

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,640
are two separate tax or tracks and need

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,039
to be addressed separately

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,240
work on a policy first really that that

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,000
and and there's

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,520
there's no policy for no matter how

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
complex an organization you are that

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,600
should be

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
worst case what more than 12 pages long

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,240
okay

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
and it should be less then you figure

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
out how to instantiate that policy

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
in a set of processes so that it's it's

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
not just pure

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,000
overhead to your developers again

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
because then you're not going to get buy

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
in

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
and while you're going through that then

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,600
work on the strategy

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
how are we going to implement it how are

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,280
we moving from a contributor

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,960
i mean from a consumer to a contributor

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,520
to even a publisher of open source

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
and why are we doing this yeah great so

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,080
run at fnc

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,919
yeah i think for a company like fnc was

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,160
totally proprietary four or five years

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,559
ago now we started using open source

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,640
the biggest uh thing i think which is

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,480
required is the education

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,080
like com people who've been working in

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,960
that company doesn't

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,600
really know how to work with open source

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
uh

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,320
like you need to educate them on license

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,160
compliance security

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,600
there are there is export compliance

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,520
that you need to educate

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
and once you start contributing back you

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,400
need to educate them on the

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,880
clas that you need to sign

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
and how to basically the code of conduct

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,760
uh you go

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,360
and uh work with the different

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
communities so i think

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,039
education which is gonna be like uh

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,200
forever

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,799
that we need to educate everyone but uh

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,679
i think to start of it

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
that we should focus on that too on the

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
education

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,080
of all our developers yeah i mean i

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,960
think i would add to that

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,200
you know fundamentally the uh you know

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,160
the the thought process involved in

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,760
reviewing what is it that you want to

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,880
consume and what are the terms and

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,919
conditions

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
with which you can consume is you know

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,120
something that we've really done very

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,880
well we have

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,720
you know used a combination of human

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,679
capital plus tools to get that thing

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,400
solved

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,400
but the reality here is that this is not

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
a world that stays still right

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
so what was approved you know two years

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,400
ago you know

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,960
or even two months ago uh may be

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,160
changing

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,799
so you really need to have the means to

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,720
respond to real-time changes to the

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,480
licensing terms etc

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,240
and bring that awareness to the

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,559
developer community because

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,520
you may really be you know operating

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,360
under the model

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,039
you know that you reviewed based on

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,640
three months ago or six months ago and

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,720
that doesn't really cut it

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,919
it's almost like you know having the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,520
pulse on the wire

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,000
and being able to do this all the time

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,120
which is why you know even between you

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,840
doing development

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,280
versus you deploying something into

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,679
production setting

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
we have plenty of safety nets in place

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,240
to make sure that you don't really put

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
the bank across

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,520
which is very important you really need

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,200
to make sure that you really have the

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,280
checks and balances to

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
say hey you know you did this you know

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,280
with a conservative posture

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,080
but you really need to get a lot more

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,960
preventative

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,559
as you really mature into the qa and uat

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
and broad stages etc

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,480
so you need to feel really confident in

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
your processes internally

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
on the consumption side before you

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,880
before you feel exactly ready to open up

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,400
i see that uh well our panelists have

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
really answered the call to concision

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
here i

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
um i think we have time for a couple of

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
questions from the audience if anyone

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,840
would like to uh

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
to pull our panelists

00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:03,840
sir so you talk about the

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,840
open source

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,640
i'd agree that was that was an omission

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,280
of my part they have they're absolutely

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,320
critical

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,840
as an element of a program office and

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,600
recognize that as a program office

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,320
doesn't have to be ten full-time people

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,280
even for the largest organizations right

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,960
it can be

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
a number of people half-time in

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,120
half-time rolls

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,039
uh so it really just depends on on your

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,120
your particular operating model but

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,760
security has to be a part of it

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
i was going to say you know i was with

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,720
another

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,760
large bank in my prior life

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,039
one of the things that we recognized was

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,720
some of the source forges that you

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,520
go to to procure software you know

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,840
unless you really vet them on you know

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
how rigorous their processes are

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,919
for publishing software into their

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,080
forges you could really have

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,919
you know situations like trojan horses

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,280
where you are thinking that you're

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,600
really getting your comment

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,039
logging utility and lo and behold you

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,200
brought in something

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,640
that puts your you know institution at

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
risk so

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,039
you know you have to be very thorough in

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
terms of vetting

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
you know or white listing these

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
repositories from which you

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,720
you know procure software and you can't

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
really you know take the brand name and

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,760
then say hey

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,200
you know that seems to be okay and then

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
you know take comfort on it

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,120
you really need to continuously validate

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,280
on whether you really saw

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,200
abnormalities in the way you know you

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,640
resolved it and what exactly were the

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,640
ingredients that you brought into the

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,039
farm

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,520
and i think you're addressing to me

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,320
that's a part of the role of what a

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
program office should help figure out

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,919
and decide

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,280
yeah that you know that's one one key

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,120
consideration right there

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,360
yeah do you scan an ingestion do you

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,039
scan pre-production post-production

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,120
you know there's a whole host of of

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,000
questions that the program office should

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,400
be addressing

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
yeah one of the things that we realized

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,120
as we

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
you know fleshed out the value stream

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,480
thinking was

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
we identified value streams like you

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,080
know site reliability engineering

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
resiliency cyber security core banking

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
etc

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,960
but when you think about it

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
fundamentally you really want to be able

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,159
to say

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
what is the behavior that you really see

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,640
for your software and production

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,159
how exactly were they developed in the

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,559
early stages of formation

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,400
and you want to have a tight correlation

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,440
if you don't have that tight correlation

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
whether you call it

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,960
you know address it through cyber

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,840
security or sre resiliency it's the same

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,440
problem

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,279
you need to have in a complete

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
traceability on what was you know going

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,240
into your source code repository and

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,279
what exactly was really running in

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
production

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,000
you you absolutely need that you know to

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,480
protect your phone

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,480
well our time is up i think a 25-minute

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,320
panel on a topic this broad is

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,559
something of a conference extreme sport

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,000
but i think our panelists did a

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,520
terrific job of bringing out some of the

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
most important issues so thank you to

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:19,840
all of our panelists for joining us

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:19,840
today thank you

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,799
