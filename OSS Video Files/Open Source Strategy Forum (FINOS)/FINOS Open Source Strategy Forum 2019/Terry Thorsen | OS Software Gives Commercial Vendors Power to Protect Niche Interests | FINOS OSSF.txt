	Terry Thorsen  | Cosaic | How Open Source Software Gives Commercial Vendors the Power to Protect Niche Interests | FINOS OSSF 2019

Terry Thorsen, Co-Founder & CTO, Cosaic

Major open source projects that we all depend upon, like Chromium and Electron, are managed by a small set of individuals who work for west coast technology firms. As big as the multinational banks are, their technology departments don't have the bandwidth or focus to ensure that their interests will be considered as those projecte evolve. Vendors like us—though small—represent the entire finance industry, and because of our focus have the ability to stay tuned in with those projects.

As such, we can ensure that the needs of our constituents are considered in the evolution of those open source projects. This talk discusses this relationship and what it means when small commercial vendors have the power of influence in fintech open-source projects.
