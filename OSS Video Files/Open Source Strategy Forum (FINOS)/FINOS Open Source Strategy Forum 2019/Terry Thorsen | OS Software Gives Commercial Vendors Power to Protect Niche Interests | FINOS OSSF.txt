	Terry Thorsen  | Cosaic | How Open Source Software Gives Commercial Vendors the Power to Protect Niche Interests | FINOS OSSF 2019

Terry Thorsen, Co-Founder & CTO, Cosaic

Major open source projects that we all depend upon, like Chromium and Electron, are managed by a small set of individuals who work for west coast technology firms. As big as the multinational banks are, their technology departments don't have the bandwidth or focus to ensure that their interests will be considered as those projecte evolve. Vendors like us—though small—represent the entire finance industry, and because of our focus have the ability to stay tuned in with those projects.

As such, we can ensure that the needs of our constituents are considered in the evolution of those open source projects. This talk discusses this relationship and what it means when small commercial vendors have the power of influence in fintech open-source projects.

Terry Thorsen's BIO

[Music]

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,380
thank you for joining me today I'm gonna

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,689
talk about this cleverly worded topic

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,310
how open source software gives

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,949
commercial vendors the power to protect

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,320
niche interests we didn't have time to

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,099
wordsmith that down to five words but it

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,120
tells you what I'm gonna talk about I'm

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,850
the co-founder chief technologist of

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,260
chart IQ we're a company that builds

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,940
financial technology software primarily

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,800
in the html5 space I I'm gonna start

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,940
this talk by talking a little bit about

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,370
my career and how I got to the point

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,969
where open source was relevant and

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,469
important to what we do and then that'll

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,350
lead to some insights that I hope to

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,489
convey to you I've spent my entire

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,580
career in financial technology as a

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,439
technologist a programmer but my career

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,860
can roughly be broken into two parts the

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,509
first part was with a company called

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,130
automated financial systems that I

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:23,700
co-founded and we were sort of we came

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,840
out of the dot-com boom that supernova

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,310
that spun off a million companies and we

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,939
we built financial technology software

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,890
online trading systems and that company

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,420
was eventually bought by SunGard now FIS

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,100
they bought it in 2006 worked for

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,770
SunGard for a couple of years and then I

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:52,860
decided I needed to take a break so in

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:54,810
2008 I stopped I stopped coding I did a

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,110
bunch of things I had a few children

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:02,610
I grew organic tomatoes thus the the

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,560
picture here I decided I had a nice plot

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,989
of land at Virginia where I lived and I

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,640
felt really bad about not using that

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,080
property to do anything so I'm like I'm

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,230
gonna grow some Tomatoes

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,600
and over one summer I sold tomatoes at

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,140
the farmers market I sold two hundred

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,890
and twenty-five dollars or the tomatoes

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:28,440
the entire summer which may not sound

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,650
like a lot until you consider that

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,270
tomatoes cost about 25 cents each and

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,780
that I was only probably able to move

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,240
about 20% of tomatoes I grew that summer

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:47,010
taught me more about customers than the

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:51,000
previous 12 years in FinTech in 2000 and

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,640
around 2011-2012 my friends intervened

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,770
with this situation they didn't like the

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,450
fact that I wasn't writing software the

00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,430
first intervention was when I got a

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,400
package in the mail and it came

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,210
contained this thing I didn't know what

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,580
it was

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,170
I hadn't really been paying attention I

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,500
started going like this with it trying

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,360
to make it work I looked inside there

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,270
was a note from my friend who said hey

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,590
this thing came out it's changing the

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,700
world you need to get your head out of

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,600
the garden okay I'll take a look at this

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,700
the next thing I kept up a

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,850
correspondence with a former colleague

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,010
from SunGard a fellow architect and he

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,410
had been tailing me tell me about this

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,880
inclination of five I was like whatever

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,170
I felt one two three four I'm paid

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,060
attention that he says no this is all

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,470
different they you can do anything now

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,630
he says remember when you tried to build

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,430
stock charts with Dom elements and like

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,700
they're too slow there's this thing

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,920
called the html5 canvas all right I kind

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,600
of registered this is a what I call my

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,510
golden age emails is a little bit later

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,830
where I realized that we were in a

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,920
golden age of software these are things

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,010
that we had railed about in 2008 we

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,330
didn't want to use relational databases

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,950
and they were gone me and Ballia Paris

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,240
stores Redis and had appeared I

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,320
hated dealing with server racks and all

00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,180
of a sudden everything was in the cloud

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,260
JSON had killed the wisdom JavaScript I

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,910
could run on the server to have to

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,090
switch back and forth we in C++ or Java

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:23,280
and JavaScript and then dynamic web apps

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,930
had replaced GUI apps almost Mike's

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,970
response was thank God we never had to

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,830
grok a whistle for real

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,470
so it's a good time to get back into

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,120
software and then the last thing that

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,569
happened is this this this guy showed up

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:41,340
on my doorstep dan who I'd known for

00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,750
many many years I admired him and we had

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,129
worked together very very briefly I

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,479
thought he was very entrepreneurial but

00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,719
for whatever reason decided to go

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,419
corporate for like a dozen years finally

00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:52,770
I one day he had fed up with you know

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,050
his boss

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,580
and said he was ready to start a

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,789
business and all he want to do is

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,940
visualization and but he did have a

00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:04,500
developer and so he asked me like what

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,259
I've been doing and so I pulled up my

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,690
iPad with a html5 canvas talk chart on

00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,159
it cuz I couldn't help myself and he

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,129
said oh that's visualization let's go

00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:18,090
into business selling this so I knew

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,830
where that was gonna gonna land and I

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:26,729
knew that somehow like 10 years later

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:29,159
I'd be standing here this is our chart

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,560
right so I mean this the the greatest

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,229
thing for us was when Yahoo Finance

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,710
decided to use our charts and the

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:39,120
software that that we wrote is now being

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,500
used by millions and millions of people

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,440
every single day this is where I took

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,120
time off to raise Tomatoes and you know

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,800
like the one lesson here sometimes

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,400
timing is more important than execution

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,279
so when I got back things had changed

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,870
pretty significantly in software we we

00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,150
got to writing software we got back to

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,849
selling software and then we finally got

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,069
around to selling to the enterprise and

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,099
I was shocked

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,719
when I left in 2008 I was doing

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,250
waterfall the way they just named it

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,009
waterfall you know but part of that it

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,080
was just called software development we

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,039
had my previous company had done mean

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,389
right extreme programming and you know

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,099
we were kind of mocked and got some eye

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,349
rolls from the enterprise when we talked

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,210
about this but here we were in 2012 and

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:33,270
everyone is suddenly switched to agile

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,639
they were doing scrum couldn't believe

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,190
it but it was true

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,020
when we left in 2008 it was all j2ee

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,660
that's what the enterprise was about

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,780
he's big honking pieces of metal running

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,510
big honking pieces of infrastructure and

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,970
now it was angular and soon to be react

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,640
at the time so everything had shifted

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,530
from the server over to client and

00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,580
shifted over from you know happy

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,590
traditional languages to JavaScript and

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,900
what sort of the most interesting thing

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,820
that had changed is that the the status

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,890
of the developer themselves had changed

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,780
when I left in 2008 we were still

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,400
wearing ties but essentially the

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,190
developers and the enterprise were

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,780
sometimes the lowest-ranking status

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,500
people in the company they did what they

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,970
were told it was top-down management and

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,580
they were off in the corner with their

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,920
big white boxes coding them and then

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,960
smashing them when they got angry and

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,570
when I got back it was a whole different

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,180
scenario at the programmers had taken

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,350
over the enterprise and I don't know

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,070
what happened like the explosion of

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:40,920
software just got too much for you know

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,420
the management and they kind of just

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,270
handed over the keys to the software

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,740
guys that here you know you kind of run

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,330
the show and so now when we look in the

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,430
enterprise software developers are

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,470
unbelievably empowered and they're often

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,340
driving some of the business initiatives

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,310
the other thing that change pretty

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:03,240
dramatic was the role of open source at

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:06,630
the enterprise in 2008 when I left this

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,650
was what epitomized open source for

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,380
those that you guys don't know that's

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,510
Richard Stallman from the Free Software

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,220
Foundation whose utopian dream of

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,690
socialist software threatened the very

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,850
nature of capitalism RedHat were the

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,850
guys that came to the rescue by

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,740
legitimizing open source for the

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,800
enterprise and MySQL was one of the

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,890
things that stood out as this glorious

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,330
thing that corporations would never

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:38,910
tarnish and get involved with and the

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:40,380
future of open-source when I got back

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,440
open source is a whole different crowd

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,080
right it was angular it was chrome it

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
was node the folks that were getting

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,820
involved now were the big West Coast

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,360
firms it was Google

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,010
it was react

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,570
eventually even Microsoft got into it

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:02,390
you know giving us type scripts and

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:05,300
Visual Studio code so open source had

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,070
really dramatically changed to give you

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,890
a sense of how dramatic this change was

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,190
in 2006 when we sold our company we'd

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,339
use the new string library in our

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,860
software completely kosher was LGPL you

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,230
could freely use it link it into your

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,110
software but it was just too damn scary

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,459
for the lawyers and so before we could

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,040
sell the company we had to spend an

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,870
entire month rewriting our software to

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,829
use the standard C++ string library

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,230
thank you you're on if you're here now

00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:38,120
the typical enterprise their portfolio

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,790
they have hundreds of applications that

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,620
have hundreds of NPM dependencies they

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,329
get loaded really with not very much

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,420
thought there's some automated systems

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:47,870
to check for vulnerabilities but that's

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,720
about it

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,589
the enterprise is permeated with open

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,370
source the implications are generally

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,550
good right

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,010
open source is a good move we're getting

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,170
more stuff done but it's not all bad and

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,970
we're a bed of roses it's at best

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:11,449
jumping from the fire into the frying

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:15,529
pan so to think about like what the

00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:20,810
benefits of open source are it helps to

00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:22,399
think a little bit about what the how we

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,170
think about open source and one of the

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,550
things that come to mind the first thing

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,160
that comes to mind is that open source

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,699
is free and maybe this is why the

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,500
enterprise is using open source but I

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:36,320
don't think that the cost of software

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,360
was really ever a significant hurdle for

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,089
the enterprise the cost of commercial

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,279
license of software is you know it's a

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,769
rounding error

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:50,060
typically enterprises have incredible

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:52,519
buying power it wasn't a cost that drove

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,519
the companies to open source and in fact

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,630
again just a quote red you know red hat

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,130
we know that companies will pay an

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,190
enormous amount of money for reliability

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,480
and predictability so it's not free then

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,300
maybe it's because it's transparent

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,680
right we used to trust commercial

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,280
software because we trusted the profit

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,480
motive

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,860
right it was just an 8 now we say we

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,480
trust open source because it's

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,800
transparent we can see inside we know

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,140
what's going on

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,570
but the reality is like how often have

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,760
you actually looked inside of your open

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,740
source software it's a a check that is

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,500
doing what you need to do to understand

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:31,520
it how many of your NPM dependencies

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,560
have you forked the reality is that we

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,000
do trust open source word software but

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,270
it's kind of like a herd mentality we

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,130
trust it because everyone's using it

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:47,240
particularly the the big boys out there

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:50,870
in the West Coast the shift here in

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,270
trust is pretty dramatic when when I

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:58,400
left in 2008 we couldn't sell software

00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,320
without a deep code on it and now I you

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,770
know I can count on one finger and half

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,900
a finger

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,970
how many code audits our software's has

00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,860
gone through even though it's playing a

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,390
really significant role and iterating

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,740
much deeper into the enterprise than

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,060
anything that I'd built my previous

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:19,010
company so if free and transparent

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:21,470
aren't the reasons what is and it's it's

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,450
actually pretty straightforward and

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:27,500
driessen's fave famous quote software is

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,810
eating the world open-source has more

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,120
developers writing more code producing

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,700
more value and this is just more stuff

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,450
you know if we go back to C++ and Java

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,339
days if you needed something and the

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,110
standard library couldn't accommodate it

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,660
you're off hunting for commercial

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,910
library likely not finding it and ending

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,310
up dy and DIY eyeing it having to do it

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,660
yourself so we're really really slow I

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,339
mean it took a long time to build things

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,630
and we built a lot of infrastructure and

00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,970
there's a lot of redundancy from firm to

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,820
firm to firm nowadays if you need to do

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:01,850
something there's a 90% chance that it

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,580
already exists it's in JavaScript it's

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,320
instantly available the ubiquity and

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,390
instantaneousness of open-source

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,120
software particularly javascript is

00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,040
what's allowing it to eat the world so

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,200
this is all great right but what's the

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,240
rub and the rub is what if your open

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,209
source library doesn't do what you need

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,810
it to again going back to commercial

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,430
vendors

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,250
you could trust the profit motive when

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,890
the enterprise told a commercial vendor

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,560
to jump the response was how high and

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,840
then here's the bill

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,940
getting stuff changed in the open-source

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,370
community is a very different endeavor

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,260
and there's a couple ways that typically

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,150
we try to go about it so the first

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:46,460
obvious way is you know fork the code

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:49,279
and this is just frankly a terrible idea

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,870
to fork the code it takes an enormous

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,360
amount of hubris to think that you can

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,570
take someone else's software download it

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,610
make the changes that you want to it and

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,589
then have it run reliably like if you

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,820
know you went to Oracle and said oh we

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,080
need Oracle to change how its

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,310
transaction management works and they

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,760
said here's the source code go ahead

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,660
like would you trust that it's really

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,550
just a mint doesn't make a lot of sense

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,120
it takes an enormous amount of time to

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,620
understand code and to safely modify it

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,440
if you add to that the fact that open

00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,960
source code is notorious for lack of

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,410
commenting for lack of a Thor attain of

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,460
style it's really a major endeavor and

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,600
then of course once you fork the code

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,280
you have to maintain it

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,810
it's a ton of work and then you end up

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,910
losing the benefit of community and you

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,800
have to make this decision constantly

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,190
about how to reemerge your code back in

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,060
it's not a great idea the next thing

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,770
that you're going to try to do is you

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,210
can try to convince the maintainer that

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:48,170
the source code to make the changes for

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,210
you and of course you know that's easier

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,190
said than done your change may not be

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,440
what other peoples want what other

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,050
people want it may be what they want but

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,970
the container is just the the maintainer

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,550
don't have time to do it more than

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,620
likely gonna say hey it's a great idea

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,360
can you submit a PR and then we'll merge

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,220
it in so you're right back to square one

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,890
having to understand the code having to

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,510
write it and at best now maybe you have

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:16,870
a code reviewer to do to help you there

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:19,520
so really we're back in the same boat of

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,070
third-party software that we may need to

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,980
get changed except now I can't actually

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,470
pay someone to do it I have only my wits

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,480
and charm to get that done this is not

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,980
great for the capital markets industry

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,100
and the reality is we are too busy

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,870
writing

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,690
software is eating the world our

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,699
developers should be working on business

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,769
logic not on infrastructure and open

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:44,389
sources larger infrastructure that every

00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,620
single firm every single bank every

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,180
single brokerage every single asset

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,269
manager they all need the same thing it

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,220
doesn't make sense for them to do that

00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:54,589
so this opens up the opportunity for a

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,940
new type of commercial veteran so vendor

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,860
like our company there are other

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,730
companies who are presenting that are in

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,889
a sort of similar domain I think red hat

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,440
was the original sort of pioneer in this

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:09,949
they took open source software they

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,380
commercialized it and they made it

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:14,089
palatable for the enterprise and if you

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,980
look at any major piece of sort of

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,870
infrastructural software like kubernetes

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,889
or Postgres you're gonna find commercial

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,350
vendors that are supporting that

00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:23,300
software and adding value and of course

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,009
there's instances like and docker

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:31,630
where the whole company is based around

00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:35,120
that model in the case of what we're

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,579
supporting it's its electron the use

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,660
case that we support is what we call

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:43,939
desktop interrupts and this is brand-new

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,259
to a large portion of the community and

00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:49,790
if you haven't seen it before I'm gonna

00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:52,790
attempt to just show you real quick this

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,800
on one of these monitors here so the

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,910
first thing that it is is a different

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,939
form factor so here I am totally hapless

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,679
with powerpoints you've got a browser

00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:08,630
window but it's a tiny little thing and

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,650
we have little menus and stuff that we

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:18,020
can click on here so this is a brand new

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:21,799
form factor for the browser whoa I can

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,270
do that there we go for the browser and

00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,530
we're protecting this within the

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,809
electronic community this is not a

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,100
standard way to deliver an electron app

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:33,110
it uses frameless windows it's a

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,270
completely different way of thinking

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,549
about electron software Skype and

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,530
Spotify and Visual Studio code that are

00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,000
based on electron don't have this use

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,179
case so we're in there protecting that

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,580
use case through lobbying and discussion

00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,590
and education

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,990
the second thing that we're very focused

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,020
on is security we want to be able to

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,530
integrate third-party applications the

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,310
the financial services workspace

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,940
involves many many third-party

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:03,070
applications being integrated electron

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,230
is not focused on this most against

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,580
modify slack the visual studio one

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,550
they're not incorporating third-party

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,740
content and applications electrons

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,290
capable of doing it we're there to help

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,240
them focus and make sure that they

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,240
maintain that and are focused on it

00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,570
performance right our use case that has

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,850
multiple applications running

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,800
simultaneously again is a novel use of

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:31,150
electron so we're ensuring that the

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,790
parts of the electron API that are

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:38,350
focused on performance are maintained

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,880
it's interesting that you know in the

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,780
enterprise where you're there buying

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,890
hardware on a large scale often the

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,270
performance characteristics of the

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,640
machines are less than what you would

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,990
have at home on your laptop so it's a

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,170
significant concern to the enterprise

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,500
and then finally reliability and

00:18:53,170 --> 00:19:01,570
predictability the software that we're

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,140
building is replacing software that's in

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,360
Java

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,180
that's a C++ we recently replaced a

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,970
delphi system so we're replacing code

00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,610
that's been in production on desktops

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,640
for ten fifteen twenty-five years in the

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:18,310
case of the Delphi soft software there's

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,620
no reason to expect that this wave of

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:22,330
JavaScript desktop software isn't also

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,270
going to be on the desktop for ten or

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,950
fifteen years that's not typically how

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,210
people think about JavaScript software

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,920
or building web software

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,040
it's web software is disposable it's

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,470
like a three year cycle so this concept

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,820
of billing so enterprise-grade

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,190
javascript javascript for the long term

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,960
is really a new thing and it's something

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,700
that we're very focused on to make sure

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:49,210
that the longevity is there in that

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:51,250
project so we're doing these things the

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,800
question is how do we go about doing

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,270
that and it's helpful to start by

00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,590
understanding there are several

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,200
different classes of open-source

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,140
software the one we think about

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:08,530
most often as the individual champion

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:10,780
you know a guy or girl in her bedroom at

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,309
night over the keyboard building some

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,530
really cool stuff we actually have a guy

00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,110
working for us who built an incredible

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,360
piece of software called osmosis totally

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,790
supported by him used by thousands of

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,020
thousands of people

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:26,020
he doesn't need a commercial vendor to

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:29,049
come in and help him d3 is a great

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,370
example d3 was built by the fellow who's

00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,010
in charge of infographics for the new

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,980
york times he built it in order to help

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:40,120
him and his job became ubiquitous in the

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,980
industry for infographics but again it's

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,190
supported by him and a small cadre of

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,260
people it's not a place where a

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:52,360
commercial vendor really needs to help

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:54,600
anyone use it corporate overlord is the

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,650
one that we're getting more used to

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,960
we've got Facebook supporting react

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,460
we've got an angular Google supporting

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,860
chromium and angular we've got Microsoft

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,530
supporting typescript you know a few

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:10,120
years ago still have Oracle supporting

00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:12,070
Java again you know they're they're

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,830
doing a good job they're helping spread

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,360
this benefit to the world there's not

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,100
really much need for commercial vendor

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,330
to come in and add like enterprise great

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,669
react it's already Enterprise great

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,010
because it's been built by these mega

00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:25,510
companies but there's a class where a

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,490
commercial vendor really makes some

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,010
sense the one we're most familiar with

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,600
is the corporate monetize er Red Hat I

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:37,240
talked about Redis MySQL docker

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,830
these companies that are building open

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,179
source software releasing an open source

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:45,130
but then monetizing it another great

00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:48,370
type of open source software is the

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,650
foundational overseer finis here as one

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,210
example I think the Apache group is the

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,490
one that you know is sort of world

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,600
famous this is a great place for a

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,370
commercial vendor to get involved

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,309
because it's highly structured it's

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,049
committee driven it is primarily for

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:03,820
commercial interests I think Apache is

00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:06,910
sort of split commercial and academic

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,640
interests but it's a place where

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:12,210
corporations can come in play a role in

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,880
a very structured way and a very

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,980
official way and then the last one you

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,220
know I've kind of coined this this

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,050
corporate co-op of which electron is one

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,570
it's sort of an oddball but I think

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,150
Linux was like this too where there

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:30,120
isn't a single corporate Overlord there

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:33,630
is no oversight by a foundation it is

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,310
literally a cooperative of several

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,080
companies who have an interest in this

00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:42,030
working as peers to support the software

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,620
and this is a place where a commercial

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,500
vendor like ours can play a major role

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,320
in making sure that our customers have a

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,040
voice in what's going on there and even

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,380
a small company like ourselves can

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,980
represent an entire industry that is

00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:04,350
just as relevant as Google or slack who

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,820
are in there and using it so working an

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,260
open-source the first thing you need to

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,910
understand is that it's social a very

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,060
open source project is a community of

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,400
individuals projects have cultures they

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,100
have hierarchy they have rules that are

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,950
spoken and unspoken they have processes

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,870
they have needs and weaknesses so it's

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,300
important to understand how to behave in

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,880
the open-source community in order to be

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,010
effective the first sort of surprising

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,710
thing to a lot of folks is that altruism

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,300
actually prevails the greater good is

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,910
the main driver of most open-source

00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,460
software even the ones with kopanova

00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,590
corporate overlords and I think this is

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,490
because developers are cooperative by

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,650
nature

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:51,270
we're driven by the need to improve not

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:52,890
the need to compete so you know

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,270
generally you know when you get into the

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,990
open source community you could leave

00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,210
your competitive instincts at the door

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,820
credibility is essential right if you

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,770
want to get the attention of the

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,050
maintainer xand get their assistance you

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,460
have to be asking and form questions you

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:13,280
have to demonstrate in understanding the

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:16,410
projects you it's okay to bring a view

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,850
in fact use cases and industry views are

00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:22,220
welcome in open source projects

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,510
legitimate use cases are highly valued

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,789
and companies can participate at the

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,259
scope is right but they have to

00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,330
straight that they're not just in there

00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:31,669
- you know wham bam I want to get a

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:34,340
change and then they're out and then

00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:36,859
finally social capital is currency in

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,019
open source open source projects are

00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,970
higher go blind Eicher but that

00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:44,600
hierarchy is based on participation so

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:46,429
it was very fluid those who contribute

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,039
the most care of the most are given the

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:51,499
most authority and responsibility

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,330
when you think about it spending your

00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:54,999
time working on open source even if it's

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,549
for company is sort of an inheritable

00:24:54,999 --> 00:25:01,039
charitable exercise and I think in those

00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:02,299
sort of altruistic communities a great

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,139
deal of respect is given to those who

00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:07,940
contribute the most so you know the way

00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:09,799
that a company can act as a good partner

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,799
is simply to match the goals of

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,779
open-source itself if you think about

00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,609
open source contributors the thing that

00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,649
most motivates them is bringing their

00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:22,359
vision to life they want to see their

00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:26,059
code out there being used helping people

00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:28,309
changing lives and being a part of the

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:30,529
everyday everyday world and then the

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,739
second thing is permanence is I wrote a

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:36,919
little open-source back in like 1993 and

00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:41,090
I was so surprised to find my comments

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,099
in iOS code in like 2010 it had just

00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,139
hopped around over and over and over

00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:47,419
again and there's a really great sense

00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:49,519
when you experience that sort of

00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,769
permanence and I think that's something

00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,929
that they're all after so we dedicate

00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:58,239
time we dedicate knowledge we did a

00:25:53,929 --> 00:26:00,619
commitment and we dedicate involvement

00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:02,359
but back to you know what's the question

00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:04,789
are you open source shouldn't it be free

00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,899
it's it's here we are saying well you

00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:08,509
want to pay a commercial vendor where

00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:12,950
this Red Hat whether it's charter cubes

00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:14,779
and sambal shouldn't it be free well

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,340
there's an elephant in a room about open

00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:18,019
source which is who's paying for these

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,539
developers developers are

00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:21,889
extraordinarily expensive and the

00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:24,019
reality is if you look at almost any

00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:26,509
open-source project the developers are

00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:29,239
being paid by the corporations that make

00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:33,320
use of the open source software in order

00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:35,570
to maintain it there's some cases of

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,970
where developers are working their spare

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,410
time but it's the minority but if we go

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,600
back to you know the river Primus

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:43,370
the reason the enterprise is using open

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,800
source software is not because it's free

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,930
they're using it to get more value we

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,660
move it to move faster and move it to

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,080
eat the world so for industry specific

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,880
problems for critical infrastructure in

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,790
order to achieve that sort of security

00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,700
and longevity it's rational to use a

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,490
commercial vendor and it's rational to

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,270
pay for that support and then for that

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:12,500
longevity and to bridge the gaps where

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,820
they're necessary so for our industry we

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,290
essentially are representing a family

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,570
within a larger group in the open-source

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,640
community we're developing deep

00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,620
knowledge about the open source software

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,630
we're talking their language we talk our

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:27,410
customers language we help translate

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,070
that we bring use cases in both

00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,110
directions

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,750
we help our customers understand the

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:35,480
pros and cons of what they're doing with

00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,860
the software with the trade-offs are and

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,700
we frankly just help them make good

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,310
decisions

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,050
of course we lobby for customers use

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,160
cases that's the most critical thing

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,130
that we're doing making sure that

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,440
they're supported and understood and

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,360
then finally we contribute we're

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,090
ensuring the continuity of the program

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,100
and we provide a bridge in case of

00:27:53,090 --> 00:28:01,520
eventual divergence so a little bit of

00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:03,860
that security in the ends you know open

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,310
source is all about community and I

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,340
think it this with fin off with the the

00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,970
increasing dependence on open source

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,370
there's also an increasing

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,740
interdependence between companies and

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,600
vendors it's becoming less and less

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,280
hierarchical we know that when we're

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,530
working with companies we're working

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,780
directly with the developers there we're

00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,220
creating relationships much like the

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,190
relationships that we're creating in the

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,800
open-source community and ultimately

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,260
it's it's it's good for everybody

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,480
that sense of community is raising

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,450
awareness about what code needs to be

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,470
built the value of the customers are

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,730
bringing in the value of the vendors are

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,280
bringing the value that the open source

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,770
projects are bringing and in the end

00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,140
we're building more software more

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:53,030
quickly and really making the lives of

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:56,240
our end-users much better so this is a

00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:59,290
company as of I think it was February or

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,380
March a little bit bigger than that but

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:07,840
this is what it's all about so I would

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,840
like to thank everyone for participating

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,489
[Applause]

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:24,079
