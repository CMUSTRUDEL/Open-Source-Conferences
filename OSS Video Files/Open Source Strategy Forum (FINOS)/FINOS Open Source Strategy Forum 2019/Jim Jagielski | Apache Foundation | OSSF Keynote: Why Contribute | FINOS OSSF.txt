[Music]

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,720
hopefully everyone has had a fantastic

00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:22,359
time today I this is what the the third

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,130
open source software forum and every

00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,769
year just gets bigger every year just

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,570
gets better personally I think it's one

00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,759
of the preeminent you know even though

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,489
it's focused on FinTech and stuff like

00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,320
that I think everybody who just was some

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,770
sort of inkling about what open source

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,940
is about this is it this is perfect so

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,760
for the next ten minutes I'll be talking

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,520
to you a little bit about why you should

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,160
contribute back to open source hopefully

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,559
you'll get some some rationale and some

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,500
reason and some energy to actually start

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,870
that contribution Kopp process one thing

00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't want to have people walk away

00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:03,100
from it's this idea that consumption and

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,770
contribution or somehow mortal enemies

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,540
that you have to have one including with

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,240
the other that's certainly not the case

00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,979
even though at least in my opinion if

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,920
something is important to you enough

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:21,729
that you want to consume the software

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:27,700
then you should also I got it okay okay

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:29,530
perfect yeah okay dizzy yes okay so I

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,040
don't want people to have that that that

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,939
necessarily feeling decay what is it

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,740
that really drives people to contribute

00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:42,430
well one thing you have to remember is

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,610
that depending on the license that of

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,310
the software that you're using sometimes

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,280
you may not have a choice for example if

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:56,020
you're using software which is under a

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,100
copyleft license okay GPL a GPL

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,700
something like that

00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,509
then quite frankly you have to give back

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,840
if you're doing anything that remotely

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:11,200
smells of distribution or software as a

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,060
service with a GPL then you are required

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,310
to give stuff back you

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,470
don't have a choice in the matter you

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,110
can't just say oh man this is really

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,030
really sensitive to us or this is our

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,510
intellectual property I don't want to do

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,030
it if it's under copyleft you have to

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,670
that's part of the license that is part

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,910
of the agreement that you made when you

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,280
use that but what now if you have a

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,790
permissive license what happens if the

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,260
software you're consuming is Apache v2

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:47,260
or MIT or BSD or something like that

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,510
well I'll give you a little hint it's

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,040
okay if you don't contribute back okay

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,780
we wrote those licenses specifically so

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,349
you don't have to give back if you don't

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,750
want to of course we would prefer you to

00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,780
give that back and I will give you the

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,120
reasons and the rationale and and the

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,230
the go to mission on why you shook and

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,610
should be back but it's ok it's ok yeah

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,890
that's one of the things that bothers me

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,480
so much about this whole hoo-ha that's

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,660
going on in the open source world

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,570
nowadays with people complaining that

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,320
there is a large company using

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,910
open-source and not contributing back

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,400
that's the license of the software

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,920
they're using ok it certainly isn't

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,260
enough to warrant the idea of scrapping

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,819
the open source definition and trying to

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:43,480
figure out something else so why why

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:46,510
should you give software back what is in

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,030
it for you to contribute back well first

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,079
of all kind of like the right thing to

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:56,500
do as I said before if you are consuming

00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,590
software and they're asking you to give

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,560
stuff back and maybe you should maybe it

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,680
is not that hard of a thing to give some

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,420
things back in Thanks in appreciation

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
for the other work that's going on out

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,940
there ok it's saving you time it's

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,880
saving you resources it's just the right

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,510
thing to do and in some companies that

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,120
is enough that moral drive is enough to

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,590
push you over the edge and to figure out

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,690
the reasons in the process to go ahead

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,750
and do what's ever required to

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,669
contribute back another good thing

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,680
another good reason to contribute back

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:39,060
is that it really awards the company

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,760
when they're contributing back to open

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,680
source processes in projects they're

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,889
getting street cred they're getting some

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,699
community goodwill and in a lot of ways

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,470
and a lot of times that goodwill is

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,990
incredibly important we'll talk about

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,210
some ways in which that touches

00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,770
real-world things but just having the

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,050
community that you are dependent upon

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,680
liking you and considering you a good

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,910
neighbor someone who is really really

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,160
interested in helping the project grow

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,229
and succeed that will carry you through

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,110
a lot of ways that will carry you

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,930
through a lot of possible missteps as

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,970
you make that open-source journey inside

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,360
if the community knows that you're not

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,639
just using them as like serfs you know

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,710
out in the fields doing the tilling for

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,450
you and they'll be willing to give you

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,030
the benefit of the doubt and that can go

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,130
a long way in improving the morale of

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,590
the company but also your reputation

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,570
your credibility not only in the

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,190
open-source community but among your

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,570
clients and with your competitors

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,760
another very important thing to know

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,000
another number of people have touched on

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,570
it is that it really allows you to

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,849
attain a retain really really good

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,950
talent I don't think anyone will deny

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,990
the fact that some of the best people

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,870
who are you know developers and coders

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,090
and contributors are doing so by open

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,930
source because it's it's tapping a drive

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,910
inside of them

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,160
a lot of their people love the reasons

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,620
why people contribute their volunteer

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,830
time it's because it scratches a niche

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,539
it fulfills a need to them in a lot of

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,970
ways people who are open-source

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,550
contributors or artists and what they

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,500
want to do is is is share their skills

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,860
share their craft with like-minded

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,630
people so these are the kind of people

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,250
that you want in your IT department

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,990
these are the kind of people that you

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,760
want in your marketing department in

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,710
your graphics department in your

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,660
long-term strategy department

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,260
these are the people that you want to

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,330
hire and maintain and by having a

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,250
successful open source contribution

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,750
policy and process inside of your

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:54,210
company you will have your pick of of

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,020
excellent open source developers and

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,810
contributors out there another reason

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,370
that we see an awful lot nowadays is

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:08,130
that obviously no matter what open

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,040
source project you use it's not going to

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,560
do everything for you there are gonna be

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,510
some things that don't quite fit in with

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,670
your environment some additions

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,830
modifications and things that need that

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:23,550
you need to make and that will be a

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,630
little side fork inside of yourself okay

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,540
those are expensive and dangerous

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:34,740
because as those Forks as those in-house

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,780
Forks start to diverge and migrate away

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,550
from the regular open source version

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,280
you're missing out when software

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,470
enhancements performance enhancements

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,750
things of that nature and after a period

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,970
of time it's no longer even open source

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,160
project that you're working on it's an

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,500
in-house project that happened to have

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,780
some heritage a long long time ago in

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,840
the DNA that's an open source project

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,640
that is a very very bad dangerous thing

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,980
to do and it really isn't long term

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,360
strategically viable for companies out

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,500
there if you were consuming software and

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,960
if and if part of your company is

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,300
dependent upon that you really owe it to

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,270
yourselves your employees your

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,670
stockholders to take control of that to

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,300
take control of your own destiny and

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,740
when something is being developed and

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,110
created in an external open source

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,570
community contributing back to that

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,020
being part and parcel of that community

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:37,950
allows you to manage your destiny allows

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,380
you to exert some influence maybe on the

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,390
processes or feature set that you may

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,180
want to see in the next release of open

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,330
source software packing some open source

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,770
processes and communities it's kind of

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,780
like a pay-to-play kind of environment

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,390
so you don't get any

00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,090
at all unless you were part of the

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,760
community so again being able to have

00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,010
this opportunity to drive things in a

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,560
way that you weren't able to before you

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,640
have to make the commitment to do that

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,820
internet standards I mean there's gonna

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,190
talk about about standards lately today

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,200
and and elsewhere but this is the way

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,050
that we're seeing a lot of internal

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,300
collaboration going on as well and open

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,490
source processes by contributing to open

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,770
source standards you have to also

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,500
contribute to the open source projects

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,900
as well the two are so tightly aligned

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,420
that there's really no way of doing one

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,360
without the other and finally at the end

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,410
of the day it is a strategic investment

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,560
in the long-term viability not only of

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:46,070
the company but also in the open source

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,490
project that you are dependent upon okay

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,350
if you're not contributing back then

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,480
chances are good that your competitor is

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,850
maybe not aren't contributing back and

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,740
if nobody contributes back then you have

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,170
this open source project that so many

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,839
people are dependent upon but without

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,480
the support without the contribution

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,330
based without the healthy viable diverse

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,820
community that real successful open

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,060
source projects demand and so by

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:17,450
contributing back you're enabling that

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,750
strategic investment long term for the

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,589
project that company and also

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,170
incorporated in that strategic

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,300
investment is that your employees who

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,670
are contributing to the open source

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,820
project instead of just using it instead

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,580
of just you consuming it they become

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,400
more expert in that open source project

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,260
they understand it a lot more they

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,089
understand the conditions the

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,990
requirements the limitations of that

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:47,900
software and that's a incredible asset

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,270
that you can have inside of the company

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,250
that your competitors did not have at

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,330
the end of the day it's all about

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:58,400
reducing risk and especially in the

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,820
technology area such as financial

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,550
services in FinTech it's all about

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,649
reducing risk it's all about remove

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:10,130
moving those possibilities that will

00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:13,490
either damage you your clients or your

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,220
employees one thing I would want to

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,490
stress if you're just dipping your toe

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,399
into the idea of contributing to open

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,010
source projects try to focus at least

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,940
your first initial efforts on those open

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:31,459
source projects which are housed under

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:35,450
an open source foundation such as finest

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:37,430
Pinos or Apache or Oasis the reason why

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,130
is because they usually have their IP

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,570
provenance rules down pretty hard okay

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,089
you're getting open source software

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,459
under a foundation you can pretty much

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:49,430
guarantee that that has gone through the

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:52,279
kind of IP Providence that you want to

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,890
be part of ok just contributing to

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,810
something on github not saying that it's

00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,060
not a good idea or a bad idea

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,459
but you may not be sure what the IP

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,600
provenance of that project could be are

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,250
you sure that's something you want to

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,860
bring in a house I've even seen people

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,200
just say oh it's on github or wherever

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,570
for example therefore it must be open

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,570
source without even realizing there

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,209
isn't even an explicit license in that

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,089
repo and if there's no license in that

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:22,220
repo I'm sorry it's under copyleft it's

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,980
under copyright and you really have no

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,589
rights to it at all so going under a

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,329
foundation and using and contributing

00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:33,800
and being a member of the foundation

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:36,640
will really help out so really at the

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,890
end of the day why aren't you

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,920
contributing yeah I know I've heard all

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,800
the stories before it's hard we have a

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,449
really really impressive patent

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,329
portfolio and we don't want to risk that

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:52,850
or you know it's really really difficult

00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,709
for you know managing our employees I

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,600
mean how do I manage an employee who's

00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:59,990
doing some stuff on an open source and

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,570
stuff is stuff inside but I promise you

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,760
I guarantee you that why you were

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,130
struggling with these answers with these

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,600
questions and these answers answers that

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:14,720
have been created in in sessions and in

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,510
seminars and conferences like this your

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,839
competition already is

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,750
so really if that's the only thing that

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,910
drives you is that hey everybody else is

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,980
on that bus we better jump on to that's

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:31,540
not a bad reason that's not a bad reason

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:35,380
at all but definitely leverage the help

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,779
of experts people that you talk to

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,399
network with today I mean I know we're

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,199
at the end of the day people have

00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,360
families and homes and other things that

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,250
go to there's gonna be time for you to

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,260
network with people outside okay

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,269
definitely do that there's a lot of

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:55,180
expertise and knowledge available for

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:57,959
you so go out contribute have fun and be

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:01,800
part of the open-source community

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:04,920
because it wants you to be part of it

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,920
