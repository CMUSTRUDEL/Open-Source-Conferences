Pierre De Belen is a Managing Director for Goldman Sachs, and Ashish Kuthiala is Senior Director of Strategic Marketing at GitLab. At OSSF in New York, they both presented and demoed FINOS Platinum member Goldman Sachs open sourcing of two products - a modeling language internally named "PURE", and a visual modeling platform that generates PURE models known in Goldman Sachs as "Alloy" - into FINOS. 

WHAT IS PURE?

PURE is a modeling language inspired in part by languages such as the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and UML. PURE also has many elements of a functional programming language. Goldman Sachs uses PURE to create and construct internal models for functions such as reporting and clearing. 

WHAT IS ALLOY?

Alloy is a visual modeling environment and system that creates, maintains, and helps distribute models built in PURE. Behind the scenes, Alloy uses git, (fellow FINOS member) Gitlab for its SDLC (software development lifecycle), and standard source control concepts to manage changes to, and reviews of, models. Alloy can also generate code in languages and formats such as SQL, JSON, JSON Schema (and, internally to Goldman Sachs, SLANG) in order to import and update target systems & infrastructure w/ revised model definitions/extensions.
