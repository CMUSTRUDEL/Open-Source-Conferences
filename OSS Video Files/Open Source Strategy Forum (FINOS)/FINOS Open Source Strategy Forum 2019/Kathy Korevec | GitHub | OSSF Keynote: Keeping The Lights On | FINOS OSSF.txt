00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:19,289
hello everybody I love coming out to New

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,359
York my family is out here and I love

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,460
coming out to meet all of our customers

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,580
and talk with developers in the industry

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,199
so I'm pretty excited to be here and I

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:34,559
also want to talk a little bit about

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:36,540
whoops about why so this is me sorry I

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,059
have curly hair if you didn't recognize

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,770
me a little bit this is me about 15

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,320
years ago and this is the reason why I'm

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,000
so excited to be working at github I

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,149
work on the product management team

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,550
where I run all of our community tools

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,379
and so I work on our dashboard and I

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,850
work on community forum I work on a lot

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,899
of things that are maintained errs and

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,510
our open source contributors really love

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:02,879
except 15 years ago hi this is me I'm a

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,070
I'm a trained engineer and then I

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,320
eventually through my career found

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,619
myself in product management and this is

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,260
me at working for a design agency and I

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:18,990
look like you can say I look really sad

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,610
in this photo and I once I was staring

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,159
at my computer or staring at a green

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,600
black screen and I was also looking out

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,390
at I was the only engineer at this

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,430
company and working with probably about

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,460
20 different visual visual design and

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,380
user experience design of designers in

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,150
my there were my colleagues and I was

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,729
looking out at all of them and they were

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,560
having a blast they were like we're with

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,360
were with our people we totally

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,000
understand this like we're having such a

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,740
good time and I was like oh I am just

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
back here like coding away on these

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,970
beautiful designs I was having a really

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,219
good time but I was by myself so what I

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,719
didn't have was my community I didn't

00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,700
have people to talk to you people to

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,710
learn from people that could mentor me

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,680
and I was seeing this happening all

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,479
around me so I was I was pretty

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,119
disappointed in that and I think it

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,580
probably ultimately did end up resulting

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,040
in me not advancing or learning as much

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,000
as I could have at that

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,909
when I was working as an engineer in

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,549
2006 in San Francisco

00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:25,340
luckily times have changed

00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:27,739
so on the github platform right now we

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,500
have 40 million developers and those are

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,659
developers who are connected all around

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,700
the globe forty million is a lot like we

00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,230
went from like working as a solitary

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,269
engineer in the basement on a green and

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,840
black screen to 40 million of our best

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:43,879
friends working with us and and what is

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,790
happening is that this is actually

00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,500
changing we've noticed that there are

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,780
we've seen that there are ten million

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,060
developers who joined github just last

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,620
year so this is rapidly advancing there

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,349
are a lot of new people who are coming

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,450
to the platform and this isn't just

00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,370
developers and open-source it's not just

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,690
maintainer these are people who are in

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,139
organizations as well

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,940
we have over 300 or over 3 million

00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:11,299
organizations that are using github and

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,690
this is from some of the fortune 500

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:17,199
and according to the Blackduck survey

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,940
was the future of open source from 2006

00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,579
they said that 39% of companies said

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,209
that they were using open source so and

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:30,440
then a - and that was in 2010 in 2015

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,000
that number doubled 78% of companies

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,430
said that they were using open source

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,340
and so companies are tapping into the

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,819
power of open source and what they're

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,930
doing is they're putting their operating

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,699
systems these aren't just their pet

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,799
projects they're putting their operating

00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:48,139
systems their databases their critical

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,379
developer work clothes all are using

00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,120
open source so why are they doing this

00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,579
they're doing this for a couple of

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,989
different reasons the communities that

00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,239
are using open source and using github

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,919
they're looking for freedom of vendor

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,599
lock-in so they want to be able to make

00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,790
their own decisions about the software

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,650
that they're using they're looking for

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,540
the quality of the solutions that

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,239
they're investing in so they're looking

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,340
for who is maintaining these projects

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,870
what does the history look like they

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,060
want all of that information out in the

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,549
open so that you can make smarter

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,859
security decisions smarter investments

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,960
in the future of your software and then

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,790
ultimately they're looking for the

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,310
ability to customize and

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,370
and I think that's so important because

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,350
that means that companies are pushing

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,330
their engineering teams to then

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,820
contribute back to open-source because

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,640
of the amount that they're using so when

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:44,150
you really think about that they want to

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,280
be able to customize and fix 65% of

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,750
companies are contributing back to open

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,610
source the open source that they're

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,870
using they're consuming it they're also

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,120
contributing back to it

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,300
67% of the companies that Black Duck

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,070
talked to are actually actively

00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,900
encouraging their developers to

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,230
contribute back to open source which

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,110
means they get to take more advantage of

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,830
powering that community of tait of

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,340
participating in these kinds of

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,590
conversations and that is paying off so

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:16,040
Black Duck as part of that research

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,470
paper they surveyed over 1,100 different

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,350
different code bases and they found that

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,990
there was an open source component in in

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,510
nearly all of them and actually on

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,760
average there were 257 open source

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,270
components present in all of those code

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,660
bases and again hope we found this to

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,710
you we've actually found that that

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,790
software projects that are using open

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,860
source are we found that there are 99%

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,640
of software projects that have open

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,990
source dependencies and so you can think

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,440
about it this way you think about that

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,850
40 million developers and then 99% of

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,230
software projects have open source

00:05:52,850 --> 00:06:00,470
dependencies so when you import an open

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,380
source project into your project

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,700
you're not just typing in import and

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,480
getting access to a different kind of

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:13,670
code base what you're doing yes what

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,680
you're doing is what you're doing is

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,660
actually extending your team you're

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,420
extending your team to the people who

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:25,940
are contributing to the code that is

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:29,810
powering those dependencies but when we

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,060
think about this what you think about me

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,910
sitting in the back of that design

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,650
studio overlooking my computer and all

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,460
of my friends having a good

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,990
I was a solitary developer but those

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,820
days don't exist we don't have

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,330
developers who are filling that

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,730
stereotype the solitary developer with a

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,680
lot of pizza and redbull working on a

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:55,060
green and black screen by themselves

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,400
this truly is a very connected community

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,100
and this means that we're extending our

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,190
teams and that is a powerful and very

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,080
good thing for your company because you

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,750
are extending your your team your you're

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,910
tapping into millions of different

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,730
people have different ideas and can

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,200
contribute back to how you're thinking

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,060
about software how you're talking about

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,230
software where it's going the future of

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,570
it etc so speaking of the future of all

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,520
of this I want to talk a little bit

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,410
about I think something that I struggle

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,600
with and I think about a lot at github I

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,990
know you all do too and that is how do

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,210
we hire and retain people to work on our

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,920
projects in our companies so we're

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,750
becoming more and more dependent on

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,160
open-source itself but at the same time

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,580
traditionally we when we recruit

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,730
engineers we require them to have a CS

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,800
degree and often we want them to have 5

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,390
or more years of experience when you

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,120
think about open source growing so fast

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,650
a lot of people are coming to open

00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,900
source they're brand-new they're out of

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,000
college they don't have a CS degree they

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,470
don't have 5 years of experience they're

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,880
learning from their peers they're

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,370
contributing to some of the most

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,370
impactful open-source projects in the

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:13,540
world and they are brilliant wouldn't

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,030
you like to have them at your company in

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,550
2016 only 60 thousand just over 60

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,410
thousand CS degrees were awarded there

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,420
are five hundred thousand according to

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,190
the department Department of Labor 500

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,670
thousand computer related jobs open

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,560
today so at this rate only 19 percent of

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,690
those jobs can be filled with people by

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,669
people with CS degrees and then when you

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,190
think about that requirement five years

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,310
experience in 2019 according to Stack

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,870
Overflow less than 50% of the people who

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,970
answered that survey said they had five

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,830
years experience even though they had

00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,630
experience with open-source they're

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,250
contributing they definitely have the

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,220
skills to be able to do this

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,360
and this gets even worse by 2016 there

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,400
will be 3.5 million

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,440
tech jobs available so if we continue

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,450
down this rate of thinking about these

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,790
traditional requirements for open source

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,060
we're continuing to lock people out of

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,320
the story so what I want to do is kind

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,260
of propose this new way of thinking

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,450
about about contributions and when we

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,800
think about who we want to hire so a lot

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,260
of people a lot of recruiters will come

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,000
to get hub and they'll say I want to

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,170
hire some ore though they'll look at

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,580
somebody's get hub profile and I say I

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,430
want to hire somebody who has a lot of

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,510
green squares I purposefully didn't put

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,770
green squares up here because I want to

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,470
talk about this a little more abstractly

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,800
but this is my contribution graph I took

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,410
this photo last night and luckily I

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,600
didn't get discouraged 15 years ago when

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,450
I continued on my journey with writing

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,130
software but this these are all of the

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,650
all of the contributions that I've made

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:50,190
to various different projects over the

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,950
past year in reality especially because

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,140
I'm a product manager I have a lot of

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,090
conversations at conversations with my

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,830
customers with maintainer x' developers

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,770
with my teammates etc and we're talking

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,080
about plans we're talking about bugs

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,940
we're we're talking about all of the

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,750
things that happen in and around the

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,570
code so really my contribution graph

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,670
should look more like this every single

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,530
one of those black squares those places

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,800
where it looks like I'm not doing that

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,910
much work I am doing so much work with

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,640
my team to talk about the entire project

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:30,570
so what we're talking about here really

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,580
is somebody's reputation because what it

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,560
takes to contribute to open source is

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,060
not just the commits it's everything

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,750
that happens around its understanding

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,700
the the contribution guidelines the

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,200
kubernetes team has a lot of

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,880
conversations out in the open that they

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,130
actually just have to record by a video

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,770
and make public all of that stuff is not

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,770
necessarily code that they're committing

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,180
but it is extremely valuable to them to

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,910
be able to advance the kubernetes

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,010
project this is happening all over the

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,210
place so if you if you look into open

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,850
source and you look into where people

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,900
are having these kinds of conversations

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,590
they do have these conversations

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,350
in the code in issues in pull requests

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,250
write-ups and commit messages etc but

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,160
you also haven't seen these

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,260
conversations all over the place so you

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
see these conversations from experts as

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,140
well

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,430
Yehuda Katz who who worked on ember he's

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,920
talking about he knows a ton about

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,570
JavaScript frameworks he is here talking

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,210
about what he loves about typescript

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,580
wouldn't you as a new developer like to

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,500
tap into that information from yahudah

00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,830
he's putting it all up on Twitter for

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,710
you publicly there our developer dev dev

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,840
2 developer communities who are making

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,720
it possible more possible for developers

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,390
to talk about what they're interested in

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,610
their projects etc beyond the code and

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,620
you also see open source communities

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,960
like the open J's Foundation talking

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,520
about their releases on medium and where

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,590
to go and get the release what's in it

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,530
is etc so there's so much more

00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,700
information about this then then we

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,100
really think about when we're just

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,140
looking at that one contribution graph

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,060
and one of the things I love about

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,550
thinking about open source in this new

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,710
way or in a kind of a different way is

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,420
it means that we're lowering the barrier

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,640
to entry for the people who are new to

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,470
the platform or people who are new to

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,660
coding in general and those are the

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,820
people who are the most vulnerable and

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,220
the most valuable as we think about

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,620
advancing software in general we want

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,110
those people to stick around and so we

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,550
want to empower developers to mentor

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,820
them to invite them into that

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,710
conversation and that's why those those

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,770
negative moments in my contribution

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,990
graph are so important and I want to

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,200
talk you talk a little bit about where

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,780
this happened recently I think probably

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,410
you've all seen this picture this is the

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,380
photo of the black hole and hopefully

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,450
you've seen it by now if not this this

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,100
photo is yeah one of my favorites

00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:02,040
I am a huge also a huge space geek so I

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,260
love telling this story but basically

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,910
scientists have theorized that black

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,650
holes exist for a really long time but

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,020
we have never gotten a photo of one and

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,840
so this team found one in the galaxy

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,660
like 55 million light years away

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,390
and they just they found one that would

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,990
be a very good

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,340
candidate to be able to take a photo of

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:27,220
but the problem was they had to build no

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,560
one telescope could could go take a

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,020
photo of something 55 million light

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,550
years away so they had to build a

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,010
planet-sized telescope

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,930
what they did was they connected all of

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,910
the different they connected like I

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,310
think 12 different telescopes all around

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,740
the world triangulated a whole bunch of

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:49,480
stuff took photos of of the black hole

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,730
when they had to navigate weather

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,200
systems and all kinds of stuff they took

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,690
photos of the black hole from all of

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,000
these different all of these different

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,640
telescopes all around the world and they

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,800
collected all of that data and all of

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,200
that data needed to be processed somehow

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,420
and the team I love this photo this is

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,640
dr. Katie Baumann who was one of the

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,830
lead engineers lead scientist on this

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,910
project and what I love about this photo

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:18,040
is it shows that that that moment where

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,420
she's looking at this at her screen for

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,520
the first time she's seeing this photo

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,390
rendered for the first time and it's

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,260
just pure joy she's it's all of the hard

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,180
work that went into years of her

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,010
basically crunching numbers and working

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,870
with this data to be able to bring the

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,510
scientific discovery to the world and

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,090
this photo captures that moment so when

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,430
I look at it I'm thinking why what

00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,020
happened over those over over those

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,560
years while she's crunching these

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,370
numbers and it's really we actually at

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,440
github we were like okay well data code

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,750
processing image they used open source

00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,060
and so we asked ourselves this question

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,060
and the answer was actually really cool

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,930
there we looked at something called

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,080
community contributions which I'll

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,640
explain in a second but but the amount

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,200
basically the amount of they had

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,630
hundreds of core contributors to the

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,930
actual project but the amount of

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,110
contributors that built that image was

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,700
just over twenty one thousand so it's

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,550
pretty incredible that's the power of

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,140
the open source network so you think

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,970
about those core contributors those are

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,410
the direct contributors and really

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,870
that's just the tip of the iceberg

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,250
right those are people who you know by

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,930
name you're probably working with a lot

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,220
those are your teammates your colleagues

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,480
etc and theirs

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,959
they're the ones that you're reviewing

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,620
their code pair programming with them

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,360
when you think about it every time

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,089
you're importing new projects and you're

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,709
adding dependencies etc you're adding a

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:50,019
whole bunch of stuff you're basically

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:53,519
extending your team to the open source

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:56,199
community and so we found that 21,000

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,060
community contributors were contributing

00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,379
to the black hole project and we were

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,939
like oh there might be a fluke but then

00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:04,629
we went and we did that same calculation

00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:06,730
on a thousand of the most popular open

00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:09,399
source repositories on github we found

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,490
that on average it's just about 75,000

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,129
core community contributors per project

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,649
this massive this bigger than Google's

00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:19,209
engineering team Microsoft's apples

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,769
that's huge so basically what you're

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,819
doing is you're saying okay I have a

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:26,319
project and I want to enlist 75,000

00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:28,509
teammates to help me build this thing

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,610
the power of open source the power of

00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:33,639
having all of those people contribute to

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,910
this is super important and what this

00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:40,899
means to us a github is that open source

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:43,870
is one open source is actually what is

00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:46,329
powering us to create and write the

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,220
future of software and what's cool about

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,050
this is that we actually predict we have

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,529
40 million developers on the on the

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,420
platform today we actually predicted

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,300
that by 2025 there'll be a hundred

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,310
million so when you think about that

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,779
50,000 jobs available are posted today

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,909
or five hundred thousand jobs posted

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:08,439
today for computer related roles a

00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:10,299
hundred million open source developers

00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,329
and what we want to do our

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:15,730
responsibility is to foster those people

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,280
who are coming to open source to develop

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,010
them grow them and retain them in open

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,049
source and so it's even more important

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,669
for us to think about sure we need to

00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:27,669
think about good developer we're close

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:29,110
we need to think about secure code we

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,730
need to think about everything that it

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,520
takes to be able to contribute to open

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,530
source and to run a project but we also

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,520
need to think about the newcomers and

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,200
mentorships

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,299
and those conversations that are

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,000
happening to make to to make sure every

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:45,490
everybody stays welcome

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,289
because ultimately the future of

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,860
open-source if we're gonna get to a

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:52,390
hundred million developers that level of

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,370
a man advancement is gonna take

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,559
everybody so the future of open source

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,720
is everyone it's me it's my colleagues

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,360
back in San Francisco it's all of you

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,059
it's it's everyone and I know this

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,400
because we just released the state of

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:08,140
the Octobers and one of the coolest

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,780
things I found on that on the state of

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,850
the October's is how actually global

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,860
open source is some of the biggest

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,630
countries that are growing an open

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,450
source are actually India and China and

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,950
I encourage you all of this data is

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,860
available in the state of the Octobers

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,049
online these are just a few clips of it

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,470
I encourage you definitely go check that

00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:31,360
out there's a whole bunch more about

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,549
open source that is pretty cool that we

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,480
have discovered from from looking at our

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,240
on all of the open source data so when

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,980
you think about open source and you

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,919
think about the projects you're using

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,419
and the code you're using I really want

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,970
you to think about where that is coming

00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:52,570
from because this is truly a globally

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,130
connected team this is a still I took

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,230
from a visualization that github did a

00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,590
little while ago where we actually

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,880
plotted over a 30 day cycle where all

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,039
the commits are happening across the

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,600
globe and so these aren't just lights

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,789
these are actually commits that you see

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,450
on this on this globe on the on this

00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:13,720
planet and that's pretty powerful it's

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,929
happening everywhere 100 million across

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,600
the entire globe and ultimately what we

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:24,810
want to do at github is just keep the

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:28,470
lights on so thank you

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,470
[Applause]

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:39,989
