Have you been challenged to establish an Open Source program in a traditional IT organization in a large enterprise? What if the industry is traditionally risk averse? Are you a technology evangelist that tries to make things happen but feel your hands tied? Does open source adoption turn your technology standards into the wild west? Do your engineers feel empowered or confused? Damian Ng, who lead Open Source for Express Scripts, will walk through his journey to build a community driven open source program from ground up.

[Music]

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,800
my name is Damon and I'm going to talk

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,000
about building a community driven

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,970
open-source program in a healthcare

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,250
company by the way in case you wonder

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,130
why I put the word ingestion at the end

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,800
is because when I submit at the top I

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,960
think a lot I have a lot more time so I

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,200
realize I only have like 25 minutes so

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,219
I'll just focus on one part of our open

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:46,829
source program all right so a little bit

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,629
about me and who the heck is talking so

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,590
I'm the head of architecture for Express

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,379
Scripts I'm going to talk about a

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,980
company in the next slide my primary job

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,989
is that I run a platform strategy

00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,649
Pittacus architecture and also lead a

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,140
lot of the technical innovation I built

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,049
and let the open source program in our

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,060
company for last three and a half years

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:15,150
I live in San Luis and my moonlighting

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,790
job is that I organize pickup soccer for

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,960
my company as well in st. Louis so

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:28,650
anyone like soccer here away watch

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:32,549
anyone recognize the team Jesse its

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,520
England and for any who follow British

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,150
football soccer they score like 11 goes

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,740
into games so proud at least I put the

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,939
jersey here so Express Scripts we are a

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,159
fortune 22 organization until beginning

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,610
until the end of last year when we

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,869
become part of the signal family so what

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,090
do we do we are primarily the one of the

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,060
country's largest PBM the pharmacy

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,079
benefit management company so imagine if

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,810
you go to any of your pharmacy with the

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,690
script by your doctor you want to get

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,910
your medication then the pharmacist will

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,180
probably do this

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,980
I get your prescription card and start

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,230
typing a bunch of stuff at that time

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,930
they're actually talking to our systems

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,810
so in a certain way we are located as a

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,720
medical transaction systems we are also

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,340
one of the country's largest home

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,280
delivery pharmacies and we serve more

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,720
than million people 100 million people

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,480
so so much about the company so let's go

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,480
talk about the background so how many of

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:50,990
you are in fortune 200 company fortune

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,880
500 company all right so let me try it

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,110
how many of you actually are so

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,180
significant amount of your ID to who

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,170
have a favorite company out there very

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,130
cool

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,860
not many of them so out then that may be

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,450
an interesting perspective so our legacy

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,960
is they're similar to any fortune 100

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,570
company we are so significant amount of

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,530
our development effort to the favorite

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:22,280
vendors what it means is that a lot of

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,100
post exploration and adoption of any

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,080
open source technology actually being

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,910
outsourced as well so our vendor are

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,860
responsible for doing a lot of them and

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,120
most of the time we don't necessarily

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,670
need to be too concerned about any legal

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,590
rights or rights of use of open source

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,840
technology because our contractual

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,989
agreement with a vendor you should cover

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,360
that now if our some other engineers

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,270
actually want to use and just open

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,190
source technology we have the ivory

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,489
tower organization that's responsible

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:58,340
for approval so you can imagine that

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,440
it's not very efficient but it's also

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,480
because we don't have the need to do

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,480
that because if you outsource majority

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,730
of your IP then you you won't have many

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,739
use cases to do open source technology

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:16,640
so we don't need to build an open source

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:18,650
program up until 2016 is that same for a

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,900
lot of large organization my company

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,630
went to a technology transformation

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,600
program so we want to refocus ourselves

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,770
on innovation we believe that technology

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,460
is

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,949
and edge in our business in some IP

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,930
being supporting the business we believe

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:39,139
that technology is an edge for our

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,810
business so we almost like we jumpstart

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:45,379
our technology innovation initiative and

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,590
we begin to hire a lot more engineers

00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:51,409
and focus on innovation guess what right

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:55,400
we begin to look at leveraging open

00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:59,960
source technology as a key indication a

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,909
key Avenue to do so but of course and

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,250
then we realize that geez we don't

00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:06,110
actually have an open source program to

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,419
streamline that we can always do a proof

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,229
over everything but everything will be

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,919
painfully slow

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,949
so we begin the journey to build a

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,720
program so if you look at a priority

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,190
every company's open source program

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,199
usually have these three things so this

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,020
is nothing like new to all of you right

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,449
you need to figure out how to use

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,000
efficiency in just new technology in the

00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:31,430
organization you need to figure out how

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,229
do you handle a lot of the rights of use

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,229
and copyrights things too in order to

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,659
contribute to open source trust me in a

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,750
healthcare organization contributing

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:45,620
your IP or your code to github is

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,190
actually a lot more complicated than you

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,599
imagine

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,150
but I'm not going to talk about today

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:52,729
obviously we will talk about in the

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,880
sourcing as well so today we focus

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,529
mainly on the ingestion next time if we

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,669
got opportunity talking I would talk

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:05,180
about other stuff so any open source

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:08,270
ingestion program always is a balance

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,759
between conflicting needs right we want

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,400
to minimize our legal risk being if we

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,039
adopt a specific technology using the

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,250
wrong license it may actually expose our

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,810
IP we want to also measure technology

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,979
footprint I'm going to focus on that a

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,569
little bit being if you say hey we adopt

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,090
and embrace open source does it mean

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,099
that every tech lead can use their

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,380
favorite technologies of the same

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:36,409
problem probably not we want to

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,169
obviously encourage innovation security

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:40,550
and compliance are also important but we

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,630
also need to make sure that it is

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,350
scalable

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,970
for a phone charger organization because

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,130
we have thousands and thousands of

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,100
technology employees so we cannot have

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:55,070
let's say a single team to approve

00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,590
everything it just won't scale and it

00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:02,810
will be very disruptive for our

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:05,240
engineers so what do we want to focus on

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,520
so initially if you hear a lot of

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,440
keynotes this morning there like a lot

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,470
of open source at the option is really

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,170
really about bottom-up so what we try to

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,280
do is we try to remove as many hurdles

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,090
to make a decentralized scalable program

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,640
as possible

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,290
so instead focusing on a technical

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,720
aspect of it the first thing we do is

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,550
that we focus on the legal policy if you

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,250
have a legal policy that is commonly

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,260
understood and be able to get executed

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:38,980
in a federated manner of things you get

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:42,650
a lot easier so guiding principle for

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,620
building a legal policy we want to

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,650
encourage our exploring technology as

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,230
much as possible we want to care and be

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,610
the only high risk area and I'm going to

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,230
talk about what are the high risk area

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,100
later

00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:00,740
one thing that is take time to convince

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,990
our legal and compliance that you don't

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,080
necessarily need to be a hundred percent

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,480
compliance because from 90 to 100 is the

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,790
most effort right so a lot of times you

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,680
want to be compliant but if you need to

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,860
get into a hundred person appliance that

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,660
become a diminishing return of effort

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,030
the most important thing is that we want

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:23,810
to be in a self-governance mode as much

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,700
as possible being the intense between

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,370
technology and legal at the time is that

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,660
we don't want to suddenly expand to a

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,610
team of a hundred legal a legal team or

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,039
a hundred people architecture team just

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,500
to do like open source governor's they

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,500
want to focus as much as clear

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,980
documentation and peer guys so that we

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,420
can do is have governor's by I'm trying

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,270
to like balance between here and there

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,500
so that's cough on so immediate

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,340
challenge there are way too many

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,410
licenses out there

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,920
two of them will have that different

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,310
definition what we also find out soon is

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,910
that legal knowledge of open source

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,540
technology is actually not a lot in the

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,020
market

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,000
so in fact we actually which legal

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,120
counsel multiple times during this

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,030
journey and by way there's a difference

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,590
between us understanding open source but

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,320
there's also a difference between doing

00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:30,680
that versus building an open source

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,870
program for a large organization what

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,350
get into some funky situation is that

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,210
you think that I can get coverage for a

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,910
license most of the time what we

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,450
actually find out is that the use case

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,850
and the license combination is what get

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,650
tricky because same license different

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,850
use cases that we sell could be

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,340
different and I'll talk about in the

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,190
next life so and I already talked about

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,740
we want to avoid building a huge team to

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,620
support the process so we can always go

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,390
through individual approval but we also

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,820
want to balance the need to do we need

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,800
be a huge team or do you want a lengthy

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,830
process or do you want something to

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,690
scale as much as possible all right so

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,630
what do we do so first thing we do is

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,670
that we work up with both our internal

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,010
counsel and outside County so we build

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,100
in ingestion matrix so what does it mean

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,920
here is that we focus on most of the key

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,830
consumption scenario so our principal

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,470
engineer organization basically

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,890
summarized those eight key consumption

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,110
scenario and we also look at top 11

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:40,550
licenses which give us maybe three years

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:44,360
ago about 88% of like all open source

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,850
usage so we build a matrix on what are

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,330
the things that we care so if you look

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,820
at that is that we only care about the

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,340
things in red and in yellow everything

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,210
in green we do not need an explicit

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,880
written approval

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,800
we still need individual who adopt the

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,930
technology to record that for tracking

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,030
purposes and obviously we need to

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,010
understand about things dye versioning

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,290
and stuff like that because different

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,540
versions of the same open-source

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,540
software may have different Isis's okay

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,240
so we handle menu approval for

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,310
everything else so if you just look at

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,480
the coloring or a diagram without

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:26,509
reading the text what do you see you see

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,880
a lot of greens so surprisingly most of

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,310
our ingesting arrows are green it means

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,019
that we want our engineers our

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,019
development community architecture

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:38,029
community not to go through a explicit

00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:42,709
approval process so we make it easy for

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:45,019
them to ingest software so one thing

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:47,149
that we find out is that a lot of the

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:50,089
native mobile application create a lot

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,220
more rare scenario because the moment

00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,740
you become a native app you are in

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,410
distributing software mode so license

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,050
takes a lot less forgiving when you're

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,579
distributing software again instead of

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,920
let's say hosting something in your

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:06,230
server so that's something if you look

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,329
at the previous slide a lot of that is

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:13,069
because of native mobile scenario ok

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,360
dependency management is fun right the

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:16,190
moment going to last your jobs

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,829
gratification and you're NPM have like

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,470
300 dependencies so the moment you just

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:26,870
keep tracking dependency you get into a

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:29,300
lot of trouble so our complexity what we

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,800
also find out is that your program need

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,170
to handle a lot more than just

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,060
downloading downloading software from

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,870
github of on the Internet is only one

00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,579
way to ingest open source software so we

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,790
end up building different process flow

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:46,190
for or the exceptions for example if I

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,690
need to purchase an office of the shelf

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,230
software most the time you have some

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,630
open source aspect to that or if one of

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,000
our vendors do a custom application for

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,589
us and use open source software we need

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,810
them to disclose that and make it part

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,370
of our process so that we can record

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,980
that because we are purchasing their

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,540
software so we have different scenario

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,240
we end up building a bunch of process

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,579
flow to handle all these exceptions what

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,279
is interesting for us as a learning

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:16,100
experience is that we switch our legal

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,410
perspectives from used are basically

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,750
asking our vendors to take on all the

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,520
risk of open source into a mode where we

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:30,440
want to share the risk with

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:31,790
vendors so we have a legal posse are we

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,810
happy at a time

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,030
not really and you're like why you have

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,870
the policy right so if the lawyers say

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,370
yes everything should be good but it

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,190
leads to the next problem which is if

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,780
everything is easier proof we need to

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,670
start measuring technology footprint

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,680
right so we're all mostly the balance

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,870
between the ivory tower of approving

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,000
nothing into a you're automatically

00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,650
approving everything and that no

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,540
technology flippin become a mess so what

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,600
we do is that we build something called

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,760
the technology foundry a formula is very

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,160
very much a pharmacy term by the way but

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,860
what we do is that we build a technology

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,410
standard agreed and maintained by the

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,650
people doing the work so that is the

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,560
important thing we do not explicitly say

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,480
enterprise architecture create a lot a

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,550
bunch of standard and the development

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,960
team did a 4d standard even though most

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,700
of it handy I could haven't touched the

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,370
software a lot right they read the

00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:34,550
favorite report or they talk to their

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,370
favorite consulting vendors we want any

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,210
technology standard to be agreed and

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:43,100
maintained by the engineering community

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,870
is various context use case some

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,060
versions driven very so what we don't

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,910
want to get into is that if this

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,830
software is approved then our developer

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,930
will find the worst way to use the

00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,780
software so lesson learned so we're like

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,970
okay no instead we say under these type

00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,660
of you see a piece of scenario use this

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,030
software

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,310
the version become important for a few

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,260
reasons one there are situation that

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,290
like different version of the same

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,120
software potentially is we've got is a

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,860
rewrite right so anyone have built

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
angular app I have went to the same

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,370
thing right

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,740
and we focus a lot of what we can hence

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,260
our opinion we don't put things into the

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,090
formula until some of our engineers have

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,130
actually touched the software they may

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,710
not need to read the code they should by

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,290
the way but we don't want anything into

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,210
a formula until somebody have said yes I

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,490
have built a POC it works it works like

00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,529
that and the important thing finally is

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,109
that architecture

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,659
lead the process but there's federated

00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:46,849
decisions the decisions are made by the

00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:48,169
folks doing the work so this is how I

00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:51,379
describe committee whether it's a

00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:53,959
federated management right so this

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:55,819
lifestyle should be fairly standard for

00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,849
most of you right so you're brand new

00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,889
technology you get into a cup of POC do

00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,839
some experiment then you get into a

00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,519
restricted mode where you know what you

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,499
can do it for like this and this but not

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,119
everything they're going to something

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,849
like you know what this is a common

00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:13,959
standard FM please do it and then at the

00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:17,359
end the software may go into containment

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,759
we built a community driven life cycle

00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:21,529
to handle that so to move them new tech

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,619
to experimental you need at least one

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,239
piece of engineer sponsored if you want

00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:28,489
to move in a restrictor you need more

00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:30,919
and then if you want it to become a

00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:33,229
company recommended software for this

00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,649
particular use case and scenario you

00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:39,889
need a community to agree to that right

00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:41,929
what is also important for us is that if

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:45,409
you want to put something in a

00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:47,720
recommender mode then it either be a new

00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:50,779
capability that is not being handled

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,509
before or you are required as a

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,639
community to put certain things in a

00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,649
legacy in the sunset mode otherwise

00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,379
we'll get into a hey we ingest

00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,379
everything and sunset nothing so that

00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:04,579
discipline are if you ingest something

00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,889
then you need to have the discipline to

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,740
sunset things that's very important for

00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,850
us and then once you put certain things

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,970
in the container

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,789
what we also do is that we need the

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,939
community to provide our engineers in

00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:22,480
migration routes out of it now there's a

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,860
catch obviously if you say certain

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,559
software or certain solution become tech

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,049
tapped and that Union migrated out of it

00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,750
then you go back into a palletization

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,399
exercise so there's a catch right things

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,869
that are not the right thing to do

00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:38,450
that's a mean that you can be placed

00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:39,950
immediately because we are still

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,789
competing in a way between business

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,669
priorities and technology innovation so

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:48,559
but that's how we handle the balance

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:50,590
between we want to be as loose as

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,660
possible in terms of

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,840
encouraging innovation but we still want

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,420
a community driven approach to contain

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,730
or to create a list of things for people

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:07,400
to use okay

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:10,660
listen learn from here is how many of

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,490
you have let's say a large group of

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,500
directors linear director level engineer

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,580
very senior universe

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:26,330
I mean organization so how many of those

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:28,760
engineers you have 50 have you try have

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:32,110
these 50 folks in a phone call or in a

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,110
room and ask them to agree on something

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:44,540
yeah and when that happens how often do

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:47,330
they actually agree very good so very

00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:50,150
similarly right because we want a group

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,580
of our top and genius and we promote

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:55,040
them based on their thought leadership

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,260
and they're strong opinionated about

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,570
technology guess what you get like 40 of

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,750
them in a room and say hey let's agree

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,750
on this technology formerly for this

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,090
particular use case is hard but if we

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,270
don't do that by the way you have to pay

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,100
the bullet if you don't do that then

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:17,660
none of them will skin again the goal is

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:21,170
that we want our top engineers to do the

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,570
governance for architecture so that they

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,550
agree on the list of standard they help

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,120
drive the open-source policy they drive

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,610
the adoption and then they help us in a

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,280
way work with their engineers day to day

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,140
because we are not going to be like work

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,150
with engineers like every single day so

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,210
we rely on the principle engineers to do

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:44,300
that so yes it is difficult for them to

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,370
agree as a community because you do not

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,260
get into a very senior level engineer

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,990
without being a strong opinion person

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,540
most of them at least but once you get

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:58,130
them to agree then you get skin in the

00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:01,010
game for this process all right so you

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,620
may say wait a second not every single

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,760
company have an large group of

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:10,610
Technology come

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:12,560
so we actually did build it so when the

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,140
same time we start our transformation

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,000
and start our open-source program we

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,420
also start what we call a career leader

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,480
program so we have executive sponsorship

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:27,530
to help promote mentor and higher

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,850
principal and distinguished being

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,700
director and senior director level

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,230
engineers for Express Scripts so what we

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,380
find out is that initially when we start

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,990
all the program but like oh we have like

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,120
three to five like that level engineer

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:45,680
to start what it won't work among scale

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:48,350
so we purposely say hey it's in exactly

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,820
we need to grow that community so that

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,390
we can increase our agility and

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,010
innovation so for all the other stuff I

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,710
talked about to work you need to have a

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,990
strong technology community and we

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,240
purposely grow with that community so

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,100
that they will drive and manage like

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,750
almost all the ingestion maintenance in

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,080
governor's right so architectures role

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:12,410
is to help manage the process manager

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,690
playbook but the actual execution are in

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,310
the technology community again the

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:21,910
prerequisite is that you need to build a

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:24,980
community it takes time

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:28,250
when we start the career program three

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,250
years ago we have about five engineers

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,190
and over time three and a half years

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,280
later we have almost 40 so some of them

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:40,310
we promote and some of them we hire from

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,250
external companies we also have a

00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,540
explicit mentorship program for some of

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,600
senior engineers so that they can grow

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:51,380
into the next level what we find out a

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,300
lot of times is that there is a there's

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,330
an interesting fine line between like

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,540
doing your job very well and executing

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,370
and next level so we provide a lot of an

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,810
engineer's mentorship to help them

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,180
understand what does it mean to get the

00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:07,250
next level and again it takes time to

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,690
grow the community you can't just like I

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,490
don't want to more I'm gonna hire 40

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,410
people I have like 40 whacks out there

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,870
it doesn't work the other thing it is

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:18,160
important is that whoever get promoted

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:21,880
higher need time to earn and gain with

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,680
from the ingenuity so that there's a lot

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,870
of these that takes time to do because

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,140
trust and respect takes time to build

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,820
within the broader community as well

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,180
okay I have like two and a half minutes

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,330
left if you look at a quick week at work

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,590
while just talk about if you look at

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,020
what are the pillars of an open source

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,360
ingestion program so we start with the

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,430
legal side of things because we want to

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,750
streamline a lot of that as much as

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:53,110
possible then we move into a balance

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,870
between the ivory tower and almost all

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,600
our ways of technology footprint so we

00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:02,980
build a technology for movie to have

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:07,660
contained that but at the end if you

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:11,460
need the program to scale the governance

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:14,440
and the management have to be federated

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,320
so the key thing is that you can't have

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,880
let's say a architecture team of five

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,330
people that make all the decisions for

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,690
the company right you need to defer and

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,030
factor those decisions to the larger

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,750
community but it takes time to grow the

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:34,390
community and the community need to also

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:40,450
gain the respect for the folks they work

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:44,290
with day today so that's it for me I

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:46,330
have a minute and a half any questions

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:51,130
for me hopefully it's useful for

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:58,780
everybody and this light is like killing

00:23:51,130 --> 00:24:01,320
me by the way like I'm blind is it clear

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,320
or is it confusing

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,260
thank you

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,260
[Applause]

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,940
