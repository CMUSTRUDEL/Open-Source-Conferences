[Music]

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:20,310
hi everyone so let's talk about trust to

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,810
begin with maybe I can provide you with

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,939
my credentials good way to begin right

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,029
so I work with scent and air scent in

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,840
there I'm there I'm the global head of

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,820
identity

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,940
if you don't know Santa and air it is a

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,149
very big bank 144 million customers

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,450
based in Spain but global before that I

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,700
was global head of api's at AIG before

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:51,360
that helped found the company NPM Inc

00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,539
who here uses node and PM just a few ok

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,539
good

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,920
I helped bring in the node project at

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,230
Giant helped raise a hundred million for

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,300
them before that I was with Ernst and

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,040
Young and the financial services

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,939
advisory practice which is centered just

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,619
down the street and before that I was

00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:14,520
derivatives quantit Wells Fargo so I

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,909
know a little bit about finance and I

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,720
know a little bit about open source and

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:26,210
all of that means that I value trust so

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:30,570
we have a problem in our digital world

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:34,170
we lack trust these days Trust is very

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,079
hard to find Facebook recently announced

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,340
that this year alone they have had to

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,070
delete 5.4 billion with ABI billion

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,780
accounts that's more accounts than they

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,720
have over the course of the year

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,579
two-thirds of it is fake they say at any

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,920
one point in time five percent is fake

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,479
but it's enormous and the number of fake

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,329
accounts that they're deleting is

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,579
growing quarter by quarter

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,700
just as the damage being done by those

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,619
fake accounts is growing we have another

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,740
problem

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,989
privacy McKinsey says that thirty three

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,530
point eight percent of all fraud

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:17,819
globally is identity theft and account

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,560
takeover so anybody with a bank anybody

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,360
working at a bank this is one of your

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,709
key issues this is one of your biggest

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:30,049
problems as banks for the folks that are

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,049
with banks we also have another problem

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:37,230
the problem is potential total

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,500
disintermediation who controls identity

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:46,069
who verifies who people claim to be who

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,480
owns your data you own it is somebody

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,780
trusted custodian taking care of your

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,319
data or potentially is it something else

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,120
if it's something else as banks if it's

00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,829
big tech coast we face total

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,500
disintermediation and total

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:08,280
disintermediation it's not like Total

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:10,130
Recall it's more like terminator I think

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:17,870
that's not going to be good for anybody

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:20,450
so can we help well Oh Maybach one

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,850
that's too bad

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,190
there we go maybe it's a coincidence

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,180
she's wearing Santander red anybody

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,849
remember the 1984 commercial because

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,220
banks can help and they they definitely

00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:40,139
have helped historically Banco de Medici

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,599
since the time of the founding of the

00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:46,049
first major global bank we have been

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,290
helping we funded trade we set up

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,630
letters of credit we helped fund the

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,400
library that built the Renaissance that

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,970
created the demand for the printing

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,889
press that funded Michelangelo that led

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,590
to the enlightenment that led to math

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,760
that led to science that led to history

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,760
and then there was a big bang

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:12,630
well a big bank anyway and if it comes

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,430
from a big bank it means that we can

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:20,340
solve the problem of digital trust banks

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:24,420
protects privacy you know about ancient

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,700
things like doctor-patient privilege you

00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,710
know about lawyer-client confidentiality

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,900
these are not things that have just

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,410
arrived in the last 25 years since the

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,650
advent of HTML no these are old things

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,950
just like bank customer privacy and

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,720
there are huge regulations around it we

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,610
all are dealing with all of these

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,650
regulations that very serious they're a

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,450
big part of our lives we take our

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,240
fiduciary responsibilities very

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,100
seriously if Congress asks us to show up

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,720
or any other government asks us to show

00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:02,160
up we show up and customers appreciate

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,410
it 71% of customers trust banks with

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,900
their personal information this is more

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,230
than anything else out there more than

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,900
any digital entity any of them so being

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,750
regulated doing all the things that we

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,730
have to do gives us an advantage so how

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,290
do we use that advantage how do banks

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:26,610
help our clients prosper how do we help

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:30,240
build digital trust let's go through

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,720
some ideas one idea would be to go with

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,410
something like Bank ID in the Nordics

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,600
anybody familiar with it the Nordics

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:44,190
well seriously I mean life is just

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,740
better in the Nordics it's great but it

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,130
requires good government and on the

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,070
world stage getting agreement is more

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,180
difficult and they have maybe more

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:59,070
pressing concerns

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,870
climate war famine so maybe let's go

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,240
with a market-based solution if we're

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,730
looking for a global solution one idea

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,120
is to go with one company and I love

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,010
these diagrams because we've passed it

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,570
in the diagrams that means the one

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,140
company is sitting in the middle making

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,350
all the money which is great I mean it

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,320
worked for the brilliant mr. Bloomberg

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,570
and I like Mike I think he's great but

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,070
I'm sure we can solve the the whole

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,110
problem of digital trust without

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:32,610
manufacturing another brilliant

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,930
billionaire so maybe we can get some

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,590
guidance from the market what's the

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:40,050
market telling us we talked to some

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,270
matching engines matching engines that

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,620
connect a buyer and a seller either

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,630
sides of a party eBay Airbnb uber they

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,670
all said the same thing oh this is great

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,740
you can verify who can give me verified

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,260
sellers verified buyers you can give me

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,990
verified renters you can give me

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,700
verified landlords you can help us to

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,810
credit who the people are on the

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,580
platform fantastic but we don't want to

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,590
integrate once with Santa and air and

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,540
then a completely different format with

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,060
somebody else and a completely different

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,970
format with yet another company what the

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,510
market wants is a standard makes sense

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,600
right

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:22,050
okay so what this tells us is no bank

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,300
can go it alone no bank can impose their

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,670
solution and hope that the rest of the

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,700
world adopts it we have to work together

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,440
if banks build just their own solution

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,720
they're gonna end up with a really nice

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:41,670
store in a ghost town and standards work

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,010
look at HTML look at tcp/ip can banks

00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,410
make a standard how many folks know

00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:50,510
about FP ml financial product markup

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:54,780
language cool like my derivatives beeps

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,670
ice LIBOR great standard central to all

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,620
of our major financial contracts these

00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,060
days you're at all our futures another

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,900
big standard helps us to hedge

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,450
everything big part of how we add more

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,580
stability to market these days so at

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:14,090
center there we're doing a research

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,090
project they told me to keep it stealth

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,660
no tweets

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:24,030
the trusted counterparty protocol or the

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,430
trusted counterparty protocol for ID

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,010
that's our working title I don't know

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,120
maybe we change it but right now it's

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,890
TCP for ID and what it's supposed to

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,050
tell you with that little Amash is that

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,030
it really is a standard there's no

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,270
central group there's no central

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:45,720
organizing entity there is instead just

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,780
a standard we can all use it's built on

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,820
top of open ID it's really easy to

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,770
conceptualize there's somebody who holds

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,240
identity they go to a reliance party

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,610
they say hey I want to check into your

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,190
hotel and the hotel says give me your

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,660
passport and the person says no you're

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,280
Mary it and last time you lost my

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,400
passport along with a hundred million

00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,430
other passports so uh how about I verify

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,180
with my bank the message gets sent to

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,950
the bank the person checks in with the

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,660
bank the bank uses their existing

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,550
identity and access management system

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,500
this is what I run for scent and air I

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,260
know you all have it it's easy to run

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,720
it's easy to extend with this system and

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,410
then the message gets sent off to the

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,530
hotel it's a little bit like outsourcing

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:35,120
PCI compliance for example so well what

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:39,090
do we have today we have code real code

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,840
come to our session where we're going on

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:47,330
in on I think it's stage two at 3:10

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,070
this afternoon join us you'll hear from

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,240
Ildefonso al meadow

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,730
he's the director of innovation at

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,260
Santander UK he's responsible for

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,990
research and development for proofs of

00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,140
concepts and delivering new high profile

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:05,100
innovation programs this is one of them

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,320
you'll hear for from Alberto Pulido I

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:12,150
think I left a spelling mistake in there

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:15,300
forgot the I apologize Alberto he's the

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:18,150
technical expert behind the standard you

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,670
met Buuren Strasser up earlier I've

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,010
worked with the people who created an

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,840
NPM Alberto is on the same level the

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,420
guy's a genius and what he's building

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,420
with his team is really really

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,610
interesting and what will employ you to

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,920
do afterwards

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,529
is to join us we're creating a working

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,810
group we're working towards open

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,550
sourcing all of this working with our

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,640
colleagues and other banks to create

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,550
something that fundamentally changes the

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,740
nature of digital trust I think we'll be

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,450
able to completely change the way people

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:55,459
interact online I think it'll help make

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,070
commerce more secure I think it'll help

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,899
us to trust each other better I think it

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,720
will also have an impact when it comes

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,430
to things like our discourse you can

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,829

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:12,070
Santander Co UK and that's it thank you

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,070

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,659
[Applause]

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,369
