I want to welcome in Alejandro Vallarta

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,500
our chair from city and those cats our

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,520
Vice Chair from Morgan Stanley thank you

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,400
folks thank you for being here all right

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,680
thank you god wow this is a terrific

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,810
crowd thank you guys so much for coming

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,730
out today

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:35,270
dokin I are absolutely thrilled to be

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,920
here representing the finest board I

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,629
think talking about the opportunities

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,969
around open source and financial

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,120
services was definitely the easy part of

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,399
the speech or joven me figuring out the

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,190
dress code for an event combining

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,840
finance and open source was way trickier

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,149
so they would let us into the costume

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,789
room yeah exactly

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,370
so to give you all a little bit more

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,770
color on the fee nose board we have

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,570
board members from the Southside board

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,189
members from the buy side from pin tech

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,220
companies and from open source companies

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,890
and we think that this diversity is

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,680
absolutely essential in shaping our

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,299
direction in our strategy board members

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,820
also come from different parts the

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,369
organization from technology and from

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,229
the business which is key is gab

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,880
mentioned to shaping views and

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,710
understanding around how different

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,850
projects will provide different kinds of

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,650
value for example the financial objects

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,259
working group one that's near and dear

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,579
to my heart for those of you I know

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,740
we're working on a common language

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,259
around fixed income instruments in

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,540
objects and want to eventually become a

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,299
place where standards creators and

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,520
consumers can come together I think we

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,280
can really reduce innovation friction

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,350
with this effort another very exciting

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,720
example is a recently launched cloud

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,759
certification project which will benefit

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,100
the entire industry by developing a

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,469
common set of tests and test frameworks

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,500
available for any institution looking to

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,659
accelerate adoption of the cloud so as

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,060
board members we have a dual role right

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,920
on the one hand we represent the firms

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,390
that we come from to

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,650
helped shape the industry work with

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,450
finis and all that but on the other hand

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,480
and much more important and equally

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,100
important is trying to drive sponsorship

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,260
locally within our companies around

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,670
open-source and that comes in many

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,819
different shapes whether you need the

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,340
junior senior sponsorship and all that

00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:32,760
the open-source involvement in the

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,380
financial industry is very unbalanced at

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,450
the moment we consume a ton of

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,190
open-source our ability to contribute

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,660
back is often constrained by the

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,090
regulatory environment that we operate

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,950
in and maybe sometimes the complexity

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,690
and age of some of our technology that

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,310
requires a little bit of cleaning up or

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,810
Gennaro sizing before we can just make

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,060
it available more generally so as we

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,830
take a look or as we looked at what it

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,660
would take to contribute we evaluated

00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,489
what we thought were the real risks and

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,769
what we thought were maybe some

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,870
perceived risks figured out how to

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,330
effectively manage and mitigate some of

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,459
those risks and determined for sure that

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,050
the value and benefit to be gained from

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,760
collaborating through open-source is

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,910
absolutely worth the effort

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,799
but that worth it takes different shapes

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,769
for different firms and everybody has a

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,299
different tipping point I think for

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,519
example the opportunity we have to

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,130
reduce frictions around the digitization

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,079
of capital markets is a huge example of

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,690
both innovation and time to market

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,310
benefit other benefits we have are

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,450
around talent attraction and talent

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,430
retention I think you're going to hear a

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,650
bit more about that soon which are

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,940
really a challenge when we want to bring

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,260
in people that are familiar with some of

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,730
the open-source libraries that are

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,079
popular in the industry you want to be

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,600
able to start at a starting point

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,160
without having to retrain so each

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,980
organization has to create a value

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,049
framework to create understanding of

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,079
what makes open-source right for you and

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,000
in doing so that requires again as we

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,220
mentioned earlier at bottom bottom-up

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,290
sponsorship top-down sponsorship

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,329
in technology in the business and you

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,280
might have people that are sharing code

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,049
across teams in a form of inter sourcing

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
model you might have other cases where

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,280
you want to collaborate with vendors and

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,810
partners and and peers in the industry

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,049
to help solve problems that just aren't

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,940
worth solving alone it's also important

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,760
to understand both the general industry

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,760
challenges to adoption as well as the

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,770
firm's specific challenges in order

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,930
figure out how to address them for

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,300
example getting legal and compliance and

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,430
risk colleagues on board and working

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,560
collectively to change a culture that

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,810
candidly has not always embraced

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,090
collaboration do we have anybody from

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,570
the room right now in legal compliance

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,340
or risk functions anyone no okay can we

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,880
give him a round of applause thank you

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,200
for coming

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,720
I think this partnership is crucial to

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,210
making this process move forward so when

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,980
we mitigate the risks and challenges and

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,900
when we tackle them then we can help

00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,410
create the value identify the value and

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,130
really move everything forward we are so

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,780
pleased

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,540
Dogen I and on behalf of the entire

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,010
famous board to and be involved not only

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,050
with the organization but with this

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,270
conference today and we hope it gives

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,370
you some idea of what open-source and

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,930
financial services can do as well as

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,020
some of the exciting things that we have

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,390
going on in the foundation today you'll

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,390
hear about established projects like FDC

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,400
3 or desktop interoperability and

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,500
something exciting new projects as well

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,510
such as the cloud certification program

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,700
and other initiatives that focus on

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,090
regulation and even delivering

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,650
compliance as code yeah so open source I

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,150
think people in this room will agree on

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,730
the size of the crowd is a testament to

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,080
that is good for individuals it's good

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,000
for companies it's really just good for

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,770
business so if you're not involved right
