00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,170
so you know I don't think it's any

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,910
accident that this collaboration is

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,189
happening in New York not only because

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,449
all the banks are here but I also think

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,400
there's some magic that's really

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,480
happening and has been happening for a

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,840
long time within the ecosystem we have a

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,460
special tech community here and Julie a

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,290
good friend of mine is gonna talk a

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,700
little bit about you know what makes New

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,219
York special and what makes our tech

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,600
community really great it wasn't always

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,329
like this in New York

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,149
having a vibrant tech sector here in New

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,280
York has been a slog and now we're

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,170
starting to really see validation of

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,239
what an amazing tech community we have

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:58,260
so without any further ado I'll

00:00:51,239 --> 00:01:00,510
introduce Julie Samuels thank you so

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,589
much for having me this is such a great

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,090
event in such a great New York space I

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:08,460
started and run an organization called

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,020
tech NYC they move around a little is

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,549
that okay also I'm the only thing

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,049
keeping you guys from lunch so I'm gonna

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,000
be really quick tech NYC is a coalition

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,430
we're now about 800 companies and

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,290
investors strong working to represent

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,970
the tech ecosystem here to make sure

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,979
that New York City is the best place to

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,869
build and grow tech companies but even

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,909
more than that we spend a lot of time

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,549
thinking about how we can take the tech

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,979
industry and make sure that its support

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,659
in New York City and we're so incredibly

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,520
bullish on what's happening in New York

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,259
and I'm so incredibly bullish on what's

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,630
happening here today and with this

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,090
community because I think when we kind

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,090
of look at where New York is and where

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,070
New York is going part of what makes New

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,070
York so exciting is that there's so much

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,460
existing industry here that historically

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,110
might not be thought of as tech but I

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,479
don't have to tell you guys this

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,369
increasingly every company is a tech

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,869
company I mean how do you even define it

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,969
anymore

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:08,610
everyone needs to hire engineers right

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,790
of some some kind or another at this

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,440
point and so when you think about what a

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,180
successful firm look

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,430
like going forward it's going to require

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,950
technical talent but it's also going to

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,380
require the skills and the talent that

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,450
come with whatever sector you're

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,930
building and right and and we have that

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,830
all here in New York we have that

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,990
obviously with finance which I'm going

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,450
to talk about in just a second but real

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,520
estate and fashion and media and

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,010
advertising and you know you name it so

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,860
again I'm incredibly bullish on where

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,960
the general tech market and ecosystem is

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,490
going here in New York when I think

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,020
about that though and I think about kind

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,770
of you know the broader of FinTech

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,500
market where finance is in general that

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:57,450
is the model right that is the model for

00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:02,850
how New York can foster the development

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:04,290
of a true robust ecosystem and this is

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,540
the part and why I'm so excited to be

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,730
here today and why I'm so excited about

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,200
the conversations you guys are having

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,960
today in the work that finest is doing

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,320
in general and it's that I'm the one

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,070
hand the tech sector will come to New

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,010
York and and will always be just a part

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,450
of New York right it's not like some

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,100
other cities where it will be a tech

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,400
town you know it's going to be one of

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,200
many industries here and that's good

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,480
actually I think but but I'm also so

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,810
interested in how we take the best parts

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,790
of our culture of the tech culture and

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,820
in this instance I would the open source

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,880
culture and how we bring that to the

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,920
kind of the broader New York ecosystem

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,080
and I do a ton work with government in

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,239
politics and kind of Landa policy so

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,180
especially in that instance you know the

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,670
the creativity the cultural openness

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,489
that is inherent in what you guys all do

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,880
is something that is so important beyond

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,670
just the specs it is so important in the

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,739
culture of how we bring smart people to

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,830
the table to talk about and to share

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,630
ideas and I so fundamentally believe

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,670
that and that is why I'm so excited to

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,169
be here today I'm so excited to see all

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,549
of you having these important

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,820
conversations right here in New York

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,470
City I you know for those of you who

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,450

chance to eat some really good New York

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,680
food and really

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,840

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,660
and we we really we hope you come back

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,729
because New York is is I really believe

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,639
ground zero for the next generation of

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,979
tech companies you know the big tech

00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,900
companies and so I know I will be seeing

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,520
and hearing a lot more from all of you

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,070
