	Ibrahim Haddad | Linux Foundation AI Foundation | Improving the Impact of your Enterprise Open Source Development and Participation | FINOS OSSF 2019

Ibrahim Haddad, Executive Director, Linux Foundation AI Foundation

Enterprise open source development and involvement has its own set of challenges, but it becomes easier if you have a clear plan to follow. If you're one of the growing list of companies that relies on open source software for their products and services, investing time and money into improving your open source practices can pay off immensely in the long run. Fortunately, there are many success stories of companies getting involved and becoming leaders in various open source domains that they charted a path you can follow to improve your own contributions and aim for a leadership role.

This talk offers a practical guide to a number of practices that enterprises can adopt to help them grow their footprint in open source projects. Furthermore, the talk touches on the challenges enterprises face and how to overcome them.

[Music]

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
good afternoon everyone

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,880
my name is ibrahim haddad i work at the

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
linux foundation and today

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,720
i'm very happy to be here with you to

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
talk about improving open source

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,279
enterprise practices

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
so the genesis of this talk comes from

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
a lot of discussions i've had with

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,399
colleagues of mine where

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399
we look back and we see there's about 20

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,840
20 plus years of experience enterprise

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,600
experience in companies

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
uh joining kind of the open source

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
ecosystem building projects becoming

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
part of communities

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,399
and the thinking was you know how can we

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
distill a lot of the

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,840
uh knowledge gained from these practices

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
and pass it

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,120
to newcomers who wants to get involved

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,280
as companies

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
in open source in projects in that part

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,039
of ecosystem

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
so that they can learn from all the

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,600
right things that these companies that

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,280
came before them you know did and also

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
learn from their mistake and avoid them

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,880
so that their curve would be a lot

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,680
uh faster in this space so this is where

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
where we are um i was under the

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
impression

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
the talk was 45 minutes it's 25 minutes

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
um

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,799
so i'm gonna be going a little bit fast

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
on some of these slides so

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
uh one basic chart why open source a lot

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
of the people

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,799
you know often refer to you know faster

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
time to market

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
leverage engineering development uh in

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,680
all of these kind of very practical

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
tangible ways

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
uh in my thinking i always think of it

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
really at a little bit

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
for a higher level from a strategic

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
perspective and

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,399
i identify six seasons here i'm just

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,479
going to go through them very quickly

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,920
for us we look at open source as another

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,079
tool in your toolbox

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
right so you work with vcs you work with

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,840
startups you work with incubators

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,520
you have your internal internal r d and

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,439
similar to all of these different pieces

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,240
your open source is one tool that you

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,759
can use to help you with whatever you're

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,200
going to build whether in financial

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,960
industry and telecom and consumer

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,840
electronics or whatnot

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,720
software is extremely critical um you

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,760
know there's the famous

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,480
uh you know um open software is eating

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,800
the word

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
uh today's open source is doing software

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
and just to indicate that you cannot

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,160
really build anything today

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,840
uh without using open source of course

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
you can but it's not really a smart move

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
why would you want to go create a new

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
open source

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,599
um you know or create a new operating

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
system or any kind of piece of software

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
that already exists as a collaborative

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,519
effort right

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,200
uh very flexible licensing model uh

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
product dependency so this is actually a

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
chart from

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
when i was running the samsung open

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
source division

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
and i used this chart every time i was

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
raising money for my group

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,160
and it's basically every product we ship

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
uses anywhere between 30 to 70 percent

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
of open source code in it

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,680
so why do we need to invest in this

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,160
domain it's because of this chart right

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,720
um and then product enablement it allows

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,640
us to

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,640
do a lot of enablement both direct and

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,840
direct in terms of you know features or

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
roadmap or dependency and then somebody

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
earlier today i heard them talk about

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
the 80 20 factor

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,239
uh this is really very uh core to the

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,040
open source principle

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
in in the fact it it in how it allows

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
you to

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
be more innovative you know developers

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
in your org

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,280
are better used to spending their time

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
on the value that your consumers want to

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,239
go and that's why they buy the product

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,000
versus buying on

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,840
spending their time on really enabling

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,159
stuff

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
so smart companies today must have an

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,239
open source strategy and it is

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
you can actually avoid that and it is

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
typically part of

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,319
a larger software strategy under which

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,440
you know open source is a big umbrella

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
and in the past few years we've seen a

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,319
lot of

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
activities around what is today called

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,159
ospo open source program office

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,040
uh which is basically the office within

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,280
a given company that is responsible for

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,640
um kind of open source a to z you know

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,439
whether it's compliance

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
consuming policies processes and whatnot

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,560
and

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,080
um it grew so much that we actually at

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
the linux foundation will launch the to

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
do group which is a group of like-minded

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
companies

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
uh that have their own open source

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
program offices we have about a hundred

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,760
companies there

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
it's a free to join and participate and

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,239
they have their own events and it's

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,479
basically it acts as a

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,600
knowledge sharing across peers and one

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,199
of the interesting thing is

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
every year they do their survey and i

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,560
have a few charts

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,080
through my presentation all these um the

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
the survey results are available on

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,960
github so you can go and fetch them

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,080
uh so you can see here um the survey

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,880
um open source programs are overwhelming

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
beneficial

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
compliance better call quality better

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
market time to market better security

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
cost saving and whatnot

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,440
right so there are obviously a lot of

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
value add in in these program offices

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,240
and what's interesting is these actually

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
offices existed way way back you know

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,320
they had different names you know in

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,479
2005 i was working at erickson

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
and we had what we called the open

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,600
systems lab

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,720
because we were under research and our

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
our focus was

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
how can we bring linux and open source

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
up to a point where we can really deploy

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,600
them in telecom environments

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,440
right so we were not called open source

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
program offices a new terminology but

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,160
the idea is not really new

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,680
uh so the phases of open source journey

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
uh there has been actually part of

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
aaron's panel earlier today about

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
you know how companies where did they

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,280
start and how do they move

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,039
so um it's really typical for companies

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
to start with consumption

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,039
um you know engineers the developers

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
getting over source code testing

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,560
uh experiencing with it if it meets

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,680
their you know criteria in terms of

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
functions and whatnot

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,520
they start deploying it and then as a

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,960
consequence of that

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,479
you have to comply i mean you ship a

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
product with open source because you

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
know you did open source incorporated

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,360
you have to comply then you have the

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,440
compliance piece

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,039
and over time you build that appetite to

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
contribute because you want to influence

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,440
the

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
direction of the projects you're relying

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,319
on for your products you contribute and

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,160
over time you're like

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
hey this is really working i want to

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
influence a lot more and i will

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
want to build a leadership position in

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,080
the key projects or communities

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,840
that are critical to my product or

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
services

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
so the first common part is the

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,039
compliance and consumption and

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
compliance

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,479
and what i have here on the chart is

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,680
basically

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,560
a lot of the enabling or building blocks

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,440
so that you have very solid um

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
consumption

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,199
and compliance um environment in

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,479
in in the enterprise so of course you

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,120
need strategy

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,800
uh a portal for you know hosting and all

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,600
the knowledge inside the company

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
uh policy and processes uh how do we use

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
open source where do we use it

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,160
under which conditions you know all of

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,639
these and a process to automate all of

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,280
that

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
uh typically companies request that

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
their developers

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,080
have permission to use specific um

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,360
components you know under different

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,440
licenses and there has

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
to be a process that captures that and

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,759
documented

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,840
um you know a lot of education tooling

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,080
to be in place for all the automation

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,800
uh you know i remember back in you know

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,520
early 2000s i was at motorola and

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,080
we used to have a word document going

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
over

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
you know five six different people to

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
get the approval for

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
uh using open source and that's one

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,400
document per component

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,800
we cannot do that we're using hundreds

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,599
and in a consumer electronic environment

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
where otherwise

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,720
you know a year ago it's thousands of

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,440
components

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
um so a lot of tooling in place and

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
there's a lot of initiatives that

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,120
companies can get involved in

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
to first learn and also to participate

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,520
and and

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,360
be more influential in specific

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,440
uh compliance initiatives or projects so

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,360
the next part is participation as i

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,120
mentioned earlier so okay we are now at

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
a point where we're consuming a lot

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
and my advice to to to my teams in the

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
past

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,520
was you know don't go jumping just

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
contributing

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,879
you know sign up to the mailing list uh

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,120
sign up to the you know irc

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,800
to the chat figuring out who's who's

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,720
there what other companies are present

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,199
what are they doing why they're doing it

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,240
uh how does that uh relate to what we

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
want to do you know kind of

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,520
that kind of uh knowledge learn that

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
knowledge

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,680
and then we already uh you know equipped

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,440
with with this information to proceed

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
into the contribution side

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,759
and it's always kind of critical where

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,400
uh we have limited resources

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,720
i mean i worked at a company with over

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,599
40 000 developers it's a 300 000

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
people company um and i only had 100

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,279
people

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,279
so we cannot 100 people go and you know

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,560
do everything the company was doing in

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,360
open source so we had to be extremely

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,959
selective

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,959
and we created basically a process to

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,800
figure out um you know what's the bill

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,839
of material for all our open source

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,839
across all products select the top 25

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
following is you know specific criteria

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
and focus on these right so have to be

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,320
very selective otherwise

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,519
um you know it's all hell

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,240
uh opens loose in the sense where um it

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,880
becomes very hard to to to prove a lot

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,080
of impact anywhere

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
and then once of course the company

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,959
moves into contribution uh the

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
contribution space there's other

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
elements that you need to build within

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,279
the company

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
to enable that whether it's a policy for

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,800
contribution a process for that

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,320
um uh educating the uh community within

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,880
the company the developers

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
you know supply chain and and and others

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
on how to work with the contribution

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
side

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,720
and there's some different uh you know

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,360
standard or

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,160
foundation work that um you can get

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
involved

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
in to improve that uh your your your

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,200
contribution aspect

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,360
and of course a lot of companies who

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,240
started early um

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
um you know kind of paved the way to

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,640
what we

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
think of today as an open source

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
leadership okay so when you know when

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,000
you think of ibm

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,680
in 2000 they announced their investing 1

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
billion dollars in linux and then in

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,959
like 2010 they invested

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,720
um they announced another billion in

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
open source cloud and so on so these are

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
kind of the three blazers and

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
um and today a lot of companies look at

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
these you know

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
you know intel ibm to google and so i

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,920
want to say you know we want to be

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,120
leaders in these in the projects that we

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,600
care about like these

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
companies our leaders in their space and

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
of course that requires a lot of

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
investment i mean it requires increased

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
head count in

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
engineering to focus on upstream

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,880
development it requires

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,079
um you know increased head counting in

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,160
legal uh

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,440
and and really across the board and a

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,160
lot more focus on

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
where do we spend and and how do we uh

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
how do we

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,440
spend that um of course companies

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
transition you start as being a consumer

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
then suddenly you're

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
you know you're shipping you have to

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
comply and then um

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,920
you realize you know if this project

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,399
dies we're pretty much

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,920
screwed on our uh product so we need to

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,279
get involved and you know participate

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
and keep the community alive and build

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
it and have

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,640
a thriving ecosystem around it and you

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,279
know it's um

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,959
over time you start and then you improve

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,880
and you transition from one

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,640
to another and one thing i found really

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,440
interesting in the uh

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,480
ospo open source program office survey

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,839
uh was that

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,240
uh this chart uh that states you know

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
uh the financial industry which is

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
pretty much our host today in a way

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,200
um they are actually a lot more using

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,600
open source

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
and they're contributing a lot less and

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
i thought well

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
this is perfect because the rest of my

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,959
presentation is actually on

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,720
focus on practices that you can pass on

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,360
to companies involved in this

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,360
uh industry and one thing i'd like to

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,279
kind of share is that

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,959
since the 2000s you know i was involved

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,440
in at ericsson at motorola

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,320
palm hp linux foundation a couple times

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,880
samsung

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
so and we've had these discussions a lot

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,560
of different industries

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,760
and within different companies in the

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
technology verticals

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,519
and everybody thought they're special

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,480
you know at the beginning of times

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,920
telecom you know the operators and the

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,120
you know the rx and nokia

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
cisco you know um alcatel

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,560
lucent you know these these kind of

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,480
asian companies now

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,240
they thought they're very special uh you

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
know or they're highly regulated and all

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,399
that

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,399
you know today all of telecom

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,040
infrastructure is actually based on open

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,200
source

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,880
the mobile came next and then you know

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,120
all the industries start to default

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,040
so finance is not really special it's

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,560
just like another kid on the block

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,399
that just learned about open source and

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,000
they're trying to see how they can play

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,680
with it and benefit from it

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,519
um so um so recommended practices i

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,720
actually have 17 of them i will try to

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
kind of be a little bit quick because

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
that's

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
you know half a minute per each and then

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,399
we're done um so

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
there was actually earlier on the panel

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,279
that aaron moderated

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
a discussion about open source program

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,760
offices um

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,959
so um so one of the first practices that

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
i would recommend is to create that

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,760
office

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,200
and i actually just recently a little

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,760
kind of self-promotion

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
um about a week ago i published a piece

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,800
on linkedin on

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,880
uh what is the open source program

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,320
office how can you structure it

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
in a given company and there are

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,680
different ways you can structure it what

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
are the roles and how can you staff it

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,720
who should be on it

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
uh for each specific scenario what are

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
the responsibilities

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,720
and what are the challenges they're

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
gonna face and all of that so if you're

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,639
interested in this i highly

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,560
recommend you you know you by checking

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,519
it out uh and you know of course every

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
company is different

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,720
i worked in companies where it was

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,480
part-time different people

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
and all the way up to a configuration

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,240
where you know over 100 people focused

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,160
on that

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,519
number two is hire or promote a leader

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,040
for the open source office a lot of

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
companies you know start building up

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,920
their operation and they go higher from

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,399
the outside and

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,240
i urge companies first to look inside

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,760
okay that open source build up that led

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
you to a point where you're ready to go

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
and

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
figure out and think that we need a

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,760
leader for this position it's because

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,760
somebody

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
inside the company or multiple people

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,839
actually work together

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,440
to get there um so i'm pretty sure you

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,120
have somebody from within the company

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,639
who can help with that

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
identify your reliance on open source

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
software this is one of the

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
really important and critical components

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,920
um

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,160
and one of the things i would recommend

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,399
is you know we're starting off

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,079
um where are we using open source in

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,760
which product in which capacity

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,440
how critical it is for this specific

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,839
product um and

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
and uh or service and then build that

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,120
criticality aspect there

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,519
where you're trying to figure out you

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
know i have this much budget

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,959
so many people where do i put them and

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
of course you know put them on the most

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
critical

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,519
open source projects from that

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,600
perspective

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,480
um and um uh one thing as a fundraiser

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
because open source offices or divisions

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,519
are

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,279
a cost center and every year you have to

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
go as the head of the division or

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
the head of the office you have to go

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,000
and fundraise for your team

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,040
and it really really helps a lot if

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,199
the output of your team targets multiple

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,440
divisions or multiple products

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,000
because in that case number one are you

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,000
able to

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,000
to get more funding and if one of the

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,880
sources of funding

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
changes due to whatever reason you have

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,480
always a fallback so as

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
a fundraiser for my open source division

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
i always was very careful in making sure

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,839
i have multiple sponsors

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
uh from multiple products and the output

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
benefits

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,360
at least two each output you know each

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,480
each functionality i'm creating

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,440
um benefits at least to

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
different parties and that's you know

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,079
from a fundraising perspective this is

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
really critical

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,680
um identify your current and target

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,560
position you know where are we on the

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,680
map

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,240
are we using are we um just

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,880
interacting are we contributing are we

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,040
opening

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,000
you know where are we on this kind of

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,800
open source

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,160
uh map and where do we wanna get there

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,560
are a lot of companies

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,160
um really major companies who are very

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,680
happy and satisfied to being just a

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
consumer and they don't see an urge or

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,759
need for them to go any further

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,880
so it's it's not really mandatory or

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,560
required but

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,120
all companies have to start and go all

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,279
the way uh it really depends on your

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,040
business strategy and on and on your

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,920
software strategy and open source is

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,360
just as i mentioned

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,399
is a tool to help you um execute on that

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,839
so identify where you are and where you

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,880
want to go and then

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,120
basically chart a path okay i need to do

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
a b and c to get from this point to that

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,279
point

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,880
uh develop and execute a strategy this

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
is kind of a combination of a lot of

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,720
things including the things

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,480
i've i've mentioned earlier uh there are

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
a lot of um

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,839
considerations whether they're technical

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,720
uh related to developer

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,480
to developers or uh uh legal

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,759
considerations or kind of specific

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
product consideration in building an

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
open source strategy

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,240
and my my my thinking on this is it's

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,440
always

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,360
kind of business driven okay um

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
i'm i'm very worried when people call me

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,079
open source guy because i don't consider

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,040
myself an open source guy

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,480
right um i a lot of times i say no and i

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
said no a lot of times and actually in

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
one of the publications i've done

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,279
uh in the open source uh piece i see one

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
of my favorite things is to say no

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
because people come to me and they have

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,360
a lot of requests to open things and

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,600
move things

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,279
and so on and my job is to make sure

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,799
that if we put anything out

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,400
i want to make sure that we have the

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,160
highest chances of success

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,000
and if it doesn't meet my criteria for

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,559
leaving the company then the answer is

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,439
no

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,160
so um so don't afraid don't be afraid of

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,839
saying no

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
it's actually you're helping your open

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,959
source team without them really knowing

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
indirectly implement an open source

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,760
enabling environment

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,280
uh there's a lot of things that to be

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,360
put in place uh and

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,480
you know the previous charts i put you

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,760
know the enabling

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,799
uh building blocks for consuming for

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,679
compliance and and for uh contributing

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,880
so i will not go

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,840
too much uh deep um in the space it is

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
always an issue

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,039
i don't know how this is the case with

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
in the financial industry uh but

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,840
basically in

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,440
any kind of experience i've had before

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,320
with you know whether it's small

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,160
or really large companies um the first

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,559
few months are actually a lot of pain

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,919
okay we're not able to access uh the

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,760
firewall

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,360
the email doesn't work well with

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,400
attaching patches we're not able to

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,919
access github

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
we need to i mean there's it's a

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,520
nightmare and it's in

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,520
in one recent case we actually created

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,559
our own complete infrastructure for the

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,600
open source division

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,120
on um one of the cloud provider we had

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
different email address we were sitting

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,960
on a completely separate network

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
and everybody was extremely happy and

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,840
the cost was like

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,039
one tenth of the cost per month per

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,120
engineer uh so

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,720
making sure that developers and

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,080
engineers are actually enabled from any

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,600
perspective have access to the same

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
tools the same equipment that their

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,400
peers and other companies are

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,960
working on the same projects

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
building expertise uh in different areas

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,960
whether it's technical

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
evangelism community strategy and so on

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,720
and

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
that's not really hard to do basically i

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,640
would personally start by hiring

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,840
a couple anchor hires that will help

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
with education

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,559
creating mentoring programs we've done

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
that

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
and basically teaming up with peers and

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,320
other companies and there are groups

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,320
like the to do groups and

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,919
a few others that help with that kind of

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,039
networking aspect

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,480
where we cannot as a company go and hire

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,679
all the smart people out there so we

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
need to figure out a way to work with

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,919
them

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,360
and we need to figure out a way to tap

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
into their knowledge and experi

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,600
experience and expertise so that we can

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
benefit from it in building our own

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,039
experience in

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,559
whatever company we are and that's part

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,080
of kind of of building that knowledge

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,280
internally because we're not going to go

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,280
and hire

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
every you know networking with to help

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
us shortcut the transaction by

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,600
nanosecond or something like that i mean

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,600
uh create meaningful metrics uh to track

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,559
progress this was mentioned earlier by

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,760
andrew who was on the panel you know

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
development

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
um open source development requires

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
different set of metrics to track

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
uh i'll give you a simple one you know

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,720
if we have a developer who's

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,720
tasked by you know by us to to

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
improve battery use on the cell phone

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,360
because then they need to go and improve

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
the

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,799
uh you know power stop system in the

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,799
linux kernel what if

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
it's not that person's patch that fixed

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,760
the problem and

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,440
it's through his uh uh the discussion he

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,120
or she initiated on the mailing list he

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,000
was able or she was able to

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,760
uh you know they were able to uh entice

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,039
other developers to join them on this

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
and there was kind of a collaborative

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,240
effort

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,840
so with that developer get credit uh and

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
as a result of that get a performance

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
bonus

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,159
in accordance to that well what if they

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
didn't write any piece of the code but

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,480
they advocated for it right

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,440
so there are different metrics uh and uh

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
one of the things that

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,640
we've done and you know even at samsung

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,280
was we created kind of a a ladder

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
for all you know for open source and you

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,000
know you want to be an open source

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
developer you go on that ladder

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
uh different you know different uh

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,799
levels and

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,400
it includes uh you know you want to get

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,960
to a certain position you need to take

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
training

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
and this is how we enforce training you

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
know you want to you want to graduate to

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,000
a software architect which is a really

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,120
respectable title at samsung um you need

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
to take the compliance training the

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
contribution training you know

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,960
there's like 10 courses they need to

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
take um so it and it works really good

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,679
so

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,520
finding the right metrics would really

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,760
drive the proper behavior

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,559
and any kind of irrelevant metric would

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,320
just

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,240
drive the wrong behavior that you would

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,760
hope for

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,600
create or outsource open source training

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
i i mentioned that our company either

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
they they have their own training

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,919
created internally or they go and you

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
know there's a lot of providers out

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,440
there that they work with

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,200
uh to create training open source

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,720
foundation are very critical

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
um i'm not saying this because i work

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,400
for a foundation it's that

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,159
uh this foundation hosts very critical

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,039
projects uh you know fema's hosts a

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,120
number of projects

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,280
the nyx foundation hosts close to 200

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,760
projects mozilla foundation apache and

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,280
several others and these projects are

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,679
hosted in the foundation to provide a

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,320
new

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
home or an open governance structure and

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,200
to make it very easy

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
and kind of worrisome really for

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,640
companies to get involved in

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,559
so in a lot of the projects you're

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,679
probably incorporating in your builds or

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,760
in your products

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,039
i'm pretty sure there are a lot of them

00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,840
that are actually hosted in the

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,840
foundation

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,760
and one way to influence and be part of

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,200
that discussion is to be on the table

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,400
by being part of the foundation and

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,280
attending these meetings and

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,120
participating in events and so on

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,559
uh established framework for open

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,799
sourcing internal code

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
uh if you work for a large company

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
you're gonna see hundreds of requests

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,280
per week

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,120
to open source there has to be a way

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,799
where we can minimize the friction there

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,039
you know if you're if you and and you

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
can structure it any different ways but

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,320
you don't want your legal counsel to get

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,120
100 requests in their queue

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,799
by friday okay to they have to review so

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,880
figuring out a way to structure for

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,520
example if it's just a simple patch

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
minor uh you know minor bug fix is just

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,400
to the discussion of the engineering

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,320
manager if it's a major functionality is

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
up to the discussion of the director

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,480
if there's a patent issue or open

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,600
sourcing a new code then it's it got to

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,280
the legal and so on

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,280
so figuring out a way to scale the

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,679
system without burdening the people and

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,760
kind of creating friction for the

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,159
developer and for whoever the approvals

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
are

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,640
and there are a lot of examples um from

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,320
different companies who actually

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
wrote papers and published on how they

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,080
actually do that uh

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,919
encourage internal collaboration via

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,559
intersourcing so basically resourcing

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,280
practices

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,039
are applying open source development

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,000
methodology within the same company

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,799
and i personally see that as very

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,880
beneficial

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
as a stepping stone in training internal

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,320
developers who haven't worked on open

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
source on doing and

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,720
practicing these uh aspects of

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,799
development within their peers

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,200
before they actually step out and start

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,559
doing that that

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,600
that type of interaction with the

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,600
outside there's really a lot of

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,840
publications and and presentations from

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,440
different companies and even a lot of

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,880
groups of companies that got together

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,760
and and they're sharing their experience

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
a lot so

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,279
if you're interested in this they're

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,760
easily found via a

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,039
search engine uh participate and host

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
open source events

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,480
um whether you know a lot of these

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,360
events are actually technical this is

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
kind of a mix

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,600
you know of strategy policy and whatnot

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
uh but basically

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,720
um as an engineering manager in you know

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,039
in a previous role

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
uh multiple previous roles i always kind

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,799
of lobbied to get a budget to send

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
developers to events like that it's

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,679
really important for them to go

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,960
advocate what they're doing interact

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,400
with their peers

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,840
their developers other developers

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
working from other companies on the same

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,799
project

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,720
and building these relationships uh and

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,080
of course hosting events

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,840
you know most of us don't use their

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,799
offices past six or seven pm you know

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,039
staying there for

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,320
two two hours more to host uh you know

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,080
python meetup or

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,240
you know uh you know whatever kind of

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,039
project meetup is is extremely helpful

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,320
to

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,840
know people to hire people right and

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
uh just kind of building up that

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,520
reputation

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
uh established r d projects university

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,039
i've done that a lot of time

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,000
actually open source is a great uh

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,919
vehicle for these

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,679
collaborations because you know the

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,840
output is open it's less than the

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,799
license that anybody can use

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,760
and it gives you a tap into shaping you

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,840
know kind of the

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,960
next generation talent that you can hire

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,400
from and can

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
you know give you a new perspective on

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
your product and services so we've done

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,720
that a number of times with

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,400
like you know stanford and many other

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,000
kind of top universities and they

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,159
actually came up with some really cool

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,240
things that we never thought of before

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,279
just you know very very positive

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,880
surprise

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,799
um uh update outsourcing um

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
um agreements and i mean this is

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,480
especially important

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
uh you know so you would have a very

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,640
good control on what kind of code

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,159
is coming to you okay in the past most

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,000
of these agreements were you know you're

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,320
getting code that was created by the

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,440
software provider today any kind of

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
delivery you get from a software

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,720
provider might include

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,559
deliveries they got from like 50 other

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,279
open source projects so we need to make

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,000
sure

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,520
that they provide all the notices and

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,880
basically all the disclosure in relation

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,039
to open source and that requires

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,840
updating all these outsourcing agreement

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,279
okay and uh same thing for any m a

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,799
practices and there were a couple of

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,840
presentations earlier

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,080
on uh m a audits uh formalize

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,840
open source cd path we i mentioned you

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,799
know i talked about this briefly

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:12,159
um earlier or going too fast okay

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,679
so um so so these were 17 practices

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,279
of course i'm pretty sure there are more

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,720
if you talk to other uh

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,320
open source practitioners who've been

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,279
doing this for a while they can add a

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,120
lot to this

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,960
um and and i think so we talked on

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,360
you know these are the good things that

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,600
you can adopt really in in how you're

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,400
formalizing open source uh in an

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,320
enterprise

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,919
setting uh the last thing i'm gonna

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,279
mention is challenges there's gonna be a

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,720
lot of challenges and i was

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,039
kind of trying to wrap my hands around

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,880
it and i figured out they would

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,400
most of them fit five different buckets

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,640
so cultural challenges

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,440
and of course you know i have um you

if you're entering and you're aiming to

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,760
build that is you can look back

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,679
at hundreds of companies who've gone

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799
through that before and see how they

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,480
solved it and there are

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,000
um actually at the next foundation we

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
published the book on that

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,039
it's a free ebook that you can download

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
where we talk about each of these

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,279
individually and what is the past to

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,760
help assist you in addressing these

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,440
different challenges
