Description: 
	Join Donovan Brown & Ralph Squillace to learn about Brigade, the Kubernetes-native service that creates structured container pipelines from JavaScript functions, letting you "script" your cluster in reaction to events. You'll also learn about Kashti, the web dashboard that shows you the status of all your Brigade projects.
