Title: Open source and Azure Data | Microsoft European Virtual Open Source Summit
Publication date: 2020-07-29
Playlist: Microsoft Open Source Summit
Description: 
	This keynote from Sunil Kamath explores the #Azure Data mission, how open source fits into the Azure Data team’s efforts, and why there’s never been a better time to work with data. Sunil covers how the Azure Data team is working to help developers and customers—how we’re working with partners and customers to make an impact, especially in this era of COVID-19. Sunil then highlights several recent projects, from healthcare bots across the globe, online learning in Korea, enabling emergency response and essential services to be provided in India, helping financial institutions help small businesses in need—as well as supporting the increase in people working from home and collaborating over Microsoft Teams, due to worldwide quarantine and shelter-in-place orders.   

Sunil also discusses open source efforts in the #AzureData team, including our investment in PostgreSQL committers; acquiring Postgres company Citus Data (Citus is an open source extension that scales out Postgres horizontally); what the Windows telemetry team is doing with Postgres and Citus on Azure; Azure Data Studio; and how Systems Imagination is using Azure SQL Database and Big Data Clusters in the fight against cancer.

Hello. I'm Sunil Kamath, Principal Director Program Management responsible

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,610
for Azure open source databases and also serve on the Azure data leadership team.

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,230
Today I'm extremely proud, and excited, and honored, at the same time to

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,760
deliver this talk on Open Source and Azure Data--now and next. I'm leading with

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,020
a heart because of how important open source is to me and recording this from

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,940
the comfort of my own house. I imagine most of you have your own personal journeys

00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,530
with open source. Let me share a bit of mine. My journey with open source started

00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,839
back in Toronto, Canada in the early 2000s, at IBM as a performance engineer.

00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:45,969
I worked a lot with Linux and databases. If you recall in early 2000 while Linux

00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,929
popularity was growing as a desktop operating system, it was not a great

00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,620
operating system to run databases. There was a lot of work that was needed to

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,999
improve memory management, scheduler algorithms, file i/o management, etc. I

00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:02,019
had a distinct privilege to drive several improvements and optimizations.

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:06,820
Look at the progress on where Linux is today. There's not an app that does not

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,900
run on Linux, and for that matter does not run efficiently at scale. Fast

00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,920
forward to into Microsoft just over three years ago, I helped launch two of

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,180
the most popular open source relational databases in the industry on the Azure

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,610
platform, MySQL and Postgres. MySQL and Postgres were the most sought

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:30,460
after databases from our customers. We listened and delivered. Can you spot me in

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,070
this picture? Gosh, look at how close I'm sitting to my teammates in this picture.

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,340
Seems surreal. Obviously this wouldn't have happened today

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,880
for obvious reasons due to COVID-19. In the same timeframe, in May of 2017 I authored

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,530
this post of preview of Azure Postgres database service. Truly truly

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,000
exciting days. Love my work on open source databases as I'm sure you can see

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,750
it, then and now. Less than one year later, in 2018, here I am being

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,170
interviewed on Microsoft Mechanics, talking about the general availability

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,239
of open source databases on Azure. The same year we also brought Azure Database

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,889
for MariaDB to the platform. Since the availability of these services, it has

00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,680
been extremely popular on Azure. A big big thank you to all those

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,180
who have made the service to what it is today. We couldn't have done this without your

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,030
support and feedback. The great apps and solutions developed using these databases

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,200
led us down the path to do more. The acquisition of Citus Data.

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,480
I was intimately involved in this acquisition of Citus Data into Microsoft.

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,129
For those that are not familiar, Citus is an open-source extension to Postgres

00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:50,769
that transforms single node Postgres and transforms it into a horizontally

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,390
scalable distributed Postgres. Postgres itself, as you all know, is a very

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,099
popular open source relational database. I will talk more about Citus a bit

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,280
later.

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,420
This is obviously not going to be a talk about me,

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,640
my resume, my work, or my team's work. I'm here today representing all of

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,870
Azure Data and my colleagues here within Azure Data who are obsessed about their

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,670
work solving your challenges and delivering solutions on your terms. I'm

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,550
here today to talk about what our team in Azure Data is doing for the

00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,300
open source community. What our Azure Data team is doing for data professionals.

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,440
What are we doing for developers.

00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:42,459
Allow me to talk about our mission. Our mission at Azure Data, delivering the

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,709
one data platform that empowers the world to make sense of all

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:54,390
data anywhere at any scale. We derive our inspiration and purpose from this very

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,239
mission statement to serve you our customers and partners. This mission by

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,650
the way is not possible without open source. Open source is a very key

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,700
ingredient. Within Azure Data, we now have comprehensive open source based data

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,379
products ranging from relational databases to Hadoop, Spark etc. Literally

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:20,919
every product or service we use has some open source technology in it. We

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,600
contribute to open source. We integrate with open source. If you are a developer

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,849
or an architect that primarily prefers to use open source, you have

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:35,440
all these capabilities and this rich ecosystem seamlessly integrated within

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,210
Azure. There has never been a more empowering time to work with data.

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:49,080
Whether you are a data scientist, or a developer, or a manager, a marketeer, or

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,060
anyone making decisions based on data, because due to COVID-19 things are

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:02,260
different. I want to share a few examples of how my team at Azure Data, alongside

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,380
our partners is helping to make an impact. First example, this is a

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,919
super interesting story, and recently published. Microsoft Healthcare Bot. You

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,210
can find a URL on this slide to make it easy for you to look things

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,909
up later. This article is about how healthcare bots are being used to fight

00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:30,460
the good fight against COVID. This healthcare bot helps to screen people

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,919
for possible coronavirus infections and treatments. Used in 23 countries and

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,990
also in European countries like Denmark, Italy, Finland. From the

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:48,169
beginning of March 2020 to the middle of May, this has served over 320 million

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:56,270
messages, helped over 31 million individuals, built on top of Azure. Specifically the

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,979
Azure Redis Cache, Azure CosmosDB, our flagship NoSQL database,

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:07,190
Azure Search etc. The critical sector impacted due to

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,000
COVID related stay-at-home order has been education, with many many schools

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,770
and universities across the world being shut down. I've been deeply touched

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,419
and impressed by how local governments and private institutions have stepped up

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,700
to this challenge. As an example, in Asia live lecture wasn't working, and students

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,980
were not able to access lectures. They needed to make home based learning work.

00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,750
In just a few weeks, we enabled the solution that serves over 4 million

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,640
students on Azure and using the MySQL service, from inception to production.

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,860
This example is just the beginning. If this was a previous generation of data

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,160
center architecture or software architecture I don't think we would have

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,220
been able to deal with this crisis as effectively as we have been able to. We

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,520
have also been working very closely with partners to support local government

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,690
initiatives. Our Azure database services are an integral part of the solution to

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,690
respond to COVID-19 enabling emergency response services. Things like

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,900
coordinating donations of essential supplies. We also made it possible for

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,919
volunteers to register to offer their services, so that doctors, nurses,

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:25,810
paramedics, & IT professionals could register to help people who needed help.

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,770
Azure Database Services are also part of an effort here in Europe as governments

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,550
approved funding loans aimed at financing working capital for small

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,710
businesses, and especially those in sectors which are significantly impacted

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,880
due to COVID. One of the banks found that application requirement to scale to

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,920
2 million connections. The inherent scale available in our data services, in

00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,930
this case MySQL, helped to support this increased mode with full security,

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,930
and most importantly cost-effectively. There is this working from home

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,170
thing. Which I suspect has touched many of you, especially those of us who work in

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,750
software, where the nature of our jobs allows us to do do it from home. We are

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,390
pretty lucky that way. Although I have to say, I know that working from home is a

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:24,600
privilege, but I also have two small kids at home, and I know firsthand it's not

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,850
that easy. My admiration and empathy for all of you out there who are doing your

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:36,419
best to meet everybody's demand, be it kids, family, work time, teammates under

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,550
these testing times. Another example of how things are different. At Microsoft

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,380
we've seen a huge spike in the usage of Microsoft Teams. As of mid-May we have

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,190
over 75 million daily active users, for 4 billion meeting minutes per day.

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:58,740
Privilege, truly a privilege, to help people around the world to enable to

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,830
work remotely in a more secure way, staying connected through video meetings,

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:12,410
calls, chats, etc. I spend a good part of my days in meetings conference calls,

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,820
collaborating with my team. For those who have internet bandwidth, it helps to

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,860
see people, not just to hear their voice, but to actually see their expressions,

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,260
their reactions, to stay connected. It's a privilege to be able to do what I do and

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm hugely grateful for that. I should point out that Microsoft Teams runs on

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,690
Azure. Teams is a fully cloud native application. The fact

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,010
that Teams is able to handle this volume in these testing times, is a

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,980
testament for what Azure and cloud can provide to these critical applications.

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,530
We are building all of this, Azure's cloud infrastructure in a very sustainable way.

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:03,720
Now back to the heart I started this talk with. At Microsoft, we love open

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,760
source. You could say perhaps more correctly that we have grown to love

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,910
open source. My team well, we live, eat, breathe, open source--

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,810
making our open source cloud databases easy to provision, more accessible, more

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,730
secure, easy to deploy in the cloud.

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,060
Which takes me to the quote from Satya, our CEO. There's something about this

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,280
quote from Satya that I find really compelling. It drives home that Microsoft

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,370
today is not the company we were 10 years ago.

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,850
Satya says "Judge us by the actions we have taken in the recent past, our actions

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:54,830
today, and in the future." The fact is that companies and culture and people can

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,630
change. I feel blessed to be part of this change at Microsoft.

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,860
Today at this European Open Source Summit, I believe 3 of my teammates are going

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,920
to be giving a talk, John Gossman, Jose Miguel Parrella, and Toni Willberg, on the state

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,060
of Linux on Azure. There is so much going on with Linux and open source and

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,320
Microsoft Azure. This is just one example of our commitment to open source and

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,820
there are much much more. I mentioned the Citus Data acquisition

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,440
earlier. I was involved in that acquisition on the very beginning, getting to know

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,870
the team, the founders, and their wholehearted commitment to the Postgres

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,700
open source community. Citus is an extension to Postgres that I

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,600
talked about before. It transforms Postgres into a horizontally scalable

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,320
distributed database. Which means it's possible to do things that simply were

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,430
not possible before. Citus is open source as I just talked about, and I'm

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,380
very happy to say also available as a built-in, cloud native, fully integrated

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,550
deployment option for our Postgres database offering on Azure. It is

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:12,000
Postgres Hyperscale. I put a short URL on the screen to the GitHub repo for the

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,110
Citus open source project in case any of you want to try it out or learn more.

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,519
I talked about how scaling out Postgres with Citus opens the door to new

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,040
possibilities. I love this quote from our own internal user who uses Postgres

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,529
and Citus running on Azure to power an analytical dashboard. It is used by

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,140
the Windows Data and Intelligence team, captures over 20,000 different types of

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,070
metrics, from over 800 million devices, supporting hundreds of concurrent users,

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,850
over 6 million queries executed every day. It's a huge deployment, making it

00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:01,320
possible to make shiproom decisions for Windows. I put a short URL to this blog

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,470
post that dives into much detail about this workload, the use case,

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,000
and their implementation details, in case any of you want to read and learn

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,550
more about this story. I don't want you to think we just build great

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,960
capabilities on top of open source and use open source only for our own benefit.

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,230
We believe it's super important to contribute back to open source

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:33,010
communities in very meaningful ways. Which leads to just a few months ago, we

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,040
welcomed three Postgres committers to our Postgres team at Microsoft.

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,390
Committers in Postgres are engineers who have made substantial contributions to

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,130
Postgres, and who lead key areas of ongoing Postgres development and

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,900
innovation. That's what Thomas Munro, Jeff Davis, and Andres Freund are

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,880
continuing to do, collaborating and partnering with developers around the

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,760
world from multitude of other companies to shape the future of Postgres.

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,100
In fact, since this blog was initially published, a new Postgres committer has

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,600
joined Microsoft. So we went ahead and photoshopped David Rowley into this

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,100
picture since obviously his work is also very important, and I didn't want to

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,330
leave him out of the story. Our open source contribution also

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,640
expands into other areas, such as Azure Data Studio as an example, which is a

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,070
multi database cross-platform tool that is very popular, supports SQL Server

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,060
and Postgres today, and plans to expand to support other databases as

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,490
well. One more example to share. This picture is from a video filmed in

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,650
Florida in November of 2019 as part of our Microsoft Ignite event.

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,820
David Schneider is the Vice President of Engineering at Systems Imagination. He

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,330
got up on the stage to demo what his company is doing with SQL database

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,430
and Big Data Clusters on Azure in their fight against cancer, in their effort to

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,350
analyze what is called synthetic lethality. SQL Server, Big Data

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,440
Clusters allow you to deploy scalable clusters of SQL Server Spark HDFS

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,740
containers running on Kubernetes. These components are running

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,200
side-by-side to enable you to read, write, process big data from either T-SQL or

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,040
Spark, allowing you to easily combine and analyze your high value

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,350
relational data with high volume big data. The team at Systems Imagination use

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,120
Spark, SQL database, Azure Data Studio, Big Data Clusters, amongst others, in

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,320
a way that was dramatically faster and less expensive than doing it on premises.

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:47,449
I haven't talked much about products today. Strange for me, I'm a product guy. I

00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:52,670
do want to mention that earlier in May Microsoft Build, our annual developer

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,940
event, went online too, all digital for 48 hours with tons and tons of content for

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,889
all of you now to consume. Go to mybuild.microsoft.com and click on the

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,120
watch on demand sessions button. You can learn more about a ton of new

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,310
capabilities we announced which are all Azure Data related at this event. Of

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,540
course, some of those will be also covered as part of this Open Source

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,050
Summit. Now it's time to wrap up this keynote, and let you move on to what's

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,899
next. I hope that all of you and your families first of all stay safe and

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:38,240
healthy. I also hope that you can find the silver lining in this mess this

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:47,660
chaos that is COVID. Know that our team in Azure Data is working extremely hard to

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:54,110
support all of our users, customers, and partners, and we're committed to contributing

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,720
and keep giving back to open source communities wherever we can. Also

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,610
importantly know that we'd love your feedback. We have this thing called User

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:09,650
Voice. For most Azure services you can search and get to User

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:15,350
Voice page for the service. Feedback is a gift. We value it. We treasure it. We

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,339
thank you for it. Speaking of thank-yous. Big thank you to

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,380
all of the speakers who have worked tirelessly hard in order to bring all of

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,030
this useful content available to you today. Our gratitude to all the teams

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,380
participating in this event, and a huge shout out to the organizers who made all

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,000
of these things happen. Thanks to all of you for

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,420
