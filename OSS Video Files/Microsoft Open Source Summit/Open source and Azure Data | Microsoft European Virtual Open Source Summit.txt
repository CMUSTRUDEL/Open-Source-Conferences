Publication date: 2020-07-29
Playlist: Microsoft Open Source Summit
Description: 
	This keynote from Sunil Kamath explores the #Azure Data mission, how open source fits into the Azure Data team’s efforts, and why there’s never been a better time to work with data. Sunil covers how the Azure Data team is working to help developers and customers—how we’re working with partners and customers to make an impact, especially in this era of COVID-19. Sunil then highlights several recent projects, from healthcare bots across the globe, online learning in Korea, enabling emergency response and essential services to be provided in India, helping financial institutions help small businesses in need—as well as supporting the increase in people working from home and collaborating over Microsoft Teams, due to worldwide quarantine and shelter-in-place orders.   

Sunil also discusses open source efforts in the #AzureData team, including our investment in PostgreSQL committers; acquiring Postgres company Citus Data (Citus is an open source extension that scales out Postgres horizontally); what the Windows telemetry team is doing with Postgres and Citus on Azure; Azure Data Studio; and how Systems Imagination is using Azure SQL Database and Big Data Clusters in the fight against cancer.
