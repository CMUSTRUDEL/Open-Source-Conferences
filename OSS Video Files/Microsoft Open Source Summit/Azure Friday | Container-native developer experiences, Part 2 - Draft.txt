Title: Azure Friday | Container-native developer experiences, Part 2 - Draft
Publication date: 2018-02-09
Playlist: Microsoft Open Source Summit
Description: 
	Join Donovan Brown & Ralph Squillace to learn how to use Draft to kick start container-native development for Kubernetes applications. Draft lets you concentrate on your service code by removing the containment and service composition from most development work, which increases the speed of service development and improves the consistency of Dockerfiles & Helm charts.
