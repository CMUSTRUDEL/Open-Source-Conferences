yay

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,720
and i hope you can all hear me if you

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
can't hear me

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
i don't know what people should do they

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,160
should probably comment on discord or

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,880
on youtube but uh but i think we'll

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,959
figure it out in the meantime

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,040
can you hear me or not i love it we're

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
having a very professional setup in my

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,240
living room these are my all of my

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
plants but not all of my plants like a

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,880
real small subsection of all of my

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,519
plants

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,800
uh and we've set up using all kinds of

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
like things that you have around the

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
house

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,120
i will share some pictures on twitter

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
later on so that you can see

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
uh what the situation is like uh right

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,160
now right here

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,720
um so welcome to rosconf first virtual

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,839
roscomp we've done the rosconf before

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,959
the first one was in vienna in 2015

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,399
and then later that year in berlin

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,399
and then we did one in 2018 in amsterdam

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,800
and now you're here with me in my living

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,279
room uh in your living room maybe or in

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,519
your

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,480
workstation or wherever you are and i'm

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
so happy that you

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,199
were able to join us so rosconf actually

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
started when i was going to conferences

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,480
and i would hear

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,399
a talk by a maintainer and i would get

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,079
really excited about the project

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,920
but then you're at a conference and

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,959
conference wi-fi is typically like

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
really really bad

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,160
so by the time that i had actually

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
cloned the repository

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,360
probably we were already well into the

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
next talk

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,959
and i would probably forget about it or

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
think oh i'll check it out on the

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,040
weekend then

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,600
and you sort of never do even though you

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,639
were really

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,279
intending to contribute to this project

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
and so we figured out a way to create a

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,240
conference where

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
we would invite a couple of maintainers

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
and those maintainers would pitch their

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
project

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
and would uh would share with the

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,480
audience what kind of contributions

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,079
they're specifically looking for

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,920
and then the rest of the day was just

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
going to be reserved for contributing to

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,160
that project

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
together with the maintainer to pair

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,079
with the maintainer or maintainers

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,000
or core contributors team

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,839
and that worked really well the times

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
that we've we've done that

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
we made sure that the groups that could

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
actually contribute to a project were

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
were pretty small so that the

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
maintainers wouldn't be overwhelmed with

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,560
the amount of people trying to

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,959
create issues and create pull requests

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,800
and a lot of the people that would

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,519
contribute during roscon would

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
end up becoming longer-term contributors

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,920
as well

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,240
uh just because they got a taste of what

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
the prep the project is really about

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
they had that connection with the

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,800
maintainer and they had a feel for the

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,480
vision

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,560
of the maintainer and we're hoping that

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,160
maybe through this virtual format

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
because that's unfortunately the state

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,880
of the world that we're in right now

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
we can replicate a similar thing um so

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
before we get started i have my shopping

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
list here of things that i should

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,000
definitely mention

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,040
um when uh i want to call out we have a

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,519
code of conduct

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
and you can find it on the website

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,360
and then we also with

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,960

there's people in the audience you

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,799
watching right now

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,440
that want to pitch their own project to

describe your project we do have a

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,919
couple of requirements though

if you want your projects to participate

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,440
you need to have a code of conduct for

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
your repository and also contributing

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
guidelines

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,080
contributing guidelines should line up

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,880
how you

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,440
how you'd like to receive contributions

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
uh

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,160
if you have any naming conventions maybe

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,440
for your branches or for pull requests

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,080
or if you can point to any particular

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
issues

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,640
uh or or like topics or segments of your

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
repo that people can contribute to

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,960
so um if you're so maybe you have

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,320
labeled some issues

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,960
as uh first contribution friendly or

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,440
help wanted or anything like that so if

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
you want

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,960
picture projects you need to go through

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,000
that channel the general channel on

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,240
discord

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
and and see if you can find some people

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,640
that want to work on your projects

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,080
if they do we will create a separate

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
discord channel for you so you can

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
discuss

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,000
uh work on your project in that channel

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,240
um is there anything else i wanted to

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,679
say well maybe this is a moment for

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,360
breather because as far as i know the

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,840
room together video can start

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,240
yay so let's try that ruby together

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,200
video once more uh and then i'll see you

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,520
after hi roscott i'm andre arco better

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,039
known as indirect on the internet things

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
i've been on the bundler team for 10

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,320
years and i founded ruby together to

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,240
make sure that rubygems.org

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,000
bundler and other ruby open source

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,120
infrastructure that everyone depends on

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
stays maintained

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,120
and operational since 2015 when ruby

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,840
together started

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,320
we've accomplished a lot 99.9 uptime for

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,039
rubygems.org

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,280
zero major outages shipped bundler

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,480
inside ruby itself via collaboration

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
with ruby core

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,240
we've released several major versions 24

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,799
minor versions and 167 bug fix releases

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
of rubygems and bundler we've also

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
merged bundler and rubygems together

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,919
into a single repository and github

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,440
organization and we're continuing to

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,440
make them work better together

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,799
over time we also launched

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,200
stats.rubygems.org to show the community

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,240
who is using rubygems what versions of

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,080
ruby they're using

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,679
what ci systems they're using what

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,760
versions of ruby gems they're using and

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,360
what platforms they're running on

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,360
we've also funded development work on

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,880
other ruby open source projects like

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,080
the ruby toolbox gemstash simple cub

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,919
bridge troll finally we've created a

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
program to pay experienced developers

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
and developers who are just getting

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,520
started

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,480
to practice pairing and open source

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,480
development together called ruby me

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,320
all of our work is 100 funded by

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,000
individual developers like you

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
and companies that depend on ruby for

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,520
their business

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,559
more funding means that we pay more open

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
source developers

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,720
fund more ruby open source projects and

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,200
run more rounds of ruby me

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
with more participants join ruby

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,559
together as a member today

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
and help us improve the ruby ecosystem

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,320
and community for everyone

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:27,840
our website is rubytogether.org

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,840
i have a pleasure from the austin after

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and we're back is my sound back as well

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
that would be good

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,039
um so so thank you so much and you

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,799
should definitely

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,080
check out the the project and see what

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,360
ways you can contribute

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
i believe they also have a merch option

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,080
so i will

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
tweet that out later from the rosconf

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,960
account because i saw some

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,720
some pretty sweet swag in there uh that

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,919
uh well i mean the holidays are coming

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,919
up so maybe that's something that you

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
can buy for your loved ones

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,200
and support a good project in the

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,039
meantime right

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
and i think this is a time where we'll

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
go through the

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
through different projects uh we're

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
seeing if we can can maybe switch up

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,559
some of the order

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,400
uh we'll hear this i see nodding so that

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,400
might be that might be the thing

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
um so we'll go through the four projects

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
that we have lined up for today

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,200
uh which is ruby formatter so we're

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
still going to play the video and

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,400
hopefully that's something for you

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,120
uh then there is the faraday project

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
then there's the skunk project um and

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,400
there's a gem stash project which is one

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
of the projects actually that movie

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,559
together supports

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,440
um so big shout out to them again um

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,039
and when we're ready maybe we can have

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,159
the maintainer from faraday

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:44,080
on or do we want to oh

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,240
he's oh my gosh hola you're there

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,600
that's wonderful do you want to do you

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,120
want to get started with your

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,880
with your pitch and we'll give you a

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,919
little bit of time extra

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,640
because we have a little bit of time for

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,679
you so take it away

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,640
thank you hello thank you internet um

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:07,760
hope you can hear me my name is ola

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,039
i work with matt matia

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
on being a maintainer for faraday

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,080
faraday is a http client

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,080
what's that it's a way to talk http

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
i made some notes here i'm going to try

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,200
to stick to them

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,799
so that this is short and sweet and we

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,640
will get to what we want to do today

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:31,360
faraday is a generic way to talk http

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,760
you can swap back ends as your needs

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
change when changing back-end

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,320
no other app code that you wrote needs

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,120
to change

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,120
this is useful

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,159
faraday is flexible plugable etc

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,520
it's a series of pipeline steps that

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,679
ultimately return an answer response to

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
you

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,919
that's super but

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,000
we ship built-in middleware and adapters

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,200
and we even have a collection of

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
built-ins if you will

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,159
and this leads to people mostly using

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:19,279
the built-ins

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,279
or perhaps write one of their own

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,720
whereas there already exists a wealth of

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,039
faraday software

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,159
out there great software

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,440
we want to promote that wealth by

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,080
demoting

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,080
the built-ins to regular status

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:47,679
so i've made a

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,679
short hit list here like

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,840
if we can make like an awesome faraday

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,960
document which is like go here and pick

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,279
what you want

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,720
for your http needs you would be able to

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,200
well select something and it could be

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,320
a lot better than what now currently

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,240
ships

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:17,279
like stock built in with faraday

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:21,200
so a gemification for today

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:24,400
um faraday is just turned 10

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,760
and it's relied on by everyone

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,799
a lot of people so you'll be helping

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,240
many people at the same time

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,799
well i hope to see you later on this

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,960
thing

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,600
and a sort of technical

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,960
introduction will be the start of our

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,840
session together

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,840
when we get there hope to see you

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,520
thanks

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,560
again thank you

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
and now we have some feedback

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:07,760
[Music]

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:09,279
give me a second no

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
because you know my screen reader was

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,919
open as well and then sometimes you have

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,400
an issue where

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,200
you have a little bit of feedback uh but

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,120
anyway

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
that's that's quick to be fixed uh even

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,320
on a windows machine

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,399
even though arnold was bitching about

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,799
this a little bit before

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,080
uh but we'll figure everything out and

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,480
thank you so much ola for

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,240
for your uh project presentation you'll

project um so people can hang out with

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,720

um and it's about the ruby formatter uh

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,559
project

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,399
which she pointed out and made a point

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,679
of pointing out actually

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:13,039
is kind of like ruby like robocop but

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,720
not robocop so there's that um and also

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,279

if you'd like and i will share the link

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,320
to the videos

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
for nuruko and actually you're at the

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360
same top level

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,360
youtube channel so you can probably just

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,080
find them in all of the videos for this

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,399
channel

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,600
um uh where she also talks about movie

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,200
formatted projects so if

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,799
if you're like you're watching the pitch

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,679
and you're like i wish i had more

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,039
information

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,200
there's even more information in that

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,720
video as well um so

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,960
let's roll penelope's video hi everyone

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,159
i'm so happy to be able to introduce you

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,559
all to ruby format

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,279
today for rossconf and i really do hope

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,799
you will

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,240
contribute to the project um i have sent

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,799
a pre-recorded video

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,840
uh because this started a little early

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,720
for my time zone

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,720
in new york so i do hope uh that you

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,799
don't mind and i will be online for the

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
in-person ama

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,120
so to introduce myself my name is

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,880
penelope pheppin i go by penelope zone

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,039
almost everywhere on the internet

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,360
i use she her pronouns and i identify as

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,159
a trans woman

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,120
so what is ruby format like why am i

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,200
here today what

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,720
is this project and like the simplest

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,440
possible answer to this is that ruby

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,880
format is a ruby auto formatter

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,360
it's a program that's designed to

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,360
consume files of ruby source code

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,720
apply various transformations to them

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,440
and then spit out

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,960
functionally identical ruby files just

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,960
with cleaned up formatting

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
the idea being that ruby ends up with a

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,480
single consistent style

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
and this is best explained by looking at

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,559
ruby format working inside a text editor

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,240
as you can see here i'm sort of just

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,240
writing my code doing whatever

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,440
throwing code wherever i want and then

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,159
when i save the file

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
the code just snaps into place almost as

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,720
if

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,480
by magic and this is really what ruby

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,159
format is designed to do it's designed

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
to sit in your text editor and just

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,279
automatically format your code as you're

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,279
working

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,440
there's a great opportunity for y'all to

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,000
help me with ruby format today

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,039
so what would that look like well ruby

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
format has two

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,200
really big classes of bug that it takes

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,120
a lot of work to identify

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,279
and so i'm primarily here today to ask

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,600
folks to help me identify bugs

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,159
not really burn down and fix them but

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,919
just find as many bugs as we can

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,320
and to do that there are primarily two

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,520
types of bug i'm really looking for

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,159
for folks to help me find uh the first

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
is um the kind of error message that

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
happens

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,960
when ruby format encounters a program it

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,039
doesn't understand

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,960
what this error message basically means

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,919
is that you provided ruby format with

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,520
some code that it's not seen before

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,520
and because it hasn't seen this code

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,559
before it doesn't know how to format the

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,240
source code

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,240
and this is really bad for us we don't

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
want to crash on any ruby files in

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
existence

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,120
and so the first thing i'd really love

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,919
is when you run ruby format on your own

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,320
project

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,919
um see if this class of bug falls out

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,880
the other side and if it does

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,760
file a bug report um so that's sort of

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,760
class one

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,760
and then class two is the case where

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,360
ruby format meaningfully changes the

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,159
behavior of your file

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,960
and causes your tests to fail basically

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,519
i'd love to know

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,000
if you run ruby format on your project

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,880
do any tests start failing because if

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
they do

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,240
that's a bug in ruby format itself and

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,480
it needs to be fixed

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
why does this happen usually it's

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,960
because i haven't accounted for some

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,120
kind of edge case

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,159
in formatting a particularly weird

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
construct but

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,559
ruby format isn't really being used as a

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,559
daily driver on any real ruby projects

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,559
today and so i'd love to know

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,960
if you encounter any edge cases with it

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,120
while running it on your own code bases

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,000
so that's kind of the help i'm looking

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,799
for

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,600
in terms of exactly what i'd love to see

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,640
though

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,559
um ruby format today like if you file a

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,080
bug and it's a huge file

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,760
it's really really hard for me to work

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,080
out exactly what's going on

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,159
so i'd really love it if not only you

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,600
could identify which files it's failing

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,279
on in your applications

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,760
but also bring them down to minimal

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,840
examples so that we can understand like

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,000
what small fragment of code actually

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,519
caused ruby format to fail

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,279
um there are bonus points for making

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,440
rust contributions and actually fixing

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,919
bugs but you don't need to know rust

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,240
to help with ruby format just finding

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,600
bugs by running it on your ruby project

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,519
and then bringing the code to the

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,399
smallest possible size to reproduce the

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,360
bug

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,960
would be really really helpful so let's

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,360
talk about how you actually do this how

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,559
do you get started with ruby format

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
well the first thing you're going to

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,559
need to do is install rust because ruby

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,200
format is actually primarily a rust

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,960
project

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,880
with ruby inside it and not the other

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,039
way around so if you just go to

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,720
rustup.rs and follow the instructions

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,080
that will tell you

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,159
everything you need to do to install

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,080
rust once you've done that

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,320
uh you can actually clone ruby format

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,080
down and run make all

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,440
make all will actually initialize the

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,200
ruby format build

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
um this is gonna compile a ton of rust

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
dependencies and it turns out that like

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,559
first time compilation of rust code is

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,960
very very slow

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,559
all future compilations of ruby format

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,480
will be fast because

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,919
then the build will be cached but this

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
very first time it's going to be slow

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,000
and you're going to want to grab some

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
coffee

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
after that you're free to run ruby

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,159
format on your project and then start

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,399
the

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,320
reporting the classes of bugs i

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,760
mentioned previously

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,080
um so that's how i'd like to get help um

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,240
and yeah i think that's basically

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,559
everything we need yeah report crashes

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,039
or test failures as you encounter them

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,039
and thank you so much for listening

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,080
and thank you so much penelope so again

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,640
penelope is unfortunately not uh

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,279
not present in our discord channel today

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,399
or not

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,120
not available for the ask me anything a

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,760
bit

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,679
but you can still totally uh start

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,919
contributing to that project

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,200
there is contributing guidelines and so

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,599
you can just figure out

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,040
you can just add a issue to the issue

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,639
tracker in the

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,399
reformatter project and let

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,919
penelope also know in the discord

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,919
channel what kind of

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,960
issues or what kind of bits you would

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,520
like to work on

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,960
for the before mother project and she

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,639
will make sure to reach out to you

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
as soon as she's feeling better but

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,760
she's hoping that you would still

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,440
consider her project

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,919
that way um and we have the next project

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,720
pitch

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,720
coming up yes there's some heavy nodding

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,200
in this room

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,720
by ernesto to talk about the skunk

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,879
project so let's roll them

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,240
hey my name is ernesto and i'm here to

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,359
talk about skunk

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,079
the skunk score calculator this really

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,640
cool tool

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,200
that you can use to measure technical

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,240
debt

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,040
in any of your ruby projects

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,520
a few things about me i am originally

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,960
from

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,200
argentina but i live in philadelphia

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
and i love open source when i'm not

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,599
working on open source

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,520
i am the founder and a software engineer

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,240
at fast ruby dot io we have a policy to

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,800
do

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,800
everything open source by default now

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,920
the inspiration for this project

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,440
came out of our experience working on a

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,800
lot of ruby on rails

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,440
upgrade projects it usually goes

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,880
like this client comes up to us and

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,920
they're like yeah this is a great

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,839
project

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,079
and it would be awesome if you can

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,040
maintain it from now on

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,839
and sometimes we've agreed and we found

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,960
ourselves

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,839
in this situation so the idea was

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,599
how can we quickly assess tech debt in a

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,800
ruby project

00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,640
and that's how scum skunk uh

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,200
was born as a tool to do this for us

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,800
and it uses a bunch of open source gems

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,079
to do this

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,880
it uses simple cov for code coverage

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,720
uses ruby critic for code quality and

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,280
complexity

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,040
and this gives us an idea of what the

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,960
maintainability of the project

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,839
really is now we have a signal for code

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,400
coverage

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,359
and we have a signal for complexity for

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,960
every single

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:32,880
file in the code base and they're

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,280
both analyzing the same code base

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,560
so we thought what if we could combine

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,839
these two metrics

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,240
into one the skunk score and the main

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,240
question we want to answer is this one

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,160
we want to find the most complex files

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,480
that have little to no

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,280
tests and then we can make a decision

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,520
about what to do

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,200
so now we have the skunk score thanks to

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,160
skunk

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,920
and now we know where we are in terms of

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,079
the technical debt

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,119
map so a few things about the features

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,720
that we support

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,040
right now there's a skunk score table

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,480
that helps you find the modules that are

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,760
more complex

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,400
and have little to no tests so you can

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,520
decide to refactor some of these files

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,760
the ones that are super complex

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,280
another thing that you can do is find

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,000
files that are complex

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,440
and have zero percent code coverage and

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,440
maybe write tests for them

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,839
it also shows you the skunk score

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,079
average which is super interesting if

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,760
you

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,640
track it over time another thing that

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,520
you can do

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,800
is compare a feature branch with your

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,920
main branch

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,720
and then know whether you are

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,640
increasing technical debt or decreasing

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,440
it

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,359
and one more thing you can do is run it

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,680
as a github action

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,119
now this is a gem that is available and

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,560
you can use it in

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,880
any projects if you just gem install it

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,320
anywhere so that's why we can do a

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,680
github action pretty easily

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,839
now today and for the next

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
few days and weeks and months what i

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,000
want to work on

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,560
are these features and i would love your

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,400
help with this

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,800
one thing that i think is super

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,320
important is to keep track of the skunk

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,040
score average

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,040
over time

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,200
so we want to see that number go down

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,440
because that means that we're paying off

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
technical debt

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,560
another thing that would be great is to

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,280
have a github page

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,800
to show some examples from the real

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,920
world from

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,040
open source projects that are used by

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,440
hundreds of people another thing that

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,240
would be

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,920
cool would be if we can share the skunk

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,119
score data

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,880
by just adding an environment variable

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,599
before calling skunk another thing that

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,119
doesn't work right now is when you

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,599
compare two branches

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,200
it would be awesome if it also took into

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,400
account the code coverage

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,960
changes to tell you

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
how much better the skunk score average

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,880
really is

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,800
all right cool so if you're interested

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,240
in this project and you want to know

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,040
more about this

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,800
find me in the discord channel and ask

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,079
me any questions

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,160
or just go to the repository in github

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,640
and find all the issues over there

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,000
if you end up making a contribution

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,800
that's awesome

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,280
i i'm super grateful and i'd be happy to

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,160
send

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,160
over uh mail over a set of

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,119
so i think what ernesto was trying to

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,520
say that

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,480
is that they have goodies to send uh for

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,560
the people that

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,560
contribute to the skunk project um there

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,520
was a little bit of the video that was

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,280
not working anymore

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
doesn't matter we'll figure out what it

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,880
what exactly uh the

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,880
the rules for engagements are for the

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,079
for the swag and we'll let you know

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,040
in the uh in the discord channel uh for

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,000
the skype project

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,760
by the way uh yeah off cam voice yeah

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,960
who's this adam's talking hello this is

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,040
arnold

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,040
um can you move a bit then

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,800
because we're barely wearing face masks

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
that's it so the thing is the video

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
didn't work but it's clearly

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,319
on me it's not on anyone it's okay i

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,680
wanted to you know i want to give you a

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:40,079
break and be like oh

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:43,200
oh video quality and stuff and

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,960
but you can blame it on me oh sorry next

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,640
time i will explain it on our note it's

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,160
much easier anyway we'll get you the

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,880
details for how to

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
be eligible for that skunk sweet sweet

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,440
skunk that's weird

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,599
sway um in the discord channel

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,960
yeah in the general channel um and while

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,839
we're talking about weird stuff

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,640
uh we so the code of conduct team is

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,920
very active

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,119
uh i might or might not have made a

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,800
little mistake in

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,440
my uh and seeing just a little before

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
it's noted and i'll promise to do better

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,839
from now on

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,839
but it's good to know that our photo

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,800
contact team is very active

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,000
and so if you notice anything that i say

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,040
and i'm sorry

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
or anyone else says or does uh on

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,839
our channel so on discord or on uh

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
youtube live in the live chat

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,040
or maybe on twitter using our hashtag or

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,319
our twitter handle then please let us

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,800
know and we'll

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,079
we'll help you out there so that's good

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,440
to know

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,400
um it's working it's been tested um so

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,800
fresh tested maybe even um anyway so

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,480
after

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,400
this uh introduction into the skunk

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,920
project you can join ernesto of course

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
in the discord channel for discount

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,359
project

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,359
uh and get working on skunk uh once

00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,079
we're done with all of the project

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,920
pitches um and once again i want to tell

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,440
you that you're able to pitch your own

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,960
project as well

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,560
so if you want to fit your own project

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,400
and want to find contributors in the

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,720
participant of rosecon

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,800
using a picture project in the discord

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,680
channel the general channel

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,160
and once you have more than one or like

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,800
one

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,839
plus maybe a person that wants to work

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,760
on your project

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,040
let us know and we create a special

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,160
discord channel just

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,040
for you um so you can get cracking right

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,920
away

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,640
um all right and maybe also fun to know

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,040
before

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,240
uh we go to our last project

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,720
presentation

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,760
um is that what arno and i will actually

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,000
be working on

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,680
uh right uh because we were we were

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
thinking do we want to join one of the

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,000
projects

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,000
no actually we have a much bigger bigger

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,599
project on our hands

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,240
uh as is um so the ross home io website

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,040
is very old i mean very old in internet

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,560
terms right

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,119
uh it started in 2015 uh it's

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,000
based on the middleman uh project uh

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,680
library

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,680
and uh it has seen many maintainers and

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,119
people working on this project

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,119
uh since the years and so it's not

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,760
working as well as we might want it to

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,079
work

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,400
uh i mean everybody brought their own

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,880
sort of dependencies to it and their

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,480
their own sort of workarounds to it and

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,640
we really want to spend today

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,000
uh cleaning up that website and making

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,800
sure that it's uh

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,640
you know it should be much easier to get

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,359
started next time that we want to host a

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,119
roscomm

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,599
and let's hope that that next crossbone

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,520
would be impressive as well again

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,720
we've debated a little and i was just

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,800
like why don't we just

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,480
use jekyll it's a it's a ruby project

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,160
right that just makes sense

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,760
and arnold wants to use

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,359
xgs next he is yes clearly because

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,480
look justify yourself i might be a bit

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,319
outdated here but um so the thing is um

00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,920
i love ruby primarily because it's

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,079
fantastic backhand language

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,119
and i think a website without a backhand

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,720
uh maybe doesn't need ruby if only say

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,680
you don't have to de-install

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,599
outdated libraries but i had so much fun

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,280
getting rid of power over the last

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,960
months if you thought why is that

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,240
website so slow that has to do with me

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,200
learning how the internet works five

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,200
years ago

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,319
um anyway so i thought let's do

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,920
something new that i've

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,680
never done before because that's a good

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,599
idea for a hack day so

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,960
that's why i thought yeah it's a

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,359
front-end language for uh

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,720
for uh for a front-end project so uh

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,240
yeah next.js

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,560
if you want to do something uh silly um

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,160
you can join us but i think i'll just be

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,000
pulling out my own hairs and

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,359
during the day uh but if you want to

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,400
help with that uh

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:49,359
come join us for next year opinions

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,440
let us know in youtube comments it's

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,079
it's a javascript library we will have

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,880
plenty of opinions we have many opinions

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,359
anyway so

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,920
that's what we will be doing uh just to

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,560
uh

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,200
have make sure we can well have a

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
roscommon

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,960
every quarter maybe and because we can

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,680
just why why are you saying this on

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,640
camera

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,079
or no because usually you say those

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,440
things and i know that you were going to

00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,280
say it so i just thought

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,960
thank you flora i have this one so we

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,800
can do this every quarter and it's not

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,200
going to be a hassle to set it up like

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,599
a month of work to get a site up in the

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,119
air but just faster because that's what

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,720
javascript frameworks always promise

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,760
right

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,359
yeah absolutely so um also i think maybe

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,400
some of the trouble that we have with

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,079
the website

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,400
has to do with me uh not following like

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,359
if i contribute to a project i'm usually

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,599
very diligent

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,640
and i make sure to create an issue first

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,680
and i create a good

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,040
full request and i really describe my

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,000
my changes meticulously sure except

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,440
for for when it's one of the projects

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,319
that we work on with the ruby and l

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
foundation

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,920
uh so be it the meetup that we organized

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,359
amsterdam ruby meetup

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,119
uh if you if you're not part of the

00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,839
amsterdam ruby meetup yet you should

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,160
totally

00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,560
sign up i mean it's it's really not

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,240
amsterdam anymore it's it's an online

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,599
or it's an online meetup anyway so you

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,839
can can always join

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,520
uh from the comfort of your living room

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,240
um as we do today

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,800
um but uh but i'm sorry i'm not that

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,960
great

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,119
at creating really good full requests

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,480
for my own projects and so usually i

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,240
just push to maine

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,560
and maybe some of the trouble that we

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,119
had with the project comes from that

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,720
maybe not who knows um so that's the

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,040
project that we'll be working on

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,760
um we are waiting for one more

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,200
maintainer

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,400
to uh to broadcast the last uh project

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,599

yes still not arrived um so

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,520
in order to buy some time what we could

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,960
do is do we want to already show the

sure let's show the form

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,640
maybe people have already made up their

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,800
minds and

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,400
want to definitely contribute to one of

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,319
the three projects that

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,680
you've already seen to either skunk or

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,000
faraday

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,119
do they have to type the thing over here

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,500
no

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,160

00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,160
[Music]

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,440
so if you either want to you're already

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,040
convinced that you want to

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,680
contribute to either skunk or faraday

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,119
or to ruby formatter project you can

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,480
already pick your project

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,280
by navigating to the form that we have

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,000
on the screen right now probably if

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,559
arnold

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,040
uh is doing his job in stream yard oh my

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,359
gosh

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:37,040
it just works um thankless job

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,160
thank you so you can go there and pick

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,880
your project

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,160
we want to know from you why you pick

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,640
this particular project

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,839
because we're just interested and we we

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,079
want to learn from

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,440
from why you're picking one project over

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,119
the other maybe

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,720
to figure out what kind of projects we

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,559
want to have on for next

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,359
editions that apparently take place

00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,559
every quarter i just i just found out

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,040
um so you can already go and do that or

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,200
again

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,440
pitch your own project we'll make sure

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,200
to come back to you once we have

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,319
our last uh maintainer of the day

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,640
and and uh we'll make sure to to post

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,359
all of the videos of uh the project

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,880
pages

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,559
on youtube so you can check them out

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
later during the day still

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,240
so also for the people that are joining

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,280
a little bit later because you know it's

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,800
early for us

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,960
in central european time zone

00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
but uh but it's much earlier in other

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,040
time zones so if there's other people

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,880
joining

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,640
later on they can still check out the

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,839
project pages and join you

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,400
in the discord channels so yeah i think

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,079
we'll take

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,440
a little break until we have the last

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,200
project pitch

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,119
and then we'll make sure to notify you

00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,760
in discord that the last project page

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,240
is being screened yeah give us a minute

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,880
or two

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,839
give us a little bit and already start

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,319
uh

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,520
going to the discord channels and uh and

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,200
chat with the maintainers

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,359
chat with the with the other people that

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,599
are looking forward to contributing to

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,599
these projects and let's get started

00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,839
hacking

01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,000
so it's not that we well we didn't we

01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,960
did

01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,760
try waiting uh for uh louise but the

01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,920
problem is not

01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,520
uh louise being late is just us being

01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,760
very very very early

01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,679
um we thought that the product pitches

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,360
would take way longer but with

01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,280
pre-recorded videos that are maximized

01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,480
to 5 minutes

01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:59,520
well we just didn't make it and

01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:01,120
yeah so the bad news is that we're going

01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,600
to end the stream but the good news is

01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,239
you have

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,960
more time to work on an actual project

01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:08,080
yay

01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:10,159
for you um so

01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,760
once we are done with uh with this live

01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:15,520
stream uh we're going to

01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,159
um oh no let's let's do the other way

01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,199
around

01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:20,639
the video of jam stash by luis we are

01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,239
going to record it and we're going to

01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,360
share that in discord with you

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:27,040
so um it's bad you can't pick that

01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,840
project yet because you didn't see the

01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,360
pitch yet

01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,360
but if you already know that you want to

01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,960
work on one of the well

01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,560
coolest things in ruby land while you

01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,040
can have all those projects

01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,159
to pick but well i definitely can

01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,719
recommend this one

01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:42,400
but we're going to record the pitch with

01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,280
luis for gem stash and we're going to

01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,760
upload it

01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,199
and also when we finish the stream we

01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,239
can start

01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:51,600
well selecting the the presentation by

01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,440
ola for faraday we're

01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,960
also going to upload that to youtube so

01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,800
that means you can well

01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,480
watch that again if you are somewhat

01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,960
unsure if you want to pick that

01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:04,639
now the videos of ruby format are

01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,199
already uploaded and we

01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,800
share that well i think everywhere right

01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,239
so feel free to

01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,840
re-watch that thing if you want to want

01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,719
to have a look at what ruby formatter is

01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,960
about again

01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,000
um and of course the video of skunk is

01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,280
also shared

01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,880
so watch it again if you're unsure

01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:24,320
just don't watch them all because you're

01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,679
just wasting valuable time

01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,440
so because we're going to close that

01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,440
also means that we won't be watching

01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,600
any comments in youtube anymore which is

01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,719
a good thing because

01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,719
well we have discord go

01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:38,719
to discord this course is going to be

01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,920
your single source of

01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:43,360
comms for everyone we have channels for

01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,639
every project if you pitched your

01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,400
project and you need to have your

01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,560
project added as a channel

01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,760
let us know because we are well happy to

01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,480
provide you a channel

01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,600
um if you have at least another person

01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,800
to work on because

01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,320
we're not going to make a channel for

01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,960
you just to talk to yourself come on

01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,840
that would be

01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,840
insane

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,360
now is by the way the time to pick use

01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:05,679
that form

01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,960
you can really go into that channel in

01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,120
in discord

01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,880
sure work on something fine be

01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,719
productive yay

01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,239
we need to have that information in the

01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,040
form

01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:17,920
because next uh rosconf we want to make

01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,560
sure we pick

01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,360
projects that you actually care about we

01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,960
like to have

01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,639
you working on something that you enjoy

01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,040
and therefore fill out that form

01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,400
because otherwise uh well next rose conf

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,120
is not going to be as much fun as this

01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,480
one

01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,239
and it's really fun because i'm actually

01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,800
standing really low otherwise i would be

01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:35,920
here so

01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:38,960
ah my legs are stretchy which is fun

01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:41,440
um so we'll update all y'all in discord

01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,480
uh what does that mean well we're going

01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,840
to close the stream

01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,360
we're going to make sure you're going to

01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,320
have your communication in there and at

01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,920
the end of the day

01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,000
we're going to recap what have you done

01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:53,360
today the two of us but also

01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
you over there in whatever time zone

01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,360
you're in

01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,440
so we're going to have a live stream

01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,199
again at the end of the day and we'll

01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,400
probably tell you in this discord when

01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:02,719

01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,600
