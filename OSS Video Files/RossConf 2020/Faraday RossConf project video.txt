thank you hello thank you internet

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,720
um i hope you can hear me my name is ola

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,759
i work with matt mattia

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,759
on being a maintainer for fairly fair

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,480
day is a http client

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,480
what's that it's a way to talk http

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
i made some notes here i'm going to try

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
to stick to them

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,279
so that this will be short and sweet and

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,120
we will get to what we want to do today

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,840
faraday is a generic way to talk http

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
you can swap backends as your needs

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
change

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
when changing backend no other app code

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,840
that you wrote

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
needs to change this is useful

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,559
faraday is flexible pluggable etc

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,920
it's a series of pipeline steps that

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,079
ultimately return an answer responds to

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,079
you

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:08,320
that's super but

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,400
we ship built-in middleware and adapters

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,840
and we even have a collection of

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
built-ins if you will

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
and this leads to people mostly using

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,680
the built-ins

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
or perhaps write one of their own

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,200
whereas there already exists a wealth of

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,439
faraday software

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,560
out there great software

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,840
we want to promote that wealth by

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,560
demoting

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:47,280
the built-ins to regular status

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:54,640
so i've made a

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:57,840
short hit list here like if we can make

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,640
like an awesome faraday document

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,360
which is like go here and pick what you

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,759
want

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,280
for your http needs you would be able to

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,239
well select something and it could be a

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,280
lot better

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,640
than what now currently ships like

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:23,120
stock built in with faraday

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:26,480
so a gemification for today

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,480
faraday is just turn 10 and it's

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,959
relied on by everyone a lot of people

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,200
so you'll be helping many people at the

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,239
same time

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,440
well i hope to see you later

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:46,000
on this thing and a sort of technical

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
introduction will be the start of our

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,959
session together

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,959
