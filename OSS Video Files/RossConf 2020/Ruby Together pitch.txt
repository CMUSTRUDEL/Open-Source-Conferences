hi roscott i'm andre arco better known

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,560
as indirect on the internet things

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,160
i've been on the bundler team for 10

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,840
years and i founded ruby together to

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,759
make sure that rubygems.org

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519
bundler and other ruby open source

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,639
infrastructure that everyone depends on

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,600
stays maintained

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,560
and operational since 2015 when ruby

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,359
together started

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
we've accomplished a lot 99.9 uptime for

00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,480
rubygems.org

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,720
zero major outages shipped bundler

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
inside ruby itself via collaboration

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
with ruby core we've released

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,680
several major versions 24 minor versions

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,239
and 167 bug fix releases

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,840
of rubygems and bundler we've also

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,680
merged bundler and rubygems together

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
into a single repository and github

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
organization and we're continuing to

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,960
make them work

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,360
better together over time we also

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
launched stats.rubygems.org to show the

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
community

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,680
who is using rubygems what versions of

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
ruby they're using

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
what ci systems they're using what

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,199
versions of ruby gems they're using and

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
what platforms they're running on

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,879
we've also funded development work on

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,320
other ruby open source projects like

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,520
the ruby toolbox gem stash simplecov

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,360
bridge troll finally we've created a

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
program to pay experienced developers

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
and developers who are just getting

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
started

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
to practice pairing and open source

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,920
development together called ruby me

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
all of our work is 100 funded by

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
individual developers like you

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,960
and companies that depend on ruby for

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,960
their business

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,000
more funding means that we pay more open

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
source developers

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
fund more ruby open source projects and

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,640
run more rounds of ruby me

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
with more participants join ruby

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
together as a member today

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
and help us improve the ruby ecosystem

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,799
and community for everyone

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,799
