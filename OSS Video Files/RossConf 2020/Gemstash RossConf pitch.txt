i work for ombuds a software development

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,079

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,080
where we help companies upgrade to the

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
next version of rails

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,720
if you have any questions about gemstash

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,080
or any of the products that i

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,040
mentioned here uh or how to get involved

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
in open source

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
journal you can reach me with the handle

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,600
ground stock

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:31,119
in twitter or github

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,200
so what is jumpstash

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,200
uh well gemstones is a game hosting gem

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,479
developed under the ruby together

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,119
initiative

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,960
so gemstar is one of the projects that

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,680
uh ruby together

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,399
sponsors along with ponder uh the

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,399
rubygems client

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,399
rubygems.org

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
uh jensen she's a private gem source and

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
a cache

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,759
server for games so for example if you

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
have a gem that you don't want to share

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
with the

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,040
outside world inside your inside your

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,000
organization

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
you can use gemstash as a private gen

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
server

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,319
and give access to your gems to just

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,840
people within your organization

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,239
you can also configure gemstash as a

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,040
rubygems.org

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,480
cache server so the next time you bundle

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,560
install or your teammate

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,120
want to install instead of going on

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,840
their way to rubygems.org

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
it will try to reach the game from the

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
game

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
cache server

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,360
we have documentation uh how to set up a

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,720
private game host um

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,200
on github uh but if you have any

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,000
problem setting that up you can let me

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,040
know

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,160
uh there is also a really cool blog post

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,200
that michael eber wrote

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,160
about how he set up a gemstashtabber in

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,160
his organization

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,959
so yeah what is the state of em stash

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,599
right now

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,599
uh we have may be making steady progress

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,000
in the um stash codebase uh

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,440
we have been updating all gems uh

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,560
dropping support

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
for all ruby versions uh improving the

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,840
specs

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,840
on fixing a pbox

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,560
we also participated participated this

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
year in the

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
google summer of code where we had a

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
really cool feature

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
our student worked on adding an s3

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,000
backend to jumpstart

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
so jam slash so that is really cool

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,680
because

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
yep now not only can store jumps locally

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,239
but also

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,239
you will be able to configure it

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,640
using aws s3 uh this is a feature that

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
