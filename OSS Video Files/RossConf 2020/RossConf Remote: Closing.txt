place

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
to try and make sure that everything is

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,879
our goal today in faraday was to extract

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
code out of

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,759
faraday into packages with their own

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,840
release cycle

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:58,319
and um that worked

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
we were joined by a bunch of people

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,440
i will name the people who

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
finished projects they started and

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,960
finished extractions of

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,319

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,280

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,440
into ecology around it

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,640

posted or where you could have

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,839
discussions i'm sure

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,360
they can post in the discord channel

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,320
where they would have like to have those

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
discussions

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
um we'll keep the discord channel around

also for

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,959

what happened with the skunk project

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
over these last couple of hours uh so

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,240
anestho

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,000

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,480
um i

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,279
wonder if i can share my screen just to

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,519
have some visual aid

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,519
um

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,279
of course it's not as simple as that

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,480
okay well no screen for me

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,200
but um i'll just do a quick update

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,480
uh i don't know a lot to share but um

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,760
yeah rahul rahul brought

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,600
um helped us with a couple of

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,399
contributions uh he helped on the skunk

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,519
fyi

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,560
project which is our server for

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,399
tracking uh skunk information i

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,800
submitted a pull request to

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,920
make sure we don't track the database

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,399
yaml file

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839
um and we have a bin setup that works

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,519
better

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,079
um i did a little bit of work myself as

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,839
well

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:33,279
i added support for simple cough

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,920
019 and 018 it was like

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,800
a big change between the two versions

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,760
and

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,079
well skunk relies on civil simple club

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,519
so

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:48,640
now it's uh anyway it works with

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,640
two the two versions right now um

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,320
[Music]

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,000
what else um oh rahul

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,120
and i paired a little bit we used

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,959
tuple for that and we worked a little

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,800
bit in the sharing feature

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,760
we wanted to make it easier for

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,320
people who are using skunk to basically

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,279
pass

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,880
in an environment variable to share

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,399
their skunk data

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,880
um and we got 90

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,000
there but then there was a problem in

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,279
the server

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that i'm debugging right now uh but yeah

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,040
i think i

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
look forward to seeing a raul uh pull

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,800
requests

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,200
maybe later or tomorrow um

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,959
and yeah that's that's it in terms of

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,320
updates

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,120
um there are at least

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,519
uh another seven issues out there that

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
are attacked with ross and oktoberfest

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,959
so

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,000
if you like this project and didn't get

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,279
a chance to contribute

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,560
today you can uh still go to our

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,959
github page and find issues there

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,480
um yeah and if you have questions i'll

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,519
stick around the discord

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,800
uh i assume it's gonna continue to live

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,800
there for at least for a couple days

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,839
awesome so people can find on discord

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
and you also said you labeled issues in

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,240
the repository so people can also just

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
go straight to the issue tracker on

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,560
github and

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,200
discuss with you there right yeah thank

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,959
you so much

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
for doing a little report out like we

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
love hearing i mean even though we were

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
like

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
hanging out in some of the channels and

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
figuring out what's happening it's still

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,920
fun to hear from you

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
what you've been working on and what you

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
found valuable

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,480
of work on your project so thank you

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,959
cool thank you

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,839
awesome and for the other projects i

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,160
just see

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
i just saw in our little private chat

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
for the organizers that uh ola also

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,880
suggested that next time he wants to

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,160
work

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,760
on the gem stash project so next time

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,440
you can't bring another project with you

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
and you have to just contribute to the

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,600
other projects

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,560
um and so that so apparently that will

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
be happening

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,160
um and then for the ruby formatter uh

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
project

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,680
uh penelope wanted to stress again that

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
she would love for you to

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,760
um just try and use ruby formatter and

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
for your use case

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,839
and give her all of the feedback that

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,560
you have from your experience

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
trying and using it um and then there

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,240
was

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
like one special extra project that arno

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
and i worked on

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,560
during this day and arno will do a

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,959
report out for that one it was

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,600
i think for both of us it was the first

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,560
time that we

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,040
really worked on a javascript project

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,240
for

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,639
uh eight consecutive hours uh

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
and it's been interesting so arnold the

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,800
way you want to

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,320
share something oh clearly i want to

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,600
share something

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,000
um yeah

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
well we have some ups and downs and

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,880
strikes and gutters

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,760
we had them during the day one of the

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,399
apps was well the lunch was fantastic

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,880
also dinner was quite good um i've been

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,320
fiddling with javascript which is

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,199
entertaining um also i miss judge i

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
think ruby is

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,199
a fantastic language you built a

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,240
front-end

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,959
heavy thing in even if it's just

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,440
a site for just a small small small

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
project

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,880
because i really understand that

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,000
language i really love the language

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,240
and with javascript uh well

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
i think i'm dangerous in it but i don't

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,399
think i'm very

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
good at it so i've been enjoying a lot

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,720
i've been

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,000
asking for well uh shall we circle back

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
on the decision because

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,160
well sunk off fallacy i know we said yes

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,480
to this thing and we've invested

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,240
let's say six hours in it already but

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,199
potentially it's going to be more cost

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
effective to just

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,320
well revert that silly decision throw

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,199
javascript out of the window

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079
and continue with something that we know

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,680
and love

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,399
and then she she looked at me with those

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
puppy other things

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,120
but but we can actually learn something

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
else from this

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,279
and then i thought well sure let's do

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,040
this

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,959
so um well um can i have a

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,199
can i have a look at this thing because

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,920
um well

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,680
yeah so um the most important thing is

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,720
we are in in

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,000
dire need of some css love because it

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,639
looks like it has a

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
terminal disease at the moment i mean it

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,040
can happen but it's not going to be very

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,079
interesting

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,279
uh looking website and also we have a

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,480
request for a

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,480
logo we shared the repository you can

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
you can see that we share the repository

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,120
so anyone who wants to help us out with

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,839
styling or designing a logo there's just

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,959
one issue in the repository

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,279
well there are a lot of issues in

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,720
repository we just created one issue in

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,839
the github repository

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,600
uh that's for that logo and uh because

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,360
i know i suck at javascript but i know

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
that i'm terrible at

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
designing things and styling things so

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,640
that is

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,679
it and let's just hope that it will be

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,199
useful before we do our next iteration

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,880
of rosconf and i think for this

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,559
we go back to floor right right

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,799
because when we open today uh arnold

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,559
already said that uh he was looking

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,039
forward to having a roscomm

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,160
every quarter and so you shouldn't say

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,240
those things around me

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,720
because we already set a date so you can

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,559
save the days for

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,520
february 12th and i just know that rizza

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,280
and tom and the chat

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,799
are going to be like why you too

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,000
like why can't you for once not say

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
things on stream

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
uh but anyway february 12th save the

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,679
date um we'll do a next

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,360
roscomm and let's open a call for

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
projects while we're at it

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,400
so if you have a project that you would

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,520
love to have

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,840
people contribute to or you

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,679
work with a project frequently and maybe

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,280
you have tried your first hand

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,720
contributing to that project and it's

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,919
been a wonderful experience

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
and you want to share that experience

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,440
with others then please suggest

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,320
those projects to either arnold or me

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,559
or generally maybe in the amsterdam ruby

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,880
which is now netherlands rb

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,919
slack or wherever on twitter you can

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,320
find us as well

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,600
um and we'll try and get those projects

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,360
involved for the next

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,280
rosconf so yeah and what else did we

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,200
want to say we wanted to say a couple of

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,799
more things well we'll keep discord

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,320
that's what we said already

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,600
um and uh as ernesto also said probably

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,240
there will be some some

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,000
uh level of engagement there for the

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,880
next couple of days

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,559
and then figure out how to how to work

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
together with maintainers uh

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,640
how they would like to see their

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,520
contributions uh that you will work on

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,039
beyond roscomm because let's let's like

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
