Title: Scott Lobdell: Programming an Autonomous 20 Foot Blimp with Python - PyCon 2014

Description: 
	Speaker: Scott Lobdell

This talk documents the journey of a less than conventional robotics application in which python is used as the logical controller of an autonomous 20 foot blimp. The blimp's autopilot features, prolonged air time, large size, and smooth motion make it the ideal platform for aerial photography. Giving the blimp an onboard controller reduces the overall costs and requirements of the operation.
