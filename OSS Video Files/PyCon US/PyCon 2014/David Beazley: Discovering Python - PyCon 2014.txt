Publication date: 2014-04-24
Playlist: PyCon 2014
Description: 
	Speaker: David Beazley

So, what happens when you lock a Python programmer in a secret vault containing 1.5 TBytes of C++ source code and no internet connection? Find out as I describe how I used Python as a secret weapon of "discovery" in an epic legal battle.

it looks like there's still a few people

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,450
coming in in fact a steady stream of

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,340
people coming in if there is some space

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,350
in your row if you could please defrag a

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,350
bit it would make life a lot easier

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,220
squeeze up

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,699
yeah

00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,350
well ladies and gentlemen it's great to

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,260
see a completely packed house here for

00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,309
our last session after lunch here at

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,720
PyCon 2014 in Montreal it's quite clear

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:04,239
that our next speaker needs no

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,220
introduction

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,220
nor are everybody please welcome pythons

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:17,210
favorite mad scientist Steve Beasley all

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,500
right all right thank you very much this

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,050
is my attempt to come up with the most

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,340
boring talk title and pie at the PyCon

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,070
it was actually one of the reviews and

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,380
the submission if I could set a terrible

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,470
title um so what this what this talk is

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,179
about it's kind of weird topic in 2005 I

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,979
was actually hired to go look at one and

00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,050
a half terabytes of source code in a

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,520
secret vault we'll talk about how you

00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,070
get that much source code in a second

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,289
and then six years later I ended up

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,380
testifying about concurrency and event

00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:47,060
loops and US District Court you're

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,200
thinking oh good god what was that about

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,610
it was not to judge Wapner by the way

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,270
and so what this talk is about is

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,500
actually discovering with Python

00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,450
basically bringing Python into a legal

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,330
battle I think in this picture the chair

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,520
is Python okay so like what this is

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,580
about and just to kind of kind of set

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,009
this up I love this claim or everything

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,750
in this talk is true but all the names

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,489
and details have been changed because a

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,230
nondisclosure I'd have to kill you and

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,680
it would take a long time in this room

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,910
and so so basically the gist of it is I

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,709
know nothing and you're gonna learn

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,569
nothing so just keep that in a queue

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:30,140
time right now to set this up get a meet

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:34,910
Alice got it needed Alice and Bob meet

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,040
Alice meet Bob are we talking about

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,650
cryptography I don't know okay so Alice

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,050
and Bob Bob for whatever reason wants to

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,930
send Alice a message that that she will

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,510
understand and to do this he's going to

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,569
employ an attorney

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:54,140
Bob's attorney Van Daan there and the

00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:56,060
attorney is going to nuke Alex with a

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,150
patent infringement lawsuit along with

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,830
an evil laugh I don't know what happened

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,190
between the two of them to cause this

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,720
but patent infringement lawsuit al

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,060
being fortunate has somehow managed to

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,780
find lawrence lessig to defend her or

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,190
who's going to crush van in this in this

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,340
battle here but basically what this talk

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,750
is about is essentially patents in some

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,980
sense i mean these are things that you

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,170
hear about a lot in the news you know

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,550
patent infringement and software patents

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,790
there are other and all this

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,040
stuff I'm not I'm not gonna really talk

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,770
so much about that except to say that if

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,900
you ever get into a patent litigation it

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,580
will turn your world upside down

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,100
for reasons we'll get into in a second

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,200
and it's also something that is kind of

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,360
the background of this talk I'm you say

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,220
well ok why did why did Dave sit in a

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,770
vault with one-and-a-half terabytes of

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,500
source code he was basically in the

00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:51,050
context of a patent litigation and and

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,970
where it came up it's sort of in this

00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,160
this timeline of what happens in a

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,310
patent lawsuit what happens in these

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,400
lawsuits is that some you know the suit

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,410
will get filed and then it kind of goes

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,880
quiet for a while I mean like you've

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,260
kind of follow the news you know it's

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,650
like oh some company sues there's only

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,360
one and it circles quiet be the case

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,910
essentially goes into a phase of known

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,010
as fact discovery which might last a

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,510
year maybe even more but it goes it goes

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,549
on for a while

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,850
and essentially what in what's going on

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:24,350
in that fact discovery phase is the

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,910
lawyers and the teams are trying to

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,610
figure out just what in the world is

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,750
going on essentially what you have is

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,060
you have like the plaintiff in a case

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,430
it's saying well there's obvious patent

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,740
infringement right an earthworm versus a

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,720
snake right know what that's about

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,040
you have the defendant essentially

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,930
saying well no they're things are

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,020
obviously different right there is no

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,510
infringement yeah so you have you have

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,930
these two sides and what is happening in

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,740
in this sort of fact discovery is that

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,930
that the two sides essentially have to

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,460
take a data from the case which might be

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,700
things like specifications and drawings

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,830
and documents and software and so forth

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,940
and sort of figure out what the you know

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:10,160
quote facts are in this legal case and

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,680
you know in it's not usually a really

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,180
clear-cut thing many times right I mean

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,010
it's it's it's not an obvious thing

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,350
where it's obviously different or it's

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,460
obviously obviously of

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,830
the same so to do this usually what

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,390
happens is a fact expert or an expert

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,150
witness or somebody like that is called

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,380
in to look at the look at the facts and

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,460
in the case of something involving

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,950
software it could be somebody in this

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,290
room myself in this case I mean you know

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,610
typically what that what lawyers are

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,730
looking for some kind of technical

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,860
expert that is unbiased meaning not

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,720
employed by either the parties or have a

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,340
relationship with them it would be

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,990
somebody that wouldn't hopefully know

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,420
somebody so they typically tend to

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,880
target like university professors people

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,080
like that you know that that know things

00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,000
and essential they're gonna they're

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,770
gonna look look at the facts in the case

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,690
and what you're gonna have it's kind of

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,220
a you know a team it looks something

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,370
like this you know maybe Bob's attorney

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,900
you have a bunch of co-workers you like

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,000
legal these are these are usually like

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,830
the the people to law firm who haven't

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,730
made partner yet they're like their jobs

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,770
on the line fact expert in reality it's

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,890
actually probably more like this

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,950
Bob's attorney with with co-workers the

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,860
fact expert it looks like that in my

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,630
case that that's me that's actually what

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,610
it looks like to bike in the Chicago

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,200
winter by the way I don't know whether

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,030
people saw the first talk in this

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,340
session but they're talking about biking

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,980
in Montreal so I would assume it's kind

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,500
of similar though so so that's that's

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,610
kind of the team and if this happens to

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,070
you it's actually a really fascinating

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,690
experience like if you get get the call

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,280
so to speak saying hey why don't you

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,770
come in and look at some source code for

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,240
a patent infringement suit you're

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,880
essentially going to be dropped into

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,290
just a huge firestorm of hell actually

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,730
okay because what's gonna happen is

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,030
they're gonna drop you into this case

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,920
with no technical guidance really and

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,120
the reason that they don't they're the

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,170
reason they can't give any guidance is

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,850
that's because they could why they

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,250
called you actually they don't know

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,290
what's going on so so some of the things

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,700
that they're gonna happen is you're

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,040
gonna get end up getting into this like

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,000
really quick learning say it's phase

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,860
where it like well you have to learn

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,560
what the invention is like what is this

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,140
patent is it good bs like what is it

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,510
about to do that you're gonna get all

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,979
sorts of really fun reading assignments

00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,510
like you'll have to read the patent

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,310
itself which might look something like

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,710
this where it's like

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,630
you know the system of claim five or six

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,640
where in the display and input means

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,280
comprise this display means I'd like you

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,350
read that and and like you know it's

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:47,900
like your head just stick head explodes

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:51,350
it's from the movie scanners which is a

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,760
great Canadian work of art actually okay

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:58,040
so so so you have the you have that in

00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,740
in the case of in the case of this thing

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,820
the patent actually had 600 pages of C

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,030
code attached to it as a PDF printed in

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,000
1989 on like a dot matrix printer and

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,470
you get these fun jobs so it's like okay

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,560
you have this just what do you do with

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,440
this code I ended up having to basically

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,580
compile the code from hand I mean this

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,070
is something like if you're going in as

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:25,040
an expert it's like is this patent like

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,970
CBS like does it even work could you

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,870
explain this code to two other people so

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,520
one of the very first things that

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,800
happens is you have to you have to

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,490
figure out this invention in the case of

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,870
this thing actually printed out all of

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,150
the code and sat down with a highlighter

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,040
over the weekend and highlighted all

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,040
function definitions and all function

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,480
calls it was only available in paper

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,160
basically right it's like you print it

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,860
out you highlight all function calls you

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,440
highlight all all function definitions

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,890
and so forth and then I ended up using

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,090
Python to manually link it I essentially

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,060
you would you would enter it into just

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,280
Python data structures from you know a

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,080
paper copy and then you would just crank

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,330
it through Python to do like a manual

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,190
link and what's going on here is I'm

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,810
actually trying to figure out whether

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,460
that code is actually complete does it

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,260
have code does it have holes in it are

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,000
there like missing chunks on it chunks

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,610
in the code that kind of that kind of

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,730
thing I'm not going to explain that

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,700
Python code and in great detail except

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,350
to say that if you're not using list

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,660
comprehensions and set comprehensions

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,970
and the collections module you are

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,100
missing out on an awesome secret weapon

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,100
for getting all sorts of problem solved

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,920
okay so so you you you you sit down for

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,420
a weekend you link this code you would

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,310
say well why would you why would you do

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,960
that one of the things that will happen

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,600
in this

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,760
case is it at some point if it continues

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,060
far enough you're going to be asked

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,770
about that cone maybe like under oath or

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,880
something like that and if you don't

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,680
know how it works

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,470
you're gonna look really freaking bad

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,390
right okay so and so you you will die

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,870
basically later if you don't understand

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,310
the go so so part of what happens is you

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,160
have to understand your like your own

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,800
sides go so that's kind of interesting

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,870
sort of horrible in a way I might be the

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,930
only person who's had to link a 600-page

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,750
C program by hand on paper and apply

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,070
signs scripts oh so you do that but then

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,810
it but then it actually gets it gets

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,950
even more interesting in these cases you

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,210
actually have to deal with the other

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,520
side so so you have Alice here what is

00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,380
what is gonna happen you know on that

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,480
side is that you're essentially dealing

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,220
with like a whole different organization

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,260
you're the only like some some company

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,880
they're very hostile to you so you know

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,760
you have Alice's group of sort of ninja

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,710
rock star coders you know that have been

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,500
that have been doing things because

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,230
you're filing probably a path like a

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,450
like since you're finally in a lawsuit

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,940
you would actually probably not be suing

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,130
somebody with no money so it's probably

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,070
actually not a bunch of ninja rock star

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,890
coders actually instead probably what

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,320
Alice has is a bunch of engineers and

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,480
they're probably SEI cmmi level 4

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,020
certified with like an ISO 9000

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,730
certification okay so you know it this

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,620
is the other side and something like

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,090
this is typically not like a startup

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:25,180
company okay it's something else and

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:28,150
what they're going to do is essentially

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,040
kill you with with with documents now

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,530
this is it's insane so it's like in this

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,240
case you show up the lawyers actually

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,870
took me to a room and they said hey yeah

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,670
we got some printouts you know can you

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,730
take a look at the printouts and just to

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,580
put it like a number on it

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:50,320
Rema paper is 500 pages a box of paper

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,660
is 5,000 pages they had a hundred boxes

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,460
of printed paper five hundred thousand

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,140
pages printed actually literally printed

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,940
out in a

00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:03,079
stacked up I didn't know what it was

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:06,050
300,000 pages of it were TPS reports

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:08,100
software change notices things like that

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,750
you know that they don't don't what to

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:16,860
do with some of the other stuff that you

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:17,760
find in their quote source code a lot of

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,200
people don't know anything in these

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,730
legal cases like oh yeah let's just

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,829
print out the object files I don't

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,329
really mess with them right okay so you

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,450
know print out it spin out source code

00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:29,130
you might get box of emails you know

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,630
like here's an email from Guido or he

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,550
says hey if I were to design new

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,140
language I probably use braces right and

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,209
you can like you can take that to the

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,890
lawyers and say oh I found this smoking

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,800
gun in the email about something okay

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,930
so so you find that you'll get things

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,329
like alleged prior art from all over the

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,980
place like schematics you might get

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,070
software where you don't even know what

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,529
in the world it is from like 1983 or you

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,880
know assembly code you know it's like I

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,110
don't know does anybody actually

00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:01,140
recognize that and I think that's P Oh

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,750
86 well so it's something like this you

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,769
get a whole bunch of unrecognized stuff

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,839
the legal team might actually be

00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,120
deposing people at the time so you might

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,060
get like a deposition of some crazy gray

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,399
bearded guy right you know so so you

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,380
know it he'll kind of you know bring out

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,390
some stuff saying well yeah I thought of

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,920
this in my basement well though you know

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,370
over the winter holiday or something

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,870
like that so so you're gonna get that

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,699
and then and then the really fun part is

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,560
you're gonna get all their software -

00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:30,209
this is in some way kind of awesome

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,800
because when you're getting to a legal

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,050
case they can go to the other side they

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,949
can ask for anything you say hey why

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,230
don't you just give us the whole

00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:40,649
codebase hand it over and it's all

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,560
proprietary proprietary software in the

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,120
case of this they asked for the software

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,079
and it was actually sitting over in a

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,810
vault on the west side of Chicago and

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,510
just just a put some perspective on this

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,839
so it so imagine that this is the

00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:00,029
Chicago here essentially the smite owed

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,769
to my kids here you you have sort of

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,839
this vault in kind of a secret location

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,540
that is actually a picture of the real

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,790
vault by the way sort of nondescript

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,970
nondescript building sort of nestled by

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,329
the

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,490
train tracks and coincidentally right

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:18,120
next to the rock band rehearsal space

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,470
that I was you can yeah yeah I'm

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,959
actually getting that picture by the way

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,759
there's a part of the rock band there so

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,970
so it's kind of nestled in this very

00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,250
sketchy part of town the protocol for

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,379
the vault is you can't have any

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,629
computers no phone no electronics no

00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,699
storage and that's you can bring a pen

00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,629
and paper book that that's pretty much

00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:40,110
it

00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:43,439
they had a PC locked in a cage along

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,379
with a printer in a log book so that so

00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:48,480
that was what was in there as far as

00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,149
what be found there it was just a large

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,529
collection of hard drives basically you

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,470
know maybe a one-and-a-half terabytes of

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,350
hard drives and as far as at what it was

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,660
there it looked like they took maybe a

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,730
gigantic box of compact discs and they

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,050
just copied it on there in no order

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,449
whatsoever

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,129
I'll say a little bit more about what it

00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,300
is in a second but just you know just

00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:10,800
imagine it's like going through your

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,329
closet and you say I'm gonna find every

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,740
compact disc that I see in the whole

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,689
room and I'm just gonna send it over to

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,240
the other side they're gonna put it on

00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:20,699
this machine so no no organization at

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,829
all and just to just to put a little

00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:24,990
perspective on how horrible this is in a

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:26,730
way they essentially produced like the

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,399
software archive for pretty much

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,829
everything related to this thing so you

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,000
kind of have the invention and the

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,559
things that they were producing were

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,529
things like you have like embedded

00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,410
microcontrollers you had keypads display

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:44,069
module seven segment displays you had a

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,199
PC they had made a custom PCI board with

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:49,019
its own custom operating system custom

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,180
software for that system actually

00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,410
involved a second PC so you have like

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,029
all these different components you

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,920
actually had all the software for all of

00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,240
these things like so if you wanted to

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,430
know what the firmware was in the

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,920
display like the LCD display module you

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,649
had that yeah so they kind of gave you

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,300
the whole the whole works it was

00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,970
actually more of a distributed system in

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,949
fact so there's like a custom router

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,629
multiple copies of devices um the

00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,939
software for this is like what I would

00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:18,089
describe is all stack not just full

00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:19,980
stack but like all stack so so you have

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:23,190
like essentially about a million lines

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,730
of code involving C++ C a

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,690
Java Visual Basic assent you know it's

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,150
sort of things like they had their own

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,910
distributed object system decom CORBA

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,560
hold the whole the whole works there and

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,870
then on top of that the time frame of

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,330
this of this thing was basically over 15

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,310
years so it turns out how do you get at

00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,500
one-and-a-half terabytes you basically

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,470
hand off about 800 snapshots of that

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,890
system over like a 15 year period with

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,640
all sorts of multiple hardware revisions

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,970
configurations different operating

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,770
systems OS to Windows NT and so forth

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,870
and then on top of that they had like

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,150
custom sort of skins on this software

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,500
customized for a big corporate client so

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,520
it's like there's like a big core of the

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,430
system then there's like all these

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,680
custom skins on it all sorts of hundreds

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,079
of interlocking versions and so forth

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,329
and so and so what my job is is

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,630
basically to tell the lawyers like what

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:19,949
is this thing and the provided tools or

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:23,600
Windows XP awesome the Windows command

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,610
prompt awesome the search mutt

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,070
alright so yeah awesome I don't know

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,900
whether I yea people remember the

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,390
Windows XP search mutt but yep pretty

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,220
pretty awesome you could use notepad

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,770
ball because that came with Windows and

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,430
then because they were feeling generous

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:45,360
they've had Visual Studio ok so you had

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:47,130
all these all these tools on there you

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,230
could print anything that you wanted it

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,000
turns out in the vault but it had to be

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,550
logged and it was copied and given to

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,260
the other side nothing really happens in

00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,790
like secret and a lot of these lawsuits

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,920
like if you're gonna print something out

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,840
because you think it's interesting the

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,640
other side is gonna get it too okay so

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,470
you know you could you could you could

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,420
you could do that but the other side

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,070
would know what you were doing and then

00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,230
there is some other constraints as well

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,570
there was actually no working hardware

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,040
setup couldn't run the code you actually

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,500
couldn't build the code either because

00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,640
of missing libraries no tech support

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,130
like you can't just call up the other

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,480
side saying hey we're a I'm working for

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,760
the guys who are suing you I'm kind of

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,010
confused about this code and you know

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,680
tell me about it so so it's that and

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,350
it's very fragmentary documentation so

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,380
so you look at this and you say oh that

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:37,530
it's horrible so here's the here's the

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,890
interesting thing it turns up it on in

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:43,559
the vault one go over there I fire up

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:47,789
the command prompt I type Python it

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:50,250
comes up and wait how did it come up

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,140
like like no no it's like I mean this is

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,450
this is odd right this is odd I mean if

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,870
you've ever used Python on Windows does

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,210
it get installed in the path no right

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,270
it's in the path like who put it there

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,630
and in the path the only the only guests

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:09,330
on this is that it was probably used by

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,830
IBM as an as part of an OEM tool I was

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,480
actually talking to Brian Curtin about

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,890
this at one point because he does some

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,900
stuff with the Python window is he's

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,059
like oh yeah we got we got occasional

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,650
like virus reports from user is saying

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,230
hey what's this Python thing on my

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,030
machine I just bought it it was used by

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,270
something by the vendor so turns out it

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,100
was there for reasons unknown and of

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,539
course that sort of changed the whole

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,340
picture right I mean if you've ever had

00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:34,169
this this this thought like oh you know

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,080
Python be really awesome desert island

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:39,419
language this this is like the perfect

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,409
chance to like try that theory out right

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:45,929
I'd say bad battery batteries included

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:49,950
by good fortune I actually wrote the

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,900
Python book right so so I was allowed to

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,610
bring books into the vault I'm like okay

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,940
I'm gonna I'll be back I'm gonna be at

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,350
my book and kind of the the strategy on

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,120
this is I'm gonna go in there and I'm

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,520
gonna build a basically software

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,760
entirely from scratch in the ball to do

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,530
this and so I'm gonna talk about that

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,179
before it before I get into that I do

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,590
want to just raise one question if like

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,320
what what are the what are the

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,390
objectives of this exercise exactly like

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,830
I mean this is a very unusual project

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,860
where like the lawyers are just saying

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,710
hey look at the code and it's like we

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,270
didn't look at like what is that so if I

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,520
if I had to describe the objectives

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,380
they're kind of this I'm one of them was

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,659
just sort of this what question like

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,309
what did they give us because nobody

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,840
actually knows they know that there's a

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,179
bunch of hard drives in there but like

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,669
what is it the the other thing is just

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,110
how does it actually work we'll get to

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,909
that and then the third one is the more

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,740
weird one is like because this is a

00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,440
patent case ultimately you're gonna have

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,850
to answer

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,960
we're in that code does the patent exist

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,360
and that's the weirdest that's the

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,490
weirder one so so some of the some of

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,200
the horror on this essentially the first

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,120
part of it is you're gonna have to

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,160
reverse engineer the whole build

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,330
environment of whatever this is like

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,280
finding like well what are the

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,630
components how do they get built are

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,430
they complete like what are they are

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,280
they exe s are they dll's or they

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,170
plugins you might have to do something

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,000
like just pick like some you've just

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,680
picked like a directory of code and you

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,110
see if you can pull it apart you might

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,850
look at things like make files you know

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,860
saying okay well your sources here's

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,050
libraries this is a lot of like just

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:27,310
pencil paper or like grunt work we're

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:30,270
just like Oh dad it's horrible it's like

00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:33,130
the last talk assembling I actually

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,810
don't ask how I stole this picture from

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,570
Titus Browns last talk in the last

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,720
section here it's copyright infringement

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,910
I know it's like it's a it's like a

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,220
jigsaw puzzle where it's like you it's

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,620
like okay here all the pieces go go put

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,710
it together so some of the ways that you

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,720
that you do this is but well the first

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:56,110
thing it should be obvious is you have

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,810
to re-implement unix okay so so that's

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:02,350
the that's the first the first step so a

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:05,530
lot of it yeah it gives at the search

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,600
mud no I mean okay so you have to you

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,390
you have to do some basic two-lane to do

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,370
this it turns out to be like pretty easy

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,960
to do a lot of that I mean one of the

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,190
things that you can do is use the like a

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Python you get like you can just

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,710
implement like basic unix commands using

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,310
like simple Python statements you know

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,290
like basic navigation stuff this is a is

00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:30,010
that a six line a six line program that

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:32,470
will do diff between two files Python

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,240
has dip you don't need to you can we can

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,470
you can dude if a new kind of build up

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
like a little like a little collection

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,000
of tools and then you might just use the

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,860
Python interactive shell to just do your

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,720
navigation because the Windows command

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,910
shell kind of sucks you know it's like

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,290
you don't want to use that so so in

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,500
actually in one sense what you're doing

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:54,970
here is is you're kind of building your

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,280
own eye Python from scratch I mean it's

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,390
a it's a very stripped-down one but

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,070
you're literally just sitting over there

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,650
with the book saying I'm gonna reinvent

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,100
everything I need as I need it in the in

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,960
the vault so just sort of sitting in

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,600
there you can do dips and fines and and

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,800
and and so forth but then what you but

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,410
then what you start to do is you start

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,910
to start to layer on this thing you say

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,500
okay well I've got UNIX but now I'm

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,840
gonna start doing some some some

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,260
workflow kinds of things where you might

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,250
you might do things like okay you write

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,720
a feel like you might just start with a

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,450
Python functional here's a function that

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,230
will produce every single directory name

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,610
and file name on the whole machine I

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,160
tested this out with like every Python

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,720
version that exists just a as a sample

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,310
you might say okay well like if I wanted

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,380
to find all files in all versions of

00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,610
Python I would just fire this at it and

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,650
it would just start spitting out files

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,180
and then that would that would become

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,830
you know maybe a component in your

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,330
system and then you would start building

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,130
things on top of it where you would say

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,170
well you know what did they give us

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,550
exactly like what are all the file types

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,100
of everything on all those

00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,470
one-and-a-half terabytes of disk you'd

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,240
say do something like this saying oh I'm

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,060
gonna make a histogram of all file types

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,680
and just kind of kind of see what's

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,570
there like how many Python files are

00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,650
there how many C files are there you

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,540
might actually look for things that are

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,700
really interesting like unusual file

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,110
formats I actually some of the more

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,590
interesting things would be things like

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,090
PDF files and doc files for reasons that

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,040
we'll get into later but you kind of

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,200
kind of inspect what's there maybe that

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,330
would become a another component maybe

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,250
you would write some code to find like

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,080
find things you know you're saying okay

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,790
I want to find all Python files I want

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,130
to do a search and again you're trying

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,660
to you're trying to uncover things on

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,420
this huge collection of hard drive

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,310
images or CD images so you do things do

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,590
things like that you might write little

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,690
utility things where I want to I want to

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:47,380
create a manifest of all versions of

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,490
code you know provided to us it's just

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,410
my excuse to put a regular expression

00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,480
and the you know and the talk there so

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,610
you would do things like this maybe run

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,040
it and identify like all versions of

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,020
Python and and and so forth so you kind

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,490
of build up like tools where you would

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,170
say things like okay identify what's

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,080
there and then maybe start writing out

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,780
manifests you're essentially doing a big

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,640
inventory job of searching through all

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,950
this data find all the versions of

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,850
things trying to put it together the

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,440
whole time you're you

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,630
sort of you know consulting with lawyers

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,490
in LA saying I was over there and I

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,090
found you know 700 versions of the

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,550
software

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,400
you know just FYI or you know there's

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:27,280
you know 700 versions it's a million

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,190
lines of C code that that kind of thing

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,200
and so you do kind of you can't you kind

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,090
of build up these these workflows and

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,490
then you can just start piling it up

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,780
sort of sort of even higher I mean one

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,140
of the things that happened in this

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,270
project is that the these snapshots were

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,280
just sort of scattered randomly over all

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,790
the discs it was too hard to deal with

00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:51,160
so I'm sort of implemented kind of a I

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,800
don't know a sort of virtual file system

00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,330
if you will it's kind of a layer where

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,250
you could just enter in like a like a

00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,930
software version and it would just take

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,400
you there and you didn't have to worry

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,900
about all the way that was actually

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,290
structured so you kind of kind of layer

00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,390
it up and some of the stuff that you

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,980
would do there or just take all these

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,870
software versions you would find out

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,910
things like development timelines like

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,830
all the versions like how what range of

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,990
dates did they go over do they did they

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,020
overlap in some sense you're almost

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,910
reconstructing things like IDE github

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,680
you know like you know forking you know

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,880
like history or something like that

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,560
you're doing it almost in Reverse

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,930
actually you're taking like a bunch of

00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,030
snapshots and trying to recreate history

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,130
from in some other things that you would

00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,600
do is are right like write code or you

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,490
would say things like oh give me every

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,850
version of this file that has ever

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,710
existed like you could say you know like

00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,690
like you could you pick like a version

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,100
and like I'm using Python as an example

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,230
but you could say hey give me every

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,900
version of thread that C that has ever

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,760
existed and it would it would go through

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,290
these like 800 snapshots and then it

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,180
would produce like some history saying

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,550
well you know in in version 1 and 2 and

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,410
1 3 it was exactly the same and then

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,670
like you know Oh like version 2 all the

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,830
way up to two point one point three

00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:04,780
there's like you know seven versions of

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,980
code where it is exactly the same again

00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,510
what you're trying to do is take all

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,590
this stuff and decompose it and break it

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:13,330
down and and do inventories on it you

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,010
there were also a lot of navigational

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,360
tooling like if you needed to go

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,860
somewhere you could write little view

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,050
functions or you'd say hey I want to

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,310
look at see eval in this version of

00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,890
Python and then maybe it would launch

00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,910
Visual Studio or something because you

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,700
know I didn't have a whole lot of choice

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,620
on editor

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,019
you can't you can't install anything on

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,269
this machine so sort of work with work

00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:34,600
with what you've got so you you sort of

00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:37,880
build up you build up all this stuff and

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,559
you know one comment on this I'm not

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,470
actually I'm not actually sure that the

00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,720
other side in this case ever anticipated

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,130
that we would figure it out like I mean

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,080
I think that was kind of the expectation

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,539
it's like we're gonna take every CD in

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,860
the closet you know in archive we're

00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:56,000
just gonna send it to them and let them

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,590
figure it out I think in reality wishi

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,480
almost knew everything about everything

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,460
like we knew all versions of everything

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,600
that they gave us and like timelines and

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,679
all sorts of stuff it was all

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,940
inventoried

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,980
I don't think it would have been

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,750
possible at all without Python like I

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,360
can't even imagine doing that with

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,340
notepad or like the search like the

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,470
search mutt and notepad like how would I

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,510
I was actually I was actually thinking

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,909
about it recently I was like how would I

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:23,000
have done that I guess I mean the only

00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:24,919
alternative would have been to you know

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,929
fire up Visual Studio and then to

00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,809
re-implement Python I mean it's probably

00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:32,630
the only I I just don't know how you

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,669
would how I would do that so so there so

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,700
there's that uh-huh and then and then

00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:39,230
you get into these other like horrible

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,519
things with this code I mean one of the

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,750
things that that okay it's like the

00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,210
thing we just described is just figuring

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,919
out like what is there we haven't even

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,380
talked about how it works it's more like

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,269
just what is it so you have this other

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,519
thing which is well how does this how

00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:54,139
does this code work and this includes

00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,700
pretty much everything like the software

00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:58,490
architecture interaction between

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,279
components algorithms the you know the

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,600
the whole thing I mean as an expert what

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,909
you're gonna have to do is take that

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,590
million line program and you're gonna

00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,690
have to first of all explain it to the

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,610
people that you're working for and then

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,070
maybe later on you might have to explain

00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,539
it to potentially like a jury or

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,039
something like this so you can't just go

00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:19,250
in there for like 20 minutes and say

00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,570
yeah it kind of looked at it so you you

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,880
really have to really have to pull it

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,549
apart and and the thing is like reading

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,080
code is terrible I mean you don't do you

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:29,539
really want to read like a million line

00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,010
program that you didn't write I mean

00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,899
it's it sounds horrible I mean what you

00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,000
want is you want designed acts and specs

00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:37,220
and stuff like that but but the thing is

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,210
the other side is very hostile they

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,000
don't want to they don't want to help

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,000
you

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,940
want to give you that kind of stuff so

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,740
so what ends up happening next is you go

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,560
on what I can best describe is a

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,110
gigantic fishing expedition for things

00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,680
like interesting documents like PDF doc

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:58,320
files RTF HTML text files you do mining

00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,880
of code comments actually one of the

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,470
things we did a lot I'll talk about this

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,960
next slide is you just search all source

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,610
code for the word C and you just see

00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,110
what comes up because what you're hoping

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,700
to some developer has written in like a

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,980
comment like oh this function is really

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,440
tricky if you want more details see this

00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,870
document like you're what you're looking

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,040
for is like a like a like a boost thread

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,020
or something you're looking sports or

00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,340
something to to link off you might go

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,350
through looking through all those TPS

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,300
reports hoping that somebody dropped a

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,830
clue you look through everything I mean

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,420
this is actually you know kind of kind

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,680
of the thing that you would find is you

00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,570
might find a comment that would say

00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:34,230
something like this you know CFS six

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,800
five four one eight V 204 is a detail no

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,750
huh

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,130
that's interesting and this is actually

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,930
one of the cool things about a fact like

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,850
if being a fact expert is you can go to

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,310
the attorneys and you can pretty much

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,320
get them to do to unleash any weapon you

00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,090
want on the other side right you can so

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,380
so you can go to them and you can say

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,360
hey you know I think we would really be

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,590
really cool to have this document FS six

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
five four one eight v2o

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,040
um and so what happens you know the

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,750
attorneys will draw off a letter and

00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,190
send it off and it's kind of silent for

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:03,600
a few days you know it's the other side

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:05,400
is like how about that and then you know

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,010
magically out of the vapor you'll get

00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,650
some document you know Acme widget

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:13,080
functional specification version 2.0 and

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,330
then so you know tag proprietary and

00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,100
confidential and then you know since

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,500
this company has their act together the

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,970
very first page is the related documents

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,650
content and then what you do is you rip

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,880
that off and you give it to the

00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,190
attorneys and say you know if you're

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,190
really cool to get all that stuff to and

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,570
you you basically will unwind the whole

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,290
like system architecture and all the

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:36,030
pieces doing things like that and you

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,950
search everything I mean software change

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,510
notices unreal it you might actually

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,490
look for software on something like a

00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,780
display module like firmware for the

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,820
display module because it might make

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,940
reference to the main application in

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,080
some way and you'll just you'll just

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,880
look at you basically what you trying to

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,230
do is pipe pull on a loose thread you're

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,650
gonna pull on it as far as you can pull

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,930
on

00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,270
and to see how much what their pain

00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,180
point is you know before they they do

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:02,580
that so um so that's that that's another

00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,710
thing that happens one one comment on

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,840
this I actually think that this is an

00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,370
awesome exercise if you ever get a

00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,140
chance to do this regardless of what you

00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,240
think about patents because if you ever

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,620
gets thrown into like a like a fire

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,030
saying hey you need to understand this

00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,640
million line program that you didn't

00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,040
write with no help at all like no

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,230
documentation you're gonna learn a ton

00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,330
of stuff reading that code actually

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,220
about everything like even like like I

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,590
never seen stuff with like CMMI level

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,570
four like this software engineering kind

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,070
of stuff which this group was practicing

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,710
you get to see that stuff like all their

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,290
procedures and their documents and it's

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,309
really fascinating to see that the other

00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,190
thing is you're gonna have to teach

00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:43,380
attorneys about it

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,970
tourneys are not done by the way patent

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,679
attorneys usually have science and

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,380
engineering degrees they're not often

00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,300
not software engineers but they're smart

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,740
guys if you have a smart smart men and

00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,480
women really they can understand it but

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,370
they but but but you're gonna have to

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,590
explain it to them the other side

00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,690
doesn't want you to succeed at this so

00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,700
it is a little bit hostile so you will

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,260
learn a lot some of the things that that

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,110
I learned this is going to get me into

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,809
serious trouble here but this is a these

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,490
are the the sucks rocks lessons of

00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:15,870
having to look at other people's code

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:18,630
that I've learned doing this project C++

00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,030
and assembly code turns out that in

00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,440
assembly code the code is so minimal

00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,500
that it just does what it's supposed to

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,030
do the C++ code needs at least 18 levels

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,179
of indirection and design pattern

00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:32,940
terrible asynchronous and threads now

00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:37,230
I'm really in trouble here you know that

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,840
objects functions IDs make files I

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:46,020
pretty much anything actually developed

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:48,240
since the 1970s you know sort of sort of

00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,500
sort of it's sort of started so no I

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,970
didn't know it is it's kind of amazing

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,350
actually like in these in these cases

00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,600
cuz what they're gonna do is trot out

00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:57,030
things like prior art and they'll say

00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,040
hey yeah we got this prior art from 1975

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,929
can you go take a look at it and you

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,360
look at it it's like this is like three

00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:04,860
pages of code it's cool I could

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,509
understand it right and then you go to

00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,349
you compare it to the million lines

00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:12,990
plus-plus program it's like Oh God like

00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:14,159
we've done everything wrong so so you

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,690
know of course of course I could be

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,730
could be wrong about that

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,109
and then and then the the other sort of

00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,339
weird thing that this is getting into

00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:24,859
the kind of the weirdest part of this

00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:28,019
whole thing in this fact discovery phase

00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:30,629
the attorneys are actually playing a

00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,069
very different kind of game with a

00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:33,179
patent infringement suit I mean they

00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,740
that you're over there looking at the

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,359
software and there's these questions

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,369
like well you know does it infringe or

00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:40,109
not and so forth the attorneys are

00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:43,079
actually playing a kind of a weird chess

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:44,879
game that you will only understand if

00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,059
you understand Bill Clinton's comment

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,470
about you know this famous quote depends

00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,569
on what the meaning of the word is is

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,819
but a lot of people like to laughed at

00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:55,559
that smile idiot you know it's like they

00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:58,349
obviously never been in like a patent

00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:00,450
infringement suit what what is going on

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:02,220
is that the attorneys are basically

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,500
doing with the language of the patent

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,170
like you have this horrible claim that

00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,970
like made your head explode earlier they

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,000
are actually going through that entire

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,460
claim and fighting about it what it

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,690
means like what does this claim mean and

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,430
they're gonna fight and they're gonna

00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,559
fight in front of a judge over an

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:23,009
extended period of time about what this

00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,450
thing means and just just just to give

00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:26,819
you some background if you love

00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:30,150
arguments about things like the Oxford

00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:32,609
comma this is your battle right okay

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,099
like like if you love grammar Artic like

00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:36,480
arguments and and things like that this

00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,119
is this is what they're kind of fighting

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,559
about is things like terms and languages

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,180
like they'll take a claim and they'll

00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,730
say central processing unit what does

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,130
that mean and the defendant will say

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,529
well actually has to be like a model 804

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,329
eighty six you know version two exactly

00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:52,619
a two hundred megahertz the other side

00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,809
will say what could be any computer at

00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,519
all and then you know the plaintiff will

00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:57,630
say well display could be anything the

00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,549
other side well it has to be seven

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,009
segment display and they're gonna fight

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:05,069
over this extensively about what the

00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:06,509
definitions of these terms are and the

00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:09,240
thing is here's here's the catch um

00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:11,400
whatever they decide the terms are it

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,500
actually has to exist in reality like

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,690
you can't have a definition where you

00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,480
say oh yeah yeah the CPU is this and

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,769
then that doesn't exist anywhere like

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,990
you actually have to be able to point at

00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,670
the

00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,470
patent and say well there it is in the

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,850
patent and then on top of that you have

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,470
to point at the other side you have to

00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,060
say well there it is over there so

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,950
they're fighting over these terms you

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:33,130
know essentially trying to define things

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,510
and I was talking to van about this let

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,010
the other night he's like yeah this is

00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,220
like a knob or they can like they can

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:41,290
like turn it up or down to any level of

00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,450
abstraction they want like down to the

00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:46,060
atoms of the universe or all the way up

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,700
to like you know plan a tour so you know

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,950
it's it's it's it's very sort of you

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,450
know malleable in a way so that that's

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,130
the two sides are fighting about this

00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,280
but ultimately what's gonna happen in

00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:58,540
this in this software fact stuff is

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,760
you're gonna have to be able to point at

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,920
something specific like if the attorneys

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,180
say well this is the definition they

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,010
have to be able to go at the code and

00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:11,380
say you know what in this file foo dot C

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:13,750
line 232 255 that's where it is and so

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,510
this is a this is a problem to which is

00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,369
well how are you gonna do that on 800

00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,869
versions of this million line program

00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,200
like I mean you just pick one at random

00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:24,790
and say well we've looked at that one or

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,200
are you know what what do you do the the

00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,170
thing that we did in this project was we

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,490
decided to do all of them at once and

00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:32,290
the way that that was done was doing

00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,960
something I'm gonna call fragment

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,240
versioning it's kind of like source code

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,830
control but applied to individual code

00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,480
fragments essentially what you would do

00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:45,010
is maybe I'm identifying it to the

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,260
patent saying okay well here's this

00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,300
piece of code in question and you would

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,680
mark it off as maybe like a code

00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,150
fragment saying well this is you know

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,040
this is the file that it's in and then

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,320
it starts with this you know this void

00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,780
grok and ends with this void blah or

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,130
whatever and then what you would do is

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,100
write a script that would go through all

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,530
800 snapshots collecting that fragment

00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,910
across all versions and then what it

00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,890
would what it would do is collect all

00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,840
the unique ones that it found like oh

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,280
they found three versions turned out

00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,020
that this was this was highly effective

00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,850
by the way like you would find these

00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,980
versions of code and these like you over

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:20,740
the 800 snapshots you might only find

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,440
like six versions of some fragment and

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,670
really kind of the the thought here is

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,040
that you're trying to reduce this

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,810
massive data set to some kind of sane

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,790
structure where you could say well you

00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,530
know this claim that you have matches

00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,780
this piece of code and by the way

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,330
there's only been six versions

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,710
and here are the six versions that's the

00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,780
kind of thing that you could present to

00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,550
like a judge or something or whoever

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:45,030
saying you know this is this is what

00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,980
what's going on so so if some comments

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,740
on this you know they have the Python

00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,860
thing might be takeaway on this whole

00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:55,440
thing is that Python in some sense makes

00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,180
an impossible project like that possible

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,310
I mean it's like god I mean it's like a

00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,960
horrible work I mean not even being able

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,390
to ring your headphones into the vault

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,950
was just like torture I mean it's it's

00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,950
it's like you're in this vault coding

00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,720
it's like using Python you take this

00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,970
Impossible Project you kind of break it

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,100
down into something that's sane that you

00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,690
can actually do in like a reasonable

00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,310
amount of time it I mean it actually

00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,750
occurs to me that as an expert this was

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,460
probably the wrong approach I probably

00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:24,450
should have used notepad so I could

00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,790
charge like 4,000 hours of of work but

00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,990
no I mean Python really um really broke

00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,930
it down I would just add the

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:34,320
parenthetical comment that even Python 3

00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:37,710
makes it makes makes it the impossible

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,450
possible and so and so some final some

00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,090
final thoughts on this thing if you ever

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,890
get a chance to do something like this

00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:46,020
you're gonna learn a lot I'm not sure I

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,190
want to do it again you know there's a

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,660
lot of things like that where it's like

00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,770
yeah it's character-building but you

00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,740
don't want to don't want to go through

00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:55,830
it again but it you know it's sort of

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,800
interesting but but you might say well

00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,870
is he near the end this is how did this

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,590
thing and you know it's like I just like

00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:07,620
talked about this legal battle I don't

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:10,080
know this is the weird thing about some

00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,610
of these legal cases you might be called

00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,140
into it as an expert you might work on

00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,490
it for months and then all of a sudden

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,010
thing disappears and they just pack

00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,300
everything up and goes away it might

00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,350
have been settled it might have been

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,720
thrown out of court

00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,340
you know this case I do know some

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,920
details I know that they lost the case

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:29,130
initially I don't know that the exact

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,480
details of the judgment on that but but

00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,860
it is it's actually mysterious like

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,500
you're you're basically only privy to

00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,510
the like the technical part of the case

00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,710
you're not privy to things like like if

00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,060
they have a settlement or something

00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,850
you're not you don't know you don't know

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,200
how that went usually so so and even if

00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:47,010
I did know I couldn't tell you and

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,319
so but it sort of ends abruptly it's

00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:52,589
kind of a footnote on this getting near

00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:55,890
the end here my endgame on this is sort

00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:58,049
of curious but I learned a ton of stuff

00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:00,869
about generator functions using this

00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:03,450
doing this exercise because it was so

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:05,910
much data and I couldn't read it into

00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,650
RAM it's like when are we gonna I'm

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,359
gonna do this and I think it ultimately

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,160
was the background for this really

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,750
well-known generator tutorial if you've

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,710
encountered this online you wonder why

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,670
did Dave do that it it basically came

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,740
out of the vault

00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,089
figured y'all figurative actually

00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,460
nothing actually one cool thing about

00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:25,559
working in the vault is that all code

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,160
that was written in the vault stayed in

00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:28,140
the vault

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,150
I don't have to maintain it I don't have

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,730
to do bug reports it's like it's it's

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,890
guy it's like not my problem you know at

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,319
this point so it's you know state say

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:40,559
there one little one little PostScript

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,420
on this - if you get involved with one

00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,339
of these things you might actually go

00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,559
all the way to writing an expert report

00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:49,170
that gets used in like actual you know

00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,930
the court proceeding this is something

00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,400
that is actually really interesting that

00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,230
I'll mention just speaking as an

00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,630
academic so you know I used to be at the

00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,760
University I always had this this fear

00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,010
or thought that nobody ever read

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,420
anything that I wrote you know there's

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,220
number academics do you think - has

00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,970
anybody read what you write titus do you

00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,230
think they you take the fifth yeah yeah

00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,030
I mean there's always this fear like

00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,500
even for like my dissertation and grad

00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,440
school was like yeah I don't know did my

00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,329
adviser even read my dissertation so um

00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,520
so here's here's the thing if you write

00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:21,390
an expert report like if you do an

00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,000
expert witness you're gonna have to

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,710
write a report I can absolutely hundred

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,640
percent guarantee that it will be read

00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:31,470
and read at the level of each sentence

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,579
down to like things like commas and

00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,599
stuff they're gonna they're gonna take

00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,460
the other side we'll take it they're

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,680
gonna unleash like 10 perrolli like

00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,960
legal assistance on or like attorneys on

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,609
it they're gonna read it and then

00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,520
they're gonna haul you into a deposition

00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:47,730
which is usually you a bunch of

00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,290
attorneys a videographer they'll put

00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,119
like a huge can this is really cool it

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,980
get like the biggest video camera that

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,180
they can find right in this little tiny

00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,680
room and they'll shove it right in your

00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,440
face

00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,550
you know intimidate you and you'll sit

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,860
in there for eight hours and they're

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,900
gonna ask you about the report it is an

00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,850
awesome experience because you know

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,950
here's the thing that's awesome they

00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,560
have read the report and they're gonna

00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:11,030
discuss it in depth at every detail with

00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,400
you and it's going to be a big

00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:14,390
conversation about your report and they

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,970
are gonna they're going to try to

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:20,450
basically destroy you and so it is it is

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:23,840
a really awesome or horribly bad

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,250
experience the way it would be horribly

00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,720
bad as if you went in there and said

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,300
well I kind of looked at the patent for

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,860
like half an hour and it kind of looked

00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,470
similar you know that's how you would

00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:36,470
die basically and something like that

00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:37,940
so there's that tort court testimony I

00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,010
mentioned that I actually ended up going

00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,400
to court talking about concurrency or

00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:45,380
like what was that about it turns out it

00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,420
was related to this claim term

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,610
definition stuff there was a huge battle

00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,830
involving like concurrency and the judge

00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,870
was so sick of people battling about it

00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,880
he's like okay everybody come in you're

00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,590
gonna teach me about it and I ended up

00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,360
doing like a three-hour PowerPoint

00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:02,780
presentation on concurrent programming

00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,310
in like a courtroom the only thing that

00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,780
was different was sort of like this in a

00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,600
way except that the whole audience was

00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,790
attorneys and then and then the

00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,280
afterwards they had their own expert

00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,140
come up and then refute everything that

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,420
I just said for the previous three hours

00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,820
and then and then they we had like this

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,980
huge battle it was kind of kind of kind

00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,420
of entertaining there so so that's

00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,190
that's that's the end of the end of the

00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,620
talk we might have a time for I don't

00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,890
know a question a question or something

00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,890
like that

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,020
Larry so how long did you spend in the

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,180
vault and how long did you spend

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,599
specifically with your Python automation

00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,069
like developing it so most of this took

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,799
place I'm gonna I'm gonna say probably

00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:55,180
bout five months in the wall it started

00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:57,119
over the summer and it went for like

00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,869
five to six months

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:04,720
what was the second part of the question

00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:06,099
Oh on the automation I think that like

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,869
the automation part was probably the

00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,700
least I would say under a hundred hours

00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:12,099
on that the biggest thing the biggest

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:14,559
time sink of all was actually figuring

00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:16,059
out how the code worked I mean because

00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,440
it was like you had this massive like

00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:19,839
how would you figure out how a million

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,819
line C++ program works I mean it's a lot

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,380
of that was like pulling code fragments

00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,150
and building like three-ring notebooks

00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,770
of like things where you're like well

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,690
this talks to that and this talks to

00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,309
that and a lot of a lot of discussion

00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:33,280
with like attorneys involving claims

00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:34,780
like if you define this like this you're

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,280
gonna die and this is the reason why

00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,780
you're gonna die because like this code

00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,240
over here it doesn't do that that liked

00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:43,089
it that way so it's a lot of like behind

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,770
the scenes like like consultation of

00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:48,630
like how things work how the case is

00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:50,040
being framed and and so forth yeah

00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,740
question

00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,150
so had been lifting with just the search

00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,480
button you might have been dead in the

00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,339
water

00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,910
how did they feel about you using Python

00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:02,829
I don't think they knew I don't think

00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,299
they knew um well so it's like all this

00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:07,270
they had a question how did they did

00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:09,940
they know that we were using Python the

00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,130
so all that Python code was living on

00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,609
the vault and was first of all never

00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:18,819
printed so there was no printed record

00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:21,010
of anything coming up the case you know

00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,510
if if it had actually gone to trial it

00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,740
was fully expected that the code would

00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,930
have been produced probably it would

00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,309
have been part of the production but it

00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,930
but in this early stage of fact

00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:31,150
discovery I don't think they knew I

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,710
don't even think art like the side that

00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,089
I was working on knew what was going on

00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,069
they just knew that what Dave would go

00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:37,359
over to the vault like he would be there

00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:39,579
like David go to the vault for like a

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,770
day and he would sort of emerge out of

00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:43,240
the oh oh the other kind of weird thing

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,599
about this by the way the attorneys

00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,710
asked that I never communicate via email

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,329
this it's like the or this is like the

00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,549
the ultimate thing they like don't talk

00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,630
to us at all because I like if you're to

00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:54,670
working as an expert that

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,660
be produced later as evidence and

00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,160
they're just like well we don't really

00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,720
know what we want to do with you so just

00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,160
don't talk to us so it's kind of like

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,380
the ultimate work environment like you

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,240
have the client the client doesn't even

00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,680
want you to talk to that right so so

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,510
what you would do is you'd go over to

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,860
the young so you go over to the you go

00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,420
over to the vault and kind of work away

00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,920
and then you'd Matt they from their

00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,080
point of view Dave would magically

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,580
appear from the vault with this thing

00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,430
like hey why don't you ask for document

00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,840
FS 8 6 1 - b2 or something like that and

00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,330
they're like oh that's interesting and

00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:26,310
then yeah so there's a lot of thing a

00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:30,090
lot of things like that but thank you ok

00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,090
please thank David Beasley

00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,760
there's a halftime break downstairs I

00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:42,190
think things get started again in half

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,970
an hour or so look at your programs all

00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,970
