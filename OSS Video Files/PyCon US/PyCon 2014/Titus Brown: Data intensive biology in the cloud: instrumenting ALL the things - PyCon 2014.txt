Title: Titus Brown: Data intensive biology in the cloud: instrumenting ALL the things - PyCon 2014
Publication date: 2014-04-24
Playlist: PyCon 2014
Description: 
	Speaker: Titus Brown

"Cloud computing offers some great opportunities for science, but most cloud computing platforms are I/O and memory limited, and hence are poor matches for data-intensive computing. After 4 years of research software development we are now instrumenting and benchmarking our analysis pipelines; numbers, lessons learned, and future plans will be discussed. Everything is open source."
