A simple "Hello World!" page, served via Django, passes though a surprising number of layers & components. For a newcomer to the language or the platform, this can be overwhelming at the start. Here I'll take you on a drive through Django's request-response cycle, focusing on using its layered model to understand what's going on and get things done.
