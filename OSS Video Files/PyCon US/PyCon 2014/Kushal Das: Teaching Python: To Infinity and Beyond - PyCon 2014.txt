please welcome crucial talk is to

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,519
infinity and be teaching Python to

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,070
infinity and beyond I was a kid back

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,939
then in those days I still in love it

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,270
and I just want to say one few lines

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,809
about myself my name is Michelle does

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,980
I'm from India I'm a fedora contributor

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,140
a fellow member in PSF and I work as a

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,120
community gardener in a company called

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,640
eucalyptus systems so I should just

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,770
thank them once because they sponsored

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,260
my travel and staying and stuff and I

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,600
should thank Python also for sponsoring

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,680
my PyCon ticket through financial aid

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:07,979
and maybe I can start the real talk now

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:12,960
so this talk is actually about sharing

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:15,420
our experiences and things which worked

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,200
and which didn't work for our online

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:25,680
summer training we started this training

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:29,869
back in 2008 it's online it's it runs on

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,079
IRC it's runs for anyone who has a

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:38,729
comparatively new Linux distribution an

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:41,990
open mind to learn stuff and basically

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,040
whoever wants to become a contributor so

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,310
if you see that name

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,159
DGP l ug that's you can guess l ug is

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,060
Linux users group and DGP is the place

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,979
where I am from

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,030
draaga Pugh the nearest town from my

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,969
village and when this one I started that

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,149
luck back in 2004 and during that time

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,070
there was almost no one to tell us what

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,060
exactly to do with this thing called

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,209
Linux other than clicking randomly and

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,560
so the goal of our whole log was to

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,130
learn yourself and

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,780
teach others in Bengali like shake ho a

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,290
bum shake out I mean that's the

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,069
translation so that's how we started

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,410
doing our log and going out but then we

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,230
found that there are many engineering

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,450
colleges in that locality where we have

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,580
so many engineering college students who

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,190
are going to random companies to do

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,930
their summer training where basically

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,680
they are just paying for three months

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,630
some amount of money learning nothing at

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,150
the end of the three months just they're

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,830
just getting a certificate and they are

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,440
trying to use that certificate to get a

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,200
better job during college interviews in

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,650
the final year but almost zero

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,900
knowledge-sharing there so this training

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,299
started to actually have a replacement

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,180
for those kind of I should say nonsense

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,860
trainings where people generally go only

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,069
to build same library management system

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,720
year after year and because we already

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,150
started doing a lot of free software

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,120
work as a contributor in different parts

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,700
and different projects we thought that

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:28,739
we can actually share the whole thing as

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:31,549
a summer training program so from the

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,350
very first year our goal was always to

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,459
target the local people first and then

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,190
in a global level

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,190
so the initial idea was to go for

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,019
offline campaign as much as possible we

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,930
started with talking with the students

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,670
who we knew personally and then getting

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,769
their friends contacts from there like

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,139
in the same area or in other colleges

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,389
throughout India and when I say

00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,400
throughout India we started getting into

00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,370
the part of mailing lists so that we

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,590
announced it over mailing lists and then

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,730
it suddenly slowly started becoming

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:09,690
global effort at the beginning it was

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,910
only me but I'm going to name another

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,250
person here set the kernel he is not

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,950
here but he is a very well known federal

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,470
False developer and mentor from India so

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,780
he also teamed up with me to help out

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:26,550
the students and we set up the initial

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,510
part of the things to be done at any

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,930
minimum rate

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,940
and what all things we we think that we

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:38,970
can get out of this whole program how

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,430
things will grow and from there like I

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,470
mean he has a lot of Teatro these

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,810
tutorials online in his site which you

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,960
can just find his name Google you will

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,930
find those things and then came the next

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,660
step because during those days I never

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,310
heard the word MOOC as such and I never

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,560
knew I mean I only knew about the sites

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,540
where we can go and see some videos

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,660
online videos to learn about something

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,200
but which brings in through this problem

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,010
that why we chose IRC as our tool or

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,050
technology we never had good bandwidth

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,840
and when I still don't have good

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,030
bandwidth I am right now the fastest

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,310
internet connection of my life for Mbps

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,320
that is like and paying like hundred

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,060
dollars for it but I know most of the

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,980
students in India they don't have access

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,740
to any such Internet if they are lucky

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,560
they will get maybe 256 kbps if they are

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,490
in a big city they will get a 3G DS days

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,710
of course but iousy was something which

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,590
was part of free software community I

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:46,640
think from the very beginning it works

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,320
it just works takes very less bandwidth

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,350
we can actually record the stuff because

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,280
it's text and we can just keep the files

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,650
for the later reuse and I hope even in

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,540
the time of nuclear blasts and any other

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,100
kind of catastrophe is you will be still

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,170
there so that we can contact with each

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,580
other somehow

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:10,500
so without okay we'll try with IRC and

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:15,780
we did that offline and online campaign

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,860
in 2008 so first year we started around

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,390
10 students in the has DGP Luigi channel

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,370
by the though we are calling it a summer

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,670
training we actually start almost in the

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:31,260
rainy season in India like end of middle

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:34,410
of June that's the start timing so out

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,380
of 10 students I think the training ran

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:41,190
for three months so a little bit more on

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,070
the training is that this is a direct

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,980
talk i mean direct conversation I should

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,080
say between trainers and students so

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,390
trainers will start talking in the IRC

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,520
channel and it will go on till many

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,460
hours sometimes like six hours and till

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,710
2 a.m. in the night for the students we

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,140
do sessions almost every day night other

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,600
than weekends for first two months and

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,780
then one month and or one and a half

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,140
month project works where we try to push

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,940
the same people into upstream places so

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,680
out of 10 students we got lay around

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,590
three or four students who stayed with

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,620
us later they went into different other

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,910
projects and that was the first year so

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:27,150
we started doing this year after year

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:33,680
2014 will be seventh year for us so last

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:37,110
year we started with 80 students from

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,660
very different backgrounds when I

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,590
started this the goal was engineering

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,050
students but I can give you an idea like

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,390
what kind of people we got not only from

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,760
India from this side of the world like

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:56,240
North America all across here of

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:58,890
Afghanistan Sri Lanka Bangladesh and

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,680
people came people talked with us many

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,500
people stayed like out of 80 students

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,990
here almost 40 plus state till the three

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,620
months training course they came online

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,600
almost every day on time and kept doing

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,300
I mean they kept doing the stuff which

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,340
was required

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,919
so other than engineers we had a

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,919
musician was like doing masters in music

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,870
and wanted to learn Python and now as

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,650
far as I know that he is moving from

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:31,560
Spain to Oxford and along his his music

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,039
master's degree he's he became a half

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,560
part-time Django developer we got from

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,630
Sweden I think we got a primary school

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,460
English teacher who was a full time

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,770
primary school teacher from there he

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,110
moved into half time or part-time and

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,540
other part-time as a sysadmin and Python

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,700
developer and fusee said means from

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,140
Germany who became full-time developers

00:08:50,700 --> 00:09:00,240
just a move of the carrier

00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:02,800
and regular Indian college students like

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,620
we had friends correct we started this

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,420
program based on our friends we try to

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,190
talk with to them we try to talk to

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,060
their friends and get students into this

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:15,040
project and we never thought about the

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,910
word which I am hearing in the last few

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,280
years a lot of time the word is

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:25,000
diversity we never actually thought

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:29,950
about that why from the very beginning

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,690
we had ever 50% Roman participation so

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,900
even in last year out of 80 plus

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,720
students we had almost 42 or 43 women

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,360
participating in this program we never

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,700
had a problem where it was like the too

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,310
many boys or it is like too many men

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,670
centric program or anything or it it was

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:52,060
always almost in the similar level at

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:56,050
from the very beginning and we also made

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,870
sure that the message goes out in a

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,110
proper way to the different colleges so

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,670
of just after the first year when we got

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,480
few people who are doing good

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,150
both men and women we actually tried to

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,120
push them up in the local community as

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,130
local superheroes so they went to their

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,800
colleges to their friends and shared

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,560
their own knowledge and their life story

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,350
that how they started from zero and they

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,190
become something and which keep bringing

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:31,870
in more and more students from both men

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:35,170
and women like the diversity part few

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,870
times we saw like and because it's

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,360
online sessions you know people speak

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,490
many random things sometimes the

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,370
trainers and few of us who do regular

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,970
sessions we become kind of itchy and we

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:51,730
use lot of sarcasm maybe but it goes

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:55,110
well in both cases there is no like if

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,110
you are a student you are just a student

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,960
one more thing which worked really well

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,760
was staying in touch so we are not a

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,370
kind of program where it just runs

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,950
for three months and it's over instead

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,200
those students become our friends they

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,410
stay online in the same place again and

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,790
again year after year we mix which we

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,680
try to guide them throughout their

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,870
college level and even in their career

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,150
level when like which companies to join

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:30,850
where to work on like what kind of

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:33,180
projects we can work in future the

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,280
difference is actually to think that

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,340
when when someone new is coming in they

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,020
might think that oh that's it's a huge

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,630
community I just want to go and learn

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,700
something we want to break that part or

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,950
we want to make sure that they learn

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,800
that they are the community they are

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,600
part of this we if we have to grow we

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,330
have to grow all together and this

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,190
message only stays if we make sure that

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,710
people are coming back people are

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:08,530
staying in touch and we repeat the same

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:11,860
exercise year after year a little bit on

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,420
the course outline what we teach

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,120
starting from communication guidelines

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,530
mailing list guidelines what is IRC what

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,980
our mailing list how you should talk

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,690
work when to talk from there to basics

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,080
of Linux distributions terminals

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:29,590
commands you have to learn source code

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,740
management systems a lot of streaming

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:35,140
time goes into documentation why

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,380
documentation is necessary making sure

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,670
everything everyone learns about

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,220
documentation first even before they

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,050
start writing any code and we try to

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,640
push it so hard so that it becomes their

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,550
natural habit to write good

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:52,270
documentation and we are getting kind of

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,010
good result out there and the final part

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,960
of the training is actually taking those

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,270
individual students and making them a

00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,090
contributor to some upstream project it

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:07,180
can be anything al coming to the

00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:09,220
projects a little bit later so whatever

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,950
happens in the last few years seven

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,990
years six years the logs are there in

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,940
that URL if you go you will find the

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:20,529
class session logs this thing helps to

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,899
revisit the whatever we did

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,329
for you will find many fancy funny

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,060
things on the essence kind of questions

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:36,339
people ask so you may want to just go

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:39,279
and visit it later on and in any kind of

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,889
sessions we always say that you should

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,660
start from the scratch do not assume

00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,509
that your students are the people who

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,059
are here they know this thing or that

00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,490
thing in technology they maybe are

00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:53,170
coming from a complete different world

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,589
nothing to do with technology they just

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,230
want to learn it so the class should

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:01,059
progress based on the speed of the

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,699
slowest student not on the people who

00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:07,920
can just learn everything every day so

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,920
we try to pace the class based on that

00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:13,660
this brings in some funny stories like

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,990
lessons learned you can say in one way

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,269
like so during the command-line tools

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:23,769
and training spot we try to teach people

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:25,629
how to do the basic level of building C

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,059
programs or libraries and what is build

00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:32,410
dependency what is make all the basic

00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:35,970
things and one of the says and we

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,170
generally say install Fedora by default

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,329
but if you are coming with another

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,220
distribution say Debian or Ubuntu will

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,529
still help you we will tell you what is

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,559
the exact command to use to get the

00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:50,589
things done so the default answer for

00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:53,889
installing our GCC package was CM

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,990
install GCC everyone said it worked it

00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,879
worked it worked and suddenly one

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,699
student came up is like it's not working

00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,680
it's not working for almost half an hour

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,679
like three or four of us were trying to

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,629
help him out and after all the commands

00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,879
we actually knew to figure out what's

00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:12,250
wrong with the M in that box somebody

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:15,509
actually asked him oh by the way which

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:21,069
distribution you are in oh I mean Ubuntu

00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:23,499
alright okay so how you got the yum in

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,110
the first place I said you people were

00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:29,949
telling everyone to do um so I did just

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,510
did apt-get install yum why can't you

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:34,520
two just apt-get install GCC instead

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,040
but yeah that's a part of the whole

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,840
process so we assume that the student

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,380
knows the difference between where to

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,690
use them or where to use GCC wrong

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,150
assumption so these days we just think

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,070
that everyone knows nothing and let's

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,410
start from the scratch people who can

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,210
pick a first they will pick up first but

00:15:51,410 --> 00:16:00,500
we'll paste the program based on all

00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:03,140
students okay how to manage 50 plus

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,780
students on an IRC channel this is

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,170
something was not we discovered we just

00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,540
reused the process we we have in Fedora

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,340
project so federal project has this

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,950
meeting rooms federal - meeting federal

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,320
- meeting - one where we get many people

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,330
at the same time and the idea is the

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,750
person who is speaking the mint or

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,670
person who is in chair he or she will be

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,200
keep talking and the other people if

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,510
they have any questions they will just

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,280
type the exclamation mark then the

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,770
moderator and the person who is in chair

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,750
in our case our trainers they will see

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,970
those exclamation marks and they will

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,760
allow people or ask people to speak up

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,430
and the students will end with a eom or

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,370
your eft message so that we know that he

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,560
is done we can answer it back and along

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,390
with 80-plus students it worked really

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,490
well

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,220
there was never ever any problem where

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,750
like following the rules but we had to

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,730
make sure that the rule is being

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:04,820
followed strictly if not we just out

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:07,160
back with caps so as I said let wheat

00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,250
when it comes about programming and

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,959
doing stuff new people coming up a lot

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:17,959
with this problem indentation issues so

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,820
don't try to solve it there just teach

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,680
them some beta redditors it can be any

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,079
editor it can be just ipython notebook

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,230
that will solve the new people's

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:34,160
indentation issue totally they will not

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:36,800
have that problem at all solve real-life

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,810
problems during the initial project days

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,020
we ask the students to solve problems

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,910
which are very near to them instead the

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,530
problems like any mathematical quiz or

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,340
any other problems which we think is

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,070
good

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,740
so with the last few years we saw people

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,690
solving or creating programs - like

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,410
downloading subtitles for the movies

00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,500
they have or one student actually wrote

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,480
a code to scrap through all his movie

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,170
selection getting all the metadata from

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,510
IMDB and so kissing in a nice UI people

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,290
are writing note-taking applications

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,180
system monitoring tool compiling C

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,430
programs from Windows to a Linux box

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,040
server somewhere else through some

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,750
simple Python scripts stuff like that so

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,140
things which are very near to the

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,630
students and we believe that's the only

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,940
way students will love the problem

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,620
statements or else it will be just some

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,980
problem which is given by the teacher to

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:36,320
solve but in this way they will find oh

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,660
this is something can help me - or my

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,100
friends - and they can write it and they

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:46,580
can actually show it off to their

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:49,330
students other friends students one big

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,910
thing in our program superheroes so

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,810
first the superheroes are the other

00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,660
contributors who are doing great things

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,910
for us for a long time so we call those

00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,160
special sessions as guest sessions or

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:04,280
guest lectures where people from

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,080
upstream development or any kind of

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,320
upstream projects come over and give

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,750
talks most of the talks are on in

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,030
general like how they started their life

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,120
from zero knowledge to where they are

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,900
now there are talks on say Creative

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,170
Commons license

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,620
documentation licensing in general last

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,940
year and Nick Coughlin started the talks

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,460
when his talk was the first guest

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,720
lecture session this year hopefully many

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,720
of the other pythonista

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,120
will come over and give sessions like

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:40,460
this this actually helps the students to

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,590
stay in touch or to see that that person

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,750
I know that name who wrote all these

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,540
applications is actually real person I

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,390
can talk to him or her and I can ask

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,640
anything so that gives them a much more

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,860
confidence so we try to sell them that

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,940
give them hope keep them heroes so that

00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,540
they can follow and they can become

00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,540
better hero

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,720
we have a small home task submission

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:11,270
system which is written in Python I will

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,280
pass the link later on so from all these

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,880
trainings what I found people who are

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,320
contributing to projects like Fedora KD

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,850
OpenStreetMap people who are in

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,650
companies like Red Hat Amazon Yahoo the

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,590
new startups coming up and all across

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:31,820
the Indian IT service companies they got

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:33,140
picked up very fast which was kind of

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:38,900
our goal to actually get these

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:41,750
contributors up and running basically

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,770
those are the things I think I wanted to

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,150
talk about and here are a few pictures

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,740
during the questions I just want to take

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,210
some questions if there these are a few

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,220
students from the different training

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,980
sessions who just sent in their pictures

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:58,280
just before this PyCon so that we can

00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:01,040
just project it there so we will find

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:05,180
like this guy he started as a translator

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,500
it just moved too fast but and from

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,390
there I think he is doing a lot of

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,740
OpenStack documentation work I think he

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,210
was the second-highest committer in the

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,130
documentation something like similar a

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:18,260
few months back so so just like that we

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,890
we do have sometimes questions if

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,890
anybody's got one

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:38,900
one can you expand the a e-o m0f

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:40,850
shortcuts from IRC oh that's not a

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,310
shortcut actually just typed the angular

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,020
brackets and type UF just so that we can

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:48,470
understand the message is over but

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:52,400
message is over and the second is end of

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:55,190
something F Oh like you can type either

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,400
of that end of message end of file okay

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,230
like that you said that you have

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,150
students come in with problems that they

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,860
want to solve do you you actually

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,450
require that as part of it or because we

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,920
tried to do that before with educational

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,980
efforts where you want people come in

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,900
with a project not mine or actually no

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,360
because not everyone can come up with

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,950
ideas it will be like out of 40 maybe

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,500
five or six will come up with their own

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,200
ideas for rest of them we have something

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,970
little bit similar kind of things but we

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,910
try to push them like what you like like

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,740
spend 15 days films for 20 days and find

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,300
out what kind of problems you have in

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,730
your daily life we try to talk a lot

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,620
over IRC yeah that make sense because we

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,820
had to say proud not a not everybody's

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,250
gonna come up with an idea and that was

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:44,390
always kind of a a challenge yeah it's

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:47,240
always a big challenge high kind of high

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,590
turned into that arm when you come up

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,400
with the challenges and they were coming

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:54,140
up with the challenges did you find that

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,430
with conceptual like all the computer

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,110
science and conceptual things they need

00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,660
to learn did you find that they were

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,340
going to miss some gap so that all or

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,740
the problems that end up covering all

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,410
the gaps of course they're going to be

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,870
some gaps so during the sessions what we

00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:11,180
also do is to pass them different book

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,950
names which we think can give them some

00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,110
basic ideas say about operating systems

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,960
say about data structures what are these

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,790
things time to time and we try to push

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,040
them to other like whatever video

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:25,070
lectures we find which are useful things

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,660
like that because only maybe I mean not

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,870
everyone can actually learn those things

00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,510
while only solving problems but still

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,120
real life's problems is like we'll give

00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,470
them a chance to learn things for

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,580
example if you are writing a program

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,549
which

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,840
small game maybe like number guessing or

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,999
something which you want to give it to

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,739
your friend next so you have to learn

00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,119
about packaging that how to package that

00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,159
thing so that you can actually give it

00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,389
back across to your friend so you have

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,100
to do that and learn something out of it

00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:57,379
okay I actually have a little question

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,989
one of the things that comes up somewhat

00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:02,779
frequently is people who kind of want to

00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:05,690
jump into open-source but don't

00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:07,369
necessarily know what project to do do

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,619
you have advice that you can give to the

00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:11,600
people yes doing your things yes how do

00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:13,009
you go about that so what we do is we

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,960
actually try to keep a track of the

00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:16,999
students how they're performing what are

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,559
the kind of things they like because we

00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:20,419
not only talk about programming and

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,190
computer we talk about natural things

00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,960
well I mean normal things what they do

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,090
in daily life kind of things try to

00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,799
become friends to them so that we can

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,239
identify the points like with kind of

00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,549
things they like do they like to use

00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:33,169
genome or KD or do you like use Connect

00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:35,570
ad so you may want to may not learn

00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,100
little bit of C++ here are the few links

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,989
which you can study this if you have a

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,940
problem here are the people in our group

00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:44,269
who can help you with the C++ stuff and

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,480
from there slowly stepping up because

00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:49,009
otherwise it's a problem to identify

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,649
that thing because that's the question

00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:53,480
every time it comes up so a sceptic

00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:56,480
unknown if you search his name he has

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,129
one of the documents called I want to do

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,619
a project what should I do now or

00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:02,359
something so he actually explained it in

00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:04,489
that completely that if you want to do a

00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:07,369
project what are the steps just follow

00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:08,090
it up there well if there's no more

00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:12,070
questions

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,070
