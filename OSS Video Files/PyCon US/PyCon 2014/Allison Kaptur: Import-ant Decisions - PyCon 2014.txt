Title: Allison Kaptur: Import-ant Decisions - PyCon 2014
Publication date: 2014-04-24
Playlist: PyCon 2014
Description: 
	Speaker: Allison Kaptur

Suppose `import` didn't exist, and we had to invent it from scratch. We'll look at the problem - code sharing and reuse across modules - and different ways we could solve it. We'll come up with `import` from parallel universes and then reinvent python's actual implementation. Finally, we'll import - using python's design - without using the `import` keyword.
