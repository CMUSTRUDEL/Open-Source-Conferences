Description: 
	Speakers: Kate Heddleston, Nicole Zuckerman

This is a talk about how to make junior and new engineers into independent and productive members of your engineering team faster and cheaper. We will focus on python specific resources and libraries that will help you create a simple but effective on boarding program, and talk about case studies of companies that have had success using these techniques.

pleasure to introduce Kate hiddleston

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,589
and Nicole Zukerman who are going to

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,110
talk to you about technical onboarding

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:20,939
training and mentoring please a big big

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:23,699
round of applause hey everybody welcome

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,390
to our talk so how is pikkon been for

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,750
everyone good yeah it's like a roller

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,250
coaster so we're going to talk to you

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,380
today about technical onboarding

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,180
training and mentoring my name is Kate

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,510
Huddleston I'm a software engineer I

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,670
live in San Francisco California I'm

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,590
Nicole zukerman I'm the picture that's

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,829
not her I'm a software engineer at

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,170
eventbrite I'm also a graduate from hack

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,899
bright Academy and I was a first junior

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,149
engineer of that ilk to join eventbrite

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,530
and I've been helping on helping

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,710
increasingly with onboarding each

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,879
successive new junior engineer to join

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,199
yeah so the reason that Nicole and I

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,719
submitted this talk in the first place

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,450
is we both had very separate experiences

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,950
at different companies where we joined

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,200
the company we worked there for a while

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,270
we reached a certain proficiency at

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,260
programming and we looked back on our

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,909
time and we were like we could have

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,590
gotten here much faster if there had

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,299
been any sort of onboarding at all and

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,310
so we turned around and created programs

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,159
at our respective companies to help new

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,140
engineers get up to speed and so we came

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,390
together and submitted this talk so what

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,299
is on boarding for the purposes of this

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,009
talk onboarding is the process of taking

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,229
someone from outside of a team and

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,960
bringing them in and making them a happy

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,000
productive and independent member of the

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,530
team so today we're specifically going

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,740
to be talking about onboarding junior

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,570
engineers but a lot of the things that

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,439
we do mention today are useful for

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,240
people of all different skill levels all

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,740
right why do you care i'm going to give

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,450
you four major reasons why you should

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,189
care about onboarding i assume that

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,259
everyone here probably does already care

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,280
since you came to this talk but i want

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,899
to convince you that onboarding is

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,450
important not just in general but it's

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,380
important now so the four things that

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm going to talk about are the

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,770
productivity of the individual the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
productivity of the company the

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,510
productivity of the team and bonus

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,550
diverse

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,470
alright the productivity of the

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,820
individual so this is a category that

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,440
most people think about building the

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,420
skills of the new engineer getting them

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,860
up to speed on your tools there's

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,020
another category in this which is their

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,450
confidence and happiness a lot of people

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,520
think that confidence follow skills when

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,860
in fact skills often follow confidence

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,390
confident people are outgoing they're

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,360
excited to learn new things they reach

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,160
outside they're bound so onboarding is

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,110
really great for increasing both the

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,230
confidence and skill set of new

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,060
engineers the productivity of the

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,160
company companies care about money as

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,440
they should and so on boarding is great

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,150
for the bottom line more productive

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,310
engineers make you more money and that's

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,850
great and everyone's happy because the

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,710
company is making more money the

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,600
productivity of the team this is really

00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,280
important because as you add new

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,960
engineers to a team the team

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,110
fundamentally changes with each new

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,730
person there's a lot of things about how

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,890
you don't really know something unless

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,260
you teach it and this is absolutely true

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,060
for company culture and process if you

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,340
can't explain your company culture to a

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,860
new engineer and you can't explain your

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,900
process for shipping code then you don't

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,610
know it yourself and so every time you

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,860
add a new engineer you should reiterate

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,020
this both to the new person and also to

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,030
the existing team so you have something

00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,040
a little bit more like this and as your

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,680
team grows this becomes increasingly

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,300
important for example at LinkedIn at a

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,250
certain point every new engineer they

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,770
added was decreasing their productivity

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,600
so the new SVP of engineering had to

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,550
come in and revamp everything so that

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,230
adding new engineers didn't decrease the

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,940
over overall productivity of the team so

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,970
this is one of my favorite equations

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,520
that I have ever made up I used to coach

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,550
high school JV water polo when I was in

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,110
college and it's like 14 and 15 year old

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,790
girls they're beginners at water polo

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,800
and I'd have these really philosophical

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,780
team meetings you know I come in with

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,430
like posters and so I come in with this

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,950
one day and I was trying to explain to

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,140
them the importance of teamwork and I

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,900
told them your guys ability to win as a

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,359
team is the sum of your skills and

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,970
talents x your ability to work together

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,830
as a team and this means that you all

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,660
can be less skilled or more mediocre

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,820
water player water polo players

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,320
work together incredibly well and you

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,240
can beat teams of people who are

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,070
theoretically more skilled or more

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,110
talented but don't work together as well

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,730
and you can see this in engineering

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,640
teams this is absolutely true no matter

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,200
what the type of team is there's a lot

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,600
of really big products out there like

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,790
Gmail was is one of them that were built

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,290
by teams of less than 10 people some

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,940
even built by the teams of less than 5

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,890
people so a small team can be highly

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,490
productive especially if they work

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,280
together really well all right a bonus

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,160
category diversity how many of you have

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,920
read the dr. Seuss book about the

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,450
Sneetches anyone okay that's pretty good

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:12,030
so it's um to children's poem about kind

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,650
of this society where some some

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,480
sneetches have stars on their bellies

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,010
and other Sneetches don't and spout the

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,290
division that happens within the

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,420
sneetches because of the stars on some

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,400
bellies and and the non stars another so

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,430
i used Sneetches to represent diversity

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,370
diversity can mean many different things

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,230
so this happens a lot in tech what you

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,730
have is a homogeneous group and they

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,530
bring into the fold other people who are

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,990
like themselves and they have no

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,510
onboarding and this works because the

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,190
new person is a lot like the people who

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,410
are already on the team they probably

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,880
communicate in similar ways they

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,280
probably have similar hobbies and

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,780
interests so getting up to speed on all

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,820
of the social practices within the

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,950
company is easier for this person they

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,060
need less onboarding and it gives them

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,300
an advantage that they're like the

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,980
existing group however if you would like

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,560
to hire people who are different than

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,820
the team you already have you don't want

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,410
something like this to happen you don't

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,390
want people to feel like they are

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,020
outside the group and so having explicit

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,100
onboarding can help with this enormously

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,110
having a way to bring people up to speed

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,300
both on social practices and team

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,490
culture in a way that doesn't rely on

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,550
the existing social structure is good

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,200
for diversity and if you are not sold on

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,120
hiring people who are different from the

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,850
team you already have feel free to come

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:32,580
talk to me afterwards all right who

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,890
should on board this is either a picture

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,169
of a bunch of ants carrying some food or

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,120
a bunch of people carrying a boat it's

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,800
open to interpretation but the idea is

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,550
you should spread out the load you don't

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,310
want to burn out

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,500
morning mentors actually a lot of people

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,940
on the team can mentor and onboard

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,080
people in different areas it doesn't

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,020
always have to be someone who is

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,580
incredibly senior yeah at eventbrite I

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,650
was paired up with someone who was

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,820
really skilled and talented when I was

00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,640
trying to set up my dev environment

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,440
initially and for all his skills and

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,720
talents he hadn't recently set his

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,940
environment up so he didn't know you

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,280
know the recent foibles and little bugs

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,870
that were in the system that say the

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,500
most recent person to set up their

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,870
system did so in the end I found someone

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,370
who had done it more recently and he was

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,130
a great help to me in setting up my

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,950
environment so this is another great way

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,990
to get more people involved just right

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,410
away in someone's integration into a

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,940
team all right how should you think

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,620
about onboarding at a conceptual level

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,240
you want to maximize your return on

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,040
investment I think this makes sense to

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,230
everyone no one wants to put in more

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,460
than they get out of something this is a

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,620
really common in efficient way to

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,620
onboard that I see a lot where new

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,300
onboarding mentors are like I'm going to

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,260
be the best onboarding mentor ever and

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,640
we're going to do everything together

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,200
and we're going to take all of these

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,460
coding classes and by the end of three

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,220
months this person is going to know

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,840
everything that I know and that's wildly

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,910
unrealistic and also leads to a lot of

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,560
burnout and then companies are like we

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,200
can't support any more junior engineers

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,870
it's just too much work for everyone so

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,220
instead of doing something like this I

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,960
think bumper bowling is a better analogy

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,660
which is it's also the only way that I

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,600
should ever bowl set up a world where

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,550
the junior engineer can play freely and

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,110
make mistakes and you don't have to

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,550
handhold them through the process of

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,380
getting up to speed on things or

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,210
learning new technologies you can really

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,830
kind of leave them check in periodically

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,440
and make sure that they're roughly on

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,690
the right chat track but they have the

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,600
freedom to explore and grow without

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,900
burning out onboarding mentors at

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,160
eventbrite I feel much more comfortable

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,960
writing code and breaking things with

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,670
impunity when I know it's a well-tested

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,050
area of the code base so that I know

00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,160
that I'm not going to push anything

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,950
that's going to break anything in

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,320
production and give me a panic attack

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,610
yeah so from a technical perspective

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,230
having a lot of automation around your

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,790
development environments and deploy is

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,670
really useful for hiring junior

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,170
engineers you can create places where

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,910
they can go and play and

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,230
I have to worry about it it's also

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,630
important to note that one of the

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,880
tenants of expertise is the ability to

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,620
set boundaries and scope in order to

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,440
scope you have to understand the domain

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,269
space incredibly well and so junior

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,649
engineers by definition are not good at

00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:12,480
scoping and are not good at setting

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,190
boundaries because how could they be and

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
so one of the things to think about is

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,579
setting these boundaries for junior

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,050
engineers making sure that they have

00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,920
this world where they understand where

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,180
they are and what they're doing so there

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,260
are three major categories to think

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,360
about when you think about how to

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,430
onboard a junior engineer the first is

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,410
technical knowledge normally people

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,269
focus most of their attention on

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,430
technical knowledge like ninety percent

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,779
of it I think it's only roughly a third

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,760
of what you need to get someone up to

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,410
speed on another third is the company

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,180
knowledge and process how do you ship

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,459
code how do you decide what features get

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,230
built who is in charge of things and

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,720
then the third the third category is

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,459
personal development so like I said that

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,199
confidence and that upward trajectory

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,329
where someone feels like they are

00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:56,279
independent and progressing is hugely

00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,170
important not to mention the fact that

00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,279
if someone feels like they are going

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,750
somewhere in a company they're more

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,420
likely to stick around so now you've

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,920
hired a new junior engineer how do you

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,420
get this started really onboarding

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,910
should probably start from the moment

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,490
they accept your offer but for our

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,870
purposes we're going to define

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,940
onboarding as the process of getting

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,430
someone up to speed until they can be

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,959
reliably independent you can they can

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,519
ask questions but you can send them off

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,230
with a project and know that they'll be

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,470
able to get it done without just

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,660
floundering around so there's really a

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,160
critical first week and probably it'll

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,510
take at least three months for any

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,640
engineer to get up to speed we're

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,199
positing that probably six months or a

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,459
year is a better estimate for junior

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:43,410
people so we call this week one its

00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,480
really arbitrary chunk of time number

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,630
one this is the things that you should

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,300
get started as soon as possible like a

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,459
dev environment as i mentioned budding

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,649
them up with the most recent person who

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,329
set up their system this is an

00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,750
opportunity to get multiple people

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:03,120
invested in their trajectory introduce

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,279
mentors and make those mentors people

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,970
who can be non-judgmental as well as a

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,410
technical resource you also want to

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,569
show them where you keep technical

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,459
resources let's say a book that you

00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:16,079
consider at your company to be the

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,120
definitive way that you do django at

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,560
your company point them to where they

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,149
can find that resource so they don't

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,870
have to flatter around and find it

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:27,389
themselves or not one thing that's

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,579
really handy is if they journal or blog

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,740
and keep three things per day or per

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:34,019
week that they've learned or three

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,519
things that they didn't understand they

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,649
can do this for themselves but it's also

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,709
useful for them to be able to touch base

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:43,500
with their manager or mentor regularly

00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:45,420
and discuss these things one thing that

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,149
I do at eventbrite and I still have it

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,529
right now is a document called things

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,360
I've learned and this is literally a

00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:53,879
google doc that's 50 pages long at this

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,730
point and contains things like commands

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,290
that I seldom need to run but don't want

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,009
to have to look up every time in our

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:06,870
documentation like for example how do i

00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:09,269
update our we run scons we make sure

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,550
that our CSS and everything is up to

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,819
date do I need to be inside my

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,500
environment or outside so this is a

00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,809
place for me to keep information like

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,829
that and also just things that I've

00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,839
learned that I want to make sure i

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,490
return retain but I know I won't

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,089
remember all the information the first

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,230
time I hear it it'd be great if you can

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,629
get them to ship code in their first

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,000
week but make sure that this is a very

00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:34,620
small piece that's not very technically

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,240
complex this is really just an

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,490
opportunity for them to learn your

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,990
process around shipping code and not so

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,910
much about the technical challenges of

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,100
being an engineer I think this is Kate's

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,629
favorite slide have a social event if

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,779
you can so that they feel like they are

00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:54,569
part of the team the more likely the

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,220
more they feel like they're socially

00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:58,019
integrated with them the more likely

00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,399
they are to ask questions and you

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,759
definitely want your junior engineer to

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,199
be able to ask questions so this brings

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:09,689
us to arbitrary chunk of time number two

00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:11,819
we suggest that you introduce them to

00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,430
the history of the company and any

00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:16,680
coding philosophies at this point rather

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,420
than let's say day one when their brains

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,160
are already overloaded and they can't

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,540
possibly remember it this is still

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,410
useful information for them to have

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,569
though

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,480
so give it to them an arbitrary trunk of

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:28,920
time period to one thing that I really

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,190
wish I'd had when i started at

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,769
eventbrite was a team map someone either

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,589
a holding a piece of paper or a document

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:40,680
available online to say this is Alice

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:42,839
she's great with automation this is Bob

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,550
he's great at things that begin with be

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,009
so you should ask him questions about

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,720
that and make sure that this is a

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,490
permanent resource that they can find I

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,500
know that people move around desks and

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,310
everything but even if they just have

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,649
Alice automation Bob be related things

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,639
that's really handy especially when it

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,019
comes time to ask questions probably my

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,850
favorite part of my onboarding

00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,250
experience at eventbrite was the

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,170
introduction of code labs this is an

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,199
opportunity maybe two or three times a

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,060
week for an hour for a junior engineer

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,519
or however many junior engineers you

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,550
have to sit in a room with a senior

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,829
person and ask in a totally safe space

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,660
whatever questions they can think of no

00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,220
matter how stupid and it really does

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,959
need to be a safe place to ask those

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,569
questions otherwise they're likely to

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,430
just button up and not bother when you

00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,040
do this though make sure that the senior

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,540
engineer is the kind who can do so

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,329
without judgement and is good at

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,230
explaining things that's a really

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:45,329
important facet of this questions that

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,990
your engineer is likely to ask in this

00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:51,899
can be things like what is rabbit how

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,149
does the Django ORM work what is celery

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,040
or even something like I have this bug

00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,160
in my code and I can't figure out what's

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,380
going on can you walk through it with me

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,959
it's important to ascertain where their

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,430
knowledge begins and ends so in this

00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,079
feel free to ask them follow-up

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,730
questions to make sure that you're

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,819
starting at a place that's useful for

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,740
them and this is another opportunity to

00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:15,660
get more people invested in a junior

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,579
engineers development because it doesn't

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,470
have to be the same engineer who's in

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,509
the room with them every time you can

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,579
have someone front end on Mondays for

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,279
questions about JavaScript you can have

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:28,500
someone on Wednesdays whose full stack

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,430
who can follow the Django request cycle

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,709
throughout and maybe friday is a guest

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,329
star every week or something like that

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,220
so this is

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:40,860
opportunity to spread the love and get

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,829
your team invested another thing that's

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,809
a great tool is shadowing either an hour

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,999
a day or maybe a couple of hours a week

00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:50,189
for a junior engineer to sit with a

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,739
senior engineer and listen to their

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:54,809
thought process so the senior engineer

00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:55,889
will say okay so now i'm importing this

00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,569
thing because we're going to need it

00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,850
here and then i was thinking about

00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:01,769
structuring it this way and this is an

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,509
opportunity for the junior engineer to

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,399
sort of get a sense for thought

00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,769
processes and the way that you develop

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,029
code and your code style rather than

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,799
getting sort of bogged down in the

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,799
details about where that semicolon goes

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,839
so this brings us to arbitrary chunk of

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,059
time number three we suggest that you

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,329
introduce one-on-ones at least by now if

00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:26,100
you haven't already this is a once a

00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:29,519
week probably 30 minute chunk of time

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,879
where you can set aside to talk manager

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,369
to engineer about roadblocks or check in

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,850
about anything that the engineer has on

00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:40,619
their mind and one thing that we've

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,829
introduced for later engineers who have

00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:46,290
started after me is the idea of

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:48,569
five-minute presentations so a senior

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,589
person or our manager approaches the

00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:54,389
junior engineer and says here you should

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,389
check out bloom filters why don't you go

00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,980
research that and come back to me in a

00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,529
week and tell me what you've learned as

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,449
you guys have probably figured out by

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:05,699
now it probably it doesn't really hurt

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:08,579
to have experience in doing presenting

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,589
early and often it's a really good skill

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,010
to develop and probably one we should

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,279
all start sooner and if the manager

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,049
supplies the topic of conversation like

00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:20,639
decorators or generators that they know

00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,409
that is going to be really useful for

00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,539
the junior engineer this helps them also

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:28,939
hone their research skills which as we

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,939
all know is also really important and

00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:35,580
murderer as Kate mentioned we learn

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:39,659
through teaching so this will help them

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:42,960
keep things in their brains so goal

00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:45,899
setting is also really important this is

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,970
a junior engineer and their manager

00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:50,160
probably sitting down and talking about

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,050
where each of them except

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,780
the junior engineer to be in a month or

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,670
three months or six months so if I say

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,960
that I'm really interested in pursuing

00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:03,060
data and my manager was expecting that I

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,550
would turn into a front-end engineer

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,290
there's probably a mismatch there and we

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,240
need to figure out how to make both of

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,180
us happy and this is a great opportunity

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,280
for someone who's more senior to help

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,390
set up some intermediate steps to get

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,850
them there for example a short-term goal

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,770
can be you should be able to find and

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,080
fix a bug based on a century error or

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,930
comment meaningfully on someone else's

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,220
code and then once the junior engineer

00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,320
has achieved this they'll have a sense

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,700
of accomplishment they'll feel like

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,620
they're really getting someplace they'll

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:40,170
be confident when they do further

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,730
endeavors so it's also really important

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,680
to give engineers feedback on those

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,170
goals and on projects that they receive

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,820
I think a pitfall of engineering is that

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,560
often we say well you could have done

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,060
this better or here's a way that you can

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,700
improve which is really useful

00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,950
information but equally useful is you

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,350
did this really well keep that up that's

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,900
an equally good guideposts for learning

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,310
and will help them continue to feel like

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,440
they are not a total failure in

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,720
engineering and reinforce their impostor

00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,630
syndrome which probably a lot of them

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:17,420
have so arbitrary chunk of time period

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:19,470
for one thing that I do periodically is

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:23,460
review concepts that I learned

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:26,640
previously in code lab for example I'll

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,480
say okay so here's what I remember about

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,130
a response and I'll go through a couple

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,780
of minutes of saying everything that I

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,410
remember from the last time we talked

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,330
about it and then my buddy my mentor my

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,520
senior engineer can say yeah that's

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,200
really good this chunk that you missed

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,180
is also really important so make sure

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,730
that you keep track of that so this is

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,160
not only for the junior engineers

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,040
personal development it also gives them

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,050
the input about the chunks that didn't

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,370
exactly sink in the first time and if

00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,410
you're anything like me there are many

00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,820
of these pieces where you'll get a large

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,170
chunk of the information the first time

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,580
and then some of the details will

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,930
dribble out the side

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,850
make sure you check in regularly with

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,610
your engineer it's really important to

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,920
just give them an opportunity to talk to

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,510
you openly and it probably seems pretty

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,040
obvious that they can do that but you'd

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,170
be surprised how much of a difference it

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,610
makes if you say are you having trouble

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,170
with anything is there anything I can

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,430
help you with it kind of opens up the

00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,710
floodgates and just give them a really

00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,050
good opportunity to take advantage of

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,480
your offer and maybe this is an

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,190
opportunity now to spend less time

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,500
shadowing and have them start

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,680
co-piloting on a larger project with a

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,890
more senior person so this is where they

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,660
can take turns driving and if you went

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,490
through drivers I'd like I do then the

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,380
person who's more experienced in the

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,660
passenger seat has a secret emergency

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,960
brake that they can use if anything goes

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,750
seriously awry so they get you take a

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,190
bigger role in a project but also have

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,440
the safety of knowing that there's

00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:00,120
someone who can help them when they get

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,980
stuck so once you've gone through this

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,160
continue to check on check in on goals

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,720
and Taylor projects and code labs to how

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,600
they're doing it's a really individual

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,880
an organic process so one-size-fits-all

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,920
isn't really going to work here stick

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,430
with the things at work and remove the

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,750
things that don't so one thing that's

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,910
really useful at this point though is a

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,080
sort of informal apprenticeship where a

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,180
senior engineer takes more

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,580
responsibility for a junior engineer and

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,140
passes on their domain knowledge the

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,150
junior engineer gets bigger chunks of

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,910
code that they are responsible for and

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,850
they're really sort of under someone's

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,680
wing and this has the added bonus of

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,990
training the senior person if they're

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,880
interested in it to play a bigger role

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,130
maybe in running a team or in heading

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,630
towards management one thing that we

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,240
haven't really discussed though is how

00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,550
you really assess how someone's doing or

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,990
how you fix it if they're not doing as

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,280
well as you'd like if they're on this

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,340
middle trajectory and you think they

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,040
have the potential to do much better how

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,550
do you do that really the answer is

00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,480
communication and let's say you talk to

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,400
them and you find that they're not

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,480
really is confident in their coding as

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,880
you want them to be often to suggest an

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,770
answer will lend itself to the question

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,910
at hand so if it's confidence for

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,490
example the

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,710
and maybe you set them some small quick

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,200
wins that they can do to make them feel

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,970
like they're really getting it or if

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,770
they're picking up some bad code habits

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,540
take a look at who their mentors are

00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,550
they may be picking up some things that

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,870
are okay for a senior engineer who

00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,460
really knows what they're doing but

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,870
habits you don't really want to instill

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,670
in your junior engineer when they're

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,590
straight out the gate but do you

00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,440
remember that not everyone comes out the

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,150
same this isn't a finish line that

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,610
everyone hits but you have the power to

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,410
set them up on a better trajectory and

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,940
I'm sure you all take that seriously

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,370
since you're here but it's a good thing

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,500
to remember I would like to mention that

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,590
the last slide was technically incorrect

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,440
I for some reason drew asymptotic lines

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,910
as though like people can like never

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,150
achieve anything above or below where

00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,470
they're at and that's not true so you

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,910
should just know that that slide is

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,190
incorrect but when you're thinking about

00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,840
the assessment categories for people if

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,330
someone isn't performing up to the

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,950
standards that you think they should be

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,510
performing too these are the five

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,820
categories we came up with to take a

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:21,370
look at so confidence code quality

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,020
communication judgment and technical

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,490
knowledge we've all worked with people

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,010
who are insufficient in one of these

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,660
categories and so it's important to

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,240
realize that it's not just technical

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,010
knowledge that people need help on so a

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,110
lot of times judgment is super important

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,490
are they building the right things

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,720
because if someone is building the right

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,460
thing it doesn't matter if they take

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,750
more or less time to do it they're going

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,610
to get to the right place at the end of

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:47,200
the day so this is our kota this is my

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,580
contribution to the slides in case you

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,060
were curious the rest of them arcades

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,040
responsibility and onboarding is a

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,140
problem like any other that we face in

00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,150
engineering and it's really best solved

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,180
through iteration and feedback and

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,550
revision and if you take one thing away

00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,410
from this presentation let it be keep

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,300
the communication channels open this is

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,890
the best way to ensure that you're both

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,770
on the same page and you're really

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,170
getting somewhere but if you have space

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,950
in your brain for three things let it be

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,570
these success is not just being the most

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,310
technically skilled there's a lot of

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:24,250
areas where it's really important for

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:27,180
people to develop it really benefits

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,180
everyone in the long run

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,390
and everyone can be involved it takes a

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,770
village to raise a child I'd like to

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,950
think that it takes an engineering team

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:41,230
to bring a junior developer on board

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:42,580
successfully okay so hopefully you guys

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,770
are convinced to start improving your

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,720
process now one of the things we talked

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,160
about a lot as engineers is code debt we

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,930
all know what this is and we're

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,460
terrified of it and I'm sure all of your

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,770
companies have lots of it that you are

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,980
sad about but people don't talk a lot

00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,260
about team debt or management debt which

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,460
is essentially you accrued debt with the

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,990
employees that you have on your team if

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,880
you don't take care of them and you

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,350
don't pay attention to them and so on

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,780
boarding is the first step in making

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,190
sure that you minimize this team debt so

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,660
that a year from now you don't have

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,280
people leaving because they got off on

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,280
the wrong foot or didn't have any help

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,690
at the beginning so we have a repo at

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,300
this link where we have some resources

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,430
to get like give new people on python

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,730
and django we have some of the rubrics

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,290
for assessing others so if you want any

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,230
resources you can go there and if you

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:31,380
have questions please ask them now thank

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,380
you

00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:42,330
thank you very much we have time for one

00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:46,409
question and I'm gonna walk over to this

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:55,769
mic stand where people will see you so

00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:57,239
one question please hi thank you a great

00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,099
presentation I was wondering if you

00:25:57,239 --> 00:26:00,839
could talk a little bit about adapting

00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,809
these techniques and ideas towards a

00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,509
distributed team that is a fantastic

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:08,339
question um one of the things I say

00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:09,899
about scaling a team is that the thing

00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:11,999
you're scaling is actually communication

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,349
communication is it's the bottleneck

00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,329
right you have a small team and everyone

00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:16,950
can talk to everyone I mean as you grow

00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:18,209
that's not possible and with a

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,459
distributed team I think communication

00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,289
is really like that's the crux of what's

00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:24,479
going on um you need people to be able

00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,339
to communicate about your processes

00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:29,159
about what's going on and all that

00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:31,409
different stuff so a lot of the things

00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,239
we talked about will still work I mean

00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,879
you could have a virtual social event

00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:37,889
you can still have people helped set up

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,690
dev environments but I think I think the

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:41,489
biggest thing is really focusing on the

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,690
communication channels because you're

00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:47,190
not going to be able to get information

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:52,200
to remote developers without that we do

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:55,109
have a resource on our repo that helps

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,869
code from afar when you're pairing helps

00:26:55,109 --> 00:27:00,839
pair from afar when you're coding there

00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:06,169
we go um so if you check that out that

00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,169
might help all right thank you

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,040
