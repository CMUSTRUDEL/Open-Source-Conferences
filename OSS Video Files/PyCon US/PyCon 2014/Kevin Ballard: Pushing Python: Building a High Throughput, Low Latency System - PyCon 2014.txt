	Speaker: Kevin Ballard

Taba is a distributed metrics aggregator, similar in concept to statsd. Built with Python using Redis, gevent, and Cython, it currently handles over 6M events/sec with strong consistency guarantees. This talk will present an overview of its design, and discuss the challenges and solutions encountered in the process of building a high throughput, low latency distributed service.
