Title: Ned Jackson Lovely: Enough Machine Learning to Make Hacker News Readable Again - PyCon 2014
Publication date: 2014-04-12
Playlist: PyCon 2014
Description: 
	Speaker: Ned Jackson Lovely

It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just a "pip install" away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.
