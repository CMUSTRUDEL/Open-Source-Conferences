Title: James Bennett: Django: The good parts - PyCon 2014
Publication date: 2014-04-24
Playlist: PyCon 2014
Description: 
	Speaker: James Bennett

Lots of talks and tutorials try to cover Django exhaustively, going over every component and feature. But not so many take a look at the bits that let Django be Django. In this talk, we'll see exactly what those bits -- some old, some new -- are, in a way that shows why it's still a solid and popular choice for web developers nearly nine years after its initial public release.
