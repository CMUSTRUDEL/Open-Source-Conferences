	Speakers: Karen Rustad, Asheesh Laroia

Learn how to let other people connect straight to your computer, so your Python web apps, email services, or anything else can be seen by the world. It starts simple, then explains when and how to use SimpleHTTPServer, ssh tunnels, Pagekite, and IPv6. You can use these tools for temporary connections, like sharing an in-progress demo, or for permanent connectivity for your home server.
