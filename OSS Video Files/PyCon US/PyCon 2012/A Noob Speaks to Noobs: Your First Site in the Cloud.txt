okay sounds good this is the first talk

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:14,630
and I am really pleased to have Katie

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:19,410
Cunningham here giving us a talk on a

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:21,779
noob speaks two noobs your first sight

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:32,399
in the cloud everyone give a round of

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:34,770
applause to Katie hi I'm Katie

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,129
Cunningham I'm a python and django

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,710
developer at Cox Media Group a little

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,960
bit about me I was always a dev but I

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,110
was never an OP never had to set up

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,420
servers I never had to deploy my servers

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,570
I always had sysadmin zand engineers

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,579
doing it for me so it was magic I made

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,000
code they made it go on the web it was

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,579
really awesome one day I was determined

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,410
I was going to do it all on my own I was

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,430
going to administer my own site because

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,110
I really wanted a personal site so this

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,260
is when I learned why I really needed to

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,729
learn about server basics I had a

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,020
bulletin board this is way back when

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,720
this was cool to have a bulletin board

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,119
and one day I had a managed service

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,310
provider so they just made it happen for

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,960
me it was awesome and I put in all these

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,970
add-ons it was great and then one day

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,189
there was a security issue and they

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,439
upgraded it and it broke everything I

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,240
didn't have many users I only had about

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,770
30 or 40 users but I these were my

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
friends these are people i knew their

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,079
kids i knew their families we had met I

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,600
was now like trying frantically to get

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,890
everything to work again and I realized

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,329
I didn't have the power I had to

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,280
basically scrap everything and start

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,659
over again that's when I learned I

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,860
really didn't like managed service

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,509
providers I wanted control so i decided

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,950
i was going to learn to you know learn

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,470
unix and i was going to figure

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,649
everything out i picked up a book and

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,020
the first step was this was hilarious go

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,790
in your house and find a spare computer

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,710
and install debian on it what Oh spare

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,630
computer I have my work laptop that's it

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,820
and I have my game I'm not I don't

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,230
have liked hours speckled all over my

00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,680
house this is not something I have a

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,510
spare thing of and then it was 20 pages

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,640
no lie of how to resolve all the

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,470
hardware issues and I think I actually

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,660
threw the book across the room after a

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,290
very long weekend of not getting any

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,860
farther and learning unix basics so

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,240
eventually I move to the cloud clouds

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,400
are wonderful they give you a server

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,010
it's all set up but its bare bones and

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,140
you have full control over it that was

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,280
why i decided i really like deploying in

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,100
the cotton i really didn't want to

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,620
manage my own server so first we're

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,690
going to set some ground rules when you

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,990
have your own server do not mess around

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,060
on the server if you log in you should

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,710
just be looking don't touch anything

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,240
don't change anything trust me you will

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,120
hit your life if you start changing

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,970
things around I cratered so many of my

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,070
sites doing this you don't test on

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,390
production this sounds like it of course

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,010
you wouldn't test on production but it's

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,630
very tempting at 2am when you've

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,920
discovered something really cool and

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,200
you're like hey you know I'll go ahead

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,460
and you know try this out you end up

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
spending the rest of the weekend trying

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,780
to back out and trying to figure out

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,160
where everything went pear-shaped you

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,290
never push from your local if you've

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,750
changed a file in your local like all

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,030
change it here i'll upload it that can

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,860
be dangerous because you'll see later

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,960
you want to be able to rebuild your

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,170
entire site from scratch with one press

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,480
of a button and you're going to change

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,790
things one at a time when i started that

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
it was very basic and then i would

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,750
basically i change one thing very

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,670
carefully i look for you know if it

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,970
affected anything then i would change

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,430
the next thing reason i do this i'm

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,350
still not good at troubleshooting I'm

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,510
definitely not like the people that I

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,890
work with that can look at something

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,330
look its laws oh yeah this is what's

00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,730
going around take this out move this and

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,900
you have a permissions issue it I start

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,130
getting glassy-eyed after very long so

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,490
some of the tools will be using fabric

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,860
who is used fabric a good number of

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,680
hands not enough but I'll see more hands

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,959
by the end you'll need a local unix box

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,030
for a while I developed on like a mac or

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,739
windows or whatever I actually found

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,859
that when I was learning it was easier

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,560
to start off with the same o

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:26,719
I was going to have out there it just

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,159
made things a lot easier now I'm a

00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,960
little more experienced now I can

00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,180
develop anywhere and I've you know I

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,280
figured out the issues but that's that's

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,729
a level of complexity you don't want you

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,280
know when you first start using git and

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,740
github you definitely want to pick some

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,419
kind of repository I use get I use

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,219
github I like them but there's plenty of

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,469
bitbucket there's all kinds of things

00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,599
you've using google code whatever but

00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:53,960
have a repository somewhere that you're

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:57,439
going to be saving things so first we

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,659
want to pick an OS some things you don't

00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,250
want to do don't be proud there are

00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:02,870
operating systems out there they

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,710
definitely give you some geek cred if

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:09,199
you use them if you're in this talk you

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:13,159
have not worked up to geek cred level so

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,169
pick one that works for you don't pick

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,699
the wine your significant other the one

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,750
you use at work your neighbor uses your

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,120
twitter friends use it your favorite

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,449
sites use it they're not going to help

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,490
you I'm marrying a sysadmin he still

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,169
doesn't help me with my stupid site he

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,389
doesn't want to look at it at the end of

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,310
the day you know like I've having issues

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:33,710
with my mouth my security serene he's

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,839
like I can't I've been doing this all

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:40,219
day I'm done they're not going to help

00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:42,169
you you're on your own you use the one

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:43,849
that works for you if you can get your

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,250
site running on a bunt to he's a bunt 0

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:50,599
if you can get it using debian or

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,889
whatever use that one i use a bun to it

00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,169
was the first thing that really works

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,909
for me that had the best documents you

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,370
know just for what I specifically wanted

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:00,319
to do there are other ones that's the

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,650
one I like and that's the one we'll be

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,689
using for the rest of this talk so

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,500
picking a provider one things you want

00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,689
some of the things you want to look for

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,659
make sure it has the OS you've decided

00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:13,610
to use I made this mistake once i went

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,439
to a provider and I'm like oh crap you

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,900
don't use 1 i'm familiar with well i'm

00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,110
sure i could get around it though it was

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,080
really painful make sure you actually

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,330
can ssh into the box some of providers

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
that are out there they hide the fact

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,199
that they're managed service providers

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,209
if you ask them can I get to my bucks

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,150
can I ssh to it and they say no you

00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:37,700
don't want to go there

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,100
make sure you have root access this is

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,630
very important you're going to be

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,070
managing your box if you don't have root

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,220
access you're not managing your box

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,780
you're asking permission and you want

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,580
the ability to clone your instance they

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,320
call this different things on service

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,450
providers but if you actually just call

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,310
the 1-800 number or get in their web

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,260
chat or something and say can i clone it

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,840
yeah you can clone it we call it this

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,610
they all have a different name for it

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,710
here's some providers there's even more

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,240
this is not an exhaustive lips this is

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,740
just for things I threw up there that

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,290
came off the top of my head if you go

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,750
into the vendor area I counted like five

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:16,870
more so go talk to some of them you know

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,580
ask them these questions i use Rackspace

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,780
before we get going we need to think

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,040
about how we're going to serve the site

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,750
if you're just a developer you've

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,230
probably never had to serve your side I

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,300
use Jengo I've used clone and they're

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,520
always development servers and you just

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,950
run you run the server or you you know

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,600
do the bill that and it just runs it

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,100
automatically and it's beautiful you

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,280
don't have to worry about how you're

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,660
going to serve it to another person and

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,190
there's a lot of choices with this you

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,070
can use apache you know all these other

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,990
things i use apache and mod whiskey

00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,030
because i'm too lazy to move over to

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,460
anything else and i have very small

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,430
sites this works for me there are ones

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,650
that do there are ones to you know do

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,400
better caching or they're cooler these

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,560
work setting up apache you need to

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,700
actually have the files for apache but

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,890
it's easier i mean i thought it was

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,510
really complicated and then I had

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,800
somebody sit down and it's two files

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:14,150
that's it you have like you know my site

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,340
that whiskey this is going to be put

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,340
somewhere else later on the site for

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,650
Apache to read because mod whiskey helps

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:27,400
you serve Python applications and these

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,870
all you're doing is saying where it is

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,620
you know where we need to append of you

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,920
know append the Python path where our

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,420
settings are do some imports and stuff

00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,720
and all the rest is just crafted the

00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,580
only things you're changing that line

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,430
and that line that's it and we'll get

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,150
into that later virtualhost i use

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,290
virtual hose because i'm cheap and

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,360
don't want to have a server for every

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:55,160
site so i usually have a couple of sites

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,170
on each server and these are really easy

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,150
you know it's an email address it's your

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,900
server name it's another name for your

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,670
server where you actually have like your

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,630
django site and this is for Jengo but

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,040
this will work for other pyramid

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,420
whatever this will work for many others

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,520
pwned is the only exception plum is

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,810
special so you need to look at the plan

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,050
docks but the plan docks are good for

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,160
serving you know your log level how you

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,200
you know how quickly do you what your

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,230
log files filled you have to give it a

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,830
whiskey Damon that's basically serving

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,750
and the only thing you have to worry

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:34,560
about there is my user whatever your

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,110
username is going to be where your

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,880
script is where your media is which is

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,150
very important if you actually want to

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,700
have CSS where the admin media is if you

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,520
don't want to piss off your admins and

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,960
that's pretty much it so getting the

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,510
server this is actually super easy you

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,090
go through web interface but it's super

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,090
easy going to rackspace you login you go

00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,480
to cloud servers you click add server

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,360
you pick your OS this is always the part

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,950
where I would stop and think because you

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,020
can get different sizes and it's a

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,510
little hard to see there but it tells

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,240
you over on the side how much it costs

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,310
but it's per second and I'm sitting

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,230
there going crap how much is that what

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,640
does that even mean well basically the

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,560
smallest one is about 10 bucks a month

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,720
you know and it goes up to maybe 12 a

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,730
few more days in the month but it really

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,020
it's a pretty it's a cheap option but

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,420
it's always given me a little bit of a

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,360
stopping like oh god how much is this

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,800
kind of cost I don't like my sites too

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,060
suddenly cost a hundred dollars you're

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
going to create it and it's going to

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,410
give you a password seriously save that

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,860
password okay i have so many times close

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,450
that and kind wasn't password clamped it

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,240
i've actually write it down and i have

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,550
to rebuild the entire server again or

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,700
wait for the email to come through and

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,100
sometimes the email doesn't come through

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,860
and yeah it's done you have a site and

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,420
you have a server in a look at that so

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,680
some words about this server the first

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,200
time i logged into the service

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,290
playing around it's super bare bones

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,330
there's nothing installed like at all i

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:13,680
was used to these beautifully well build

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:15,570
servers they gave me nothing it was like

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,810
the harsh reality that being a sysadmin

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,120
is hard and and of course i had all my

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:24,200
sis admits last me yeah yeah that's why

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,220
you know we have to come in every day

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,020
setting up the server you have the shiny

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,050
new server so let's login let's install

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,730
things no no we are not logging in we're

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,430
not screwing around with the server yet

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,200
we're starting this the right way we're

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,610
going to make a fabric script because

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,589
one of the fabric of the first fabric

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,790
script I make is always to setup the

00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:47,130
server just get my site on the server

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,750
because fabric will save you if you ever

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,700
crater your site if something bad

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,270
happens you can get your sight back up

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:57,360
quickly it does lots of things Fabregas

00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:00,060
cool if you start reading into it I use

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,980
three commands I've seen really complex

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,290
fabric strips all I use is pseudo which

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,570
means do this on the server local do

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,089
this on my machine and put take a file

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,520
from my local and put it on the remote

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,779
machine you install this on your local

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,490
doesn't actually go on your server this

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,709
I found confusing when somebody first

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,089
explained fabric to me it just goes on

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,510
your local where you're going to be

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:23,670
deploying from and it looks kind of

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,120
coffee but basically it's you know fed

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,700
what why am I going to be running what

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,430
host that'll be either my site com or

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,930
your IP address minus you and your user

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,730
the first time you run that's you run

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,940
this is root there are no other users on

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,200
your fancy new server and which function

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:46,500
you want to run so servers we're going

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,850
to do all these things these are sits

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,160
the quick list of what we're going to

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,130
have to do so we need to set up some

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,990
packages we need to pachi I was like why

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,520
wouldn't you put Apache on a server just

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,290
automatically but apparently some people

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,649
don't need it or they use something

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,520
different this is really bare bones

00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,250
subversion because I do occasionally

00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,670
have to check things out of subversion

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,959
from the remote machine sqlite3 not

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,910
doesn't come with the machine if you're

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,980
going to use Django you have to install

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,230
whatever you're going to be using as

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,399
your database

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,100
Python setuptools these are systems good

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,690
things to have you know gate we're going

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,209
to be using it I kind of like having

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,560
these on the machine it makes life

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,470
easier and of course we're going to have

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,750
to install mod whiskey so let's get our

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,510
server ready we're going to be setting

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,800
up the server and this is very simple

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,750
reasonably going to take all the

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,899
packages I just showed you and for each

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,690
one go install it and don't bug me that

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,190
minus y is so very important if you

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,570
forget it you hate life and that's why I

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,040
love doing it in a script because then I

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,180
never forget it just means don't bug me

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,889
I don't care download everything add a

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,079
user because we don't run as root do we

00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,610
now now I tried that one time I'm like

00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,660
oh that rude thing that's stupid I'll

00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,130
just go ahead and run this route know

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,649
everything we've screwed up nothing

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,529
would work you want to add a user for

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:07,610
yourself so all it's doing is basically

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:11,399
touching a local file called passwords

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,660
it's adding a user remotely it's adding

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,480
it to sue doors this is going to appear

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,850
person with sudo rights creates a

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,800
password that's their password and then

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,940
puts it in the file on your local so now

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,699
you have your username and your password

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,230
on your local so you actually don't have

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:27,420
to like remember what it says here

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,720
because I will forget to like write that

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,760
down and I'll clear my console need to

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,889
install your pip things right now we

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,649
only have one thing so why bother with

00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:39,690
this because your list of fit things is

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,940
going to grow I'm pip installing Django

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,699
my current site has like a pip list of

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,290
like 20 things if I ever blow up my

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:50,069
server things I just have to go

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,470
reinstall so it's not done yet we've to

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,760
move some files basically we're going to

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,389
be checking out the files that you

00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:01,350
dutifully checked into subversion or get

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:03,180
or a bit bucket because the reason is if

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,610
you start changing things on your local

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,769
it gets really easy to get out of sync

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,690
and I've said it many times I'll take it

00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,579
in later don't worry about it I never

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,889
check it in and then I built on top of

00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,170
that old file and then I Mike where did

00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:18,600
my CSS go why is this not working and

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,819
that file is long since gone because

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,779
I've cleaned it out you know and I have

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:26,850
to go recreate all my work so I never

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,859
ever push from local I always check out

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,149
from wherever I checked it into

00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:32,589
so all this is doing is making like a

00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:36,040
nice little temporary directory on the

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:39,269
server doing some cleanup because this

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,359
is something that will run many times I

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:45,699
check it out I make a tar file and then

00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,399
I push it up so now the file is up there

00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:50,439
and then I go ahead and on tar it so all

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,579
my files are ready they're ready to be

00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:55,839
moved and there's more setup we need to

00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,589
place the files the files are on the

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,419
server but they're not in the right

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,009
place and this I don't know why I

00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,649
separate this out this way I just like

00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:05,079
separating these so basically it's

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,029
taking it's moving some of my setup

00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,660
files which is all the Apache files that

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:15,939
I dutifully checked in to my git repo

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:18,309
it's adding you know my whiskey file and

00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,809
it blanked out a bunch of the basically

00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,209
we have to move your template somewhere

00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:23,980
you're going to have to move your media

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,919
you know you're going to have to move

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,079
things into the correct location these

00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:35,259
two services you're gonna have to start

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:36,789
some services um and 8am a2n site which

00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:40,089
I've never known how to pronounce all

00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:42,669
it's doing is copying your whiskey file

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:45,850
from one area to another doing a symlink

00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:48,339
and it just says now we have this file

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:52,449
and then you need to restart apache too

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:54,249
I always that's my rule is like I always

00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:56,259
restart apache if I make changes just go

00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:58,029
ahead bump this up you know restart

00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,100
apache we've run into issues people

00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,499
saying why don't need to restart apache

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,750
because the documentation says i don't

00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:08,169
have to restart apache documentation

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:12,279
lies because it was written by us and

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:14,380
we're liars so just don't trust it

00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,929
restarting apache doesn't hurt anything

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,490
just go ahead and do it and if it does

00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:22,149
hurt something maybe you need to have

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,179
uverse issues you know so we're going

00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:27,669
boom maybe site do it again delete your

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,049
spice run everything again because I ran

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:31,840
into this a few times when I was helping

00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,580
people something went wrong what did

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,070
they did they fix the fabric strip no no

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,760
no they went on the server and did

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:42,280
things by hand and they forgot about it

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,470
so they went and they we move them back

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,650
and it's like no fix your fabrics if

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,110
anything goes wrong fix it there we run

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,970
it do this until your script runs to

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,040
completion and you have a website in you

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,380
and your browser open up the IP address

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,620
and you have it going until you get to

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,070
that point do not you know think you're

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,380
done something's eventually you're going

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,020
to want to update this is where you want

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,700
to be able to clone your server I love

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,190
cloning servers because it gives you a

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,350
perfect match the server you have now

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,810
and you can mess with it all you want

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,100
you can screw things up you can test

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,930
deployments you can send it to people

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,430
and say what do you think of this now

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,530
they are charging you but they're

00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,180
charging me by the second so usually I

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,460
mean I had one up for like a few days

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:32,230
and forgot about it it was three bucks I

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,040
mean I spend more on coffee so basically

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,870
you're going to do is you're going to

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,700
create an image of your site this

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,320
actually takes a while even if you have

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,170
a teeny tiny I mean I was testing it

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,900
earlier teeny tiny nothing site it takes

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,460
a while because they have to queue it

00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,150
you're going to name the image name it

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,440
something sensible and you make a new

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,480
server you go back just like you did

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,750
click Add server but they're going to

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,460
allow you to create it from an image

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:01,180
once again you pick the size pick the

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:03,130
smallest and now you're ready you have a

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,440
perfect clone of the server and now you

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,030
can push your updates to that first and

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,480
touch them because once again you're

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:13,990
using a fab file now I don't have time

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,980
to go over an update fab file because we

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,480
are running should I was going to pull

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,180
out the actual fat file I'll be happy to

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,680
show it to anybody later basically you

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,530
want a function that will update your

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,300
CSS near MIDI on your templates that is

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,300
something I use like every other day

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,530
because I'm always tweaking stuff you

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,350
want to be able to install a new library

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,300
I highly recommend having just a core

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,730
file you pull on that says okay these

00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,730
are all my libraries and I'm going to

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,080
install the new one you want to update

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,460
be able to update your settings file

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,620
because that happens you have to update

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,380
you have to add something to it usually

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,490
I just change it check it in and have it

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,020
reuploaded always restart your services

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,470
there's the two services i showed you i

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,270
always

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,280
we start those no matter what if they

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,710
don't damage anything you know they

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,370
can't restart badly so just go ahead

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,320
restart apache to some next steps for

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,909
you try swapping out elements i mean i

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,850
pointed to a bunch of different ways to

00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:11,950
serve your website try one you know but

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,630
try it on your clone but now you have a

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,950
chance but change things one at a time I

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,490
mean that's a really cool thing to play

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,679
with caching caching is kind of clear

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,100
you can put in things like you know what

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,360
is it squid or varnish or things like

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,419
that if you really feel like you're

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,679
going to need caching try it try

00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:35,770
memcache this is not a secure site yet

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,750
we do not have HTS this is very basic so

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,970
research that try to figure out how to

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,900
get that going that's actually

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,520
deceptively hard and you know attach a

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,049
domain to your server which is kind of

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,220
important events that you probably want

00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:50,770
to not be giving out your IP address

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,760
over and over but you know attach a

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:57,360
domain and that isn't that's my talk do

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,360
we have any questions

00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:20,710
yes leave a microphone here so you might

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:20,710
want to come up is it on that one yeah

00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,919
it's a really quick question are you

00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,470
going to share at the fabric files and

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,840
some of the things yes I will I wish I

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,779
had time all of my slides corrupted on

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,119
my flight over and I did a 24 hours to

00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:40,369
recreate all my slides okay love to see

00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:41,840
them thank you oh ok I do cool i will

00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:44,359
show you i have my fat files they're

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,759
just not in the slides ah let's see

00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:54,970
don't want to show you that what they go

00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:58,249
oh here they are this there we go this

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,619
as soon as i get it up this is my

00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:03,529
ridiculously large update file this is

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,450
from a recent update um as you see i

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:08,019
usually give like the name of the file

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,729
directory this is not something that's

00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,379
this is just me I do this because I like

00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:14,749
to see that the file name and the

00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:16,159
directory separate just because when I'm

00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,440
working I tend to be more familiar with

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,739
the file name i'm working with and when

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,499
I see yadda yadda / idea I my eyes grey

00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:25,940
out and I have done that bribe uploaded

00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,739
the wrong file and I'm hitting refresh

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,840
and trying to figure out why my file

00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:31,879
didn't upload and i just uploaded the

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,229
wrong file so i put my file name first

00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:36,220
you don't have to that and that's just

00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:38,690
because i have weird vision issues

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,389
you'll see i have also like check out

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,389
apps there's one app I use that does not

00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:47,090
have and when I find him I'm going to

00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:48,619
make sure he gets like in pi PI so I can

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,999
help install him because he's the last

00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:54,169
loan person I can't do that for but we

00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:57,289
have like you know here's the app get

00:22:54,169 --> 00:23:01,879
install you saw that you know the PIP

00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:03,470
installs this is one gets DP my get DV

00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:06,739
is for what I want to get my production

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,629
database down to my local all this does

00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:10,129
is it grabs the file that i have and

00:23:08,629 --> 00:23:12,470
pulls it down and then puts it in the

00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:14,570
right place and backs up my mom back

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,789
with the 1i have locally sometimes I

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,919
need to do stuff

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,840
my database or I need to double check

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,359
something there are times when I really

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,369
don't what a blog post to go out early

00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,350
but I need to make sure it looks right

00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,899
and I need to make sure i'm testing like

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:31,090
my feeds and stuff and one thing you

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:33,070
never want to do don't screw with your

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,919
feeds on production because then you

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,359
will totally slam like planet python and

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,889
people hate you because you'll have like

00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:45,159
30 articles and planet python you have a

00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:47,859
question a request as somebody that

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,259
helps out on fabric will you post this

00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:52,330
to github yes as a repository that's an

00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:55,659
example that people could contribute

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,399
ideas too yes I will I will um I

00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,379
actually meant to as I said before the

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:04,149
talk but I was kind of busy you know

00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:05,889
thank you guys some of the things being

00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:07,269
placing files and I don't know why those

00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:09,279
will white it out but all let's do it's

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:11,229
moving the files that's it that's all I

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,809
want to care about move it to this

00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:16,690
directory and this is just my weird

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:18,789
setup for my files is because this is

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,919
literally I was you know grabbing my

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,450
hair and I finally found the one thing

00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,159
that worked the one walk through that

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,929
took me from step one to step you know

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,599
10 which is one of the funny things

00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,759
about when developers and sis admins and

00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:34,690
engineers write instructions they skip

00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:37,450
steps they skip step 1 37 and I it's

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,190
like they skip random steps and they

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,809
don't tell you where to start you know

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,759
they don't tell you of course you have

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,710
to install Apache before you started and

00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,749
i just read that nice and elbow patch

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,249
you must already be installed cool but i

00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:49,720
don't know which apache to install i

00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:51,249
didn't realize there was this like okay

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,019
there's two how old are these

00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,399
instructions is this like a really old

00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:59,649
guy that's probably still like using

00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:03,159
some arcane version is like yeah you

00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:05,019
know but anyway this was the first one

00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,119
that worked so i copied his directory

00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:09,879
structure exactly because I got tired of

00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,279
typos that's why its my Django's it's

00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:13,779
stupid I need to redo it but since I'm

00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:18,789
the only person on my server I don't

00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:21,369
really care yet and get files just

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:22,929
basically takes out the files creates a

00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:24,909
nice little tar file that I can move

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,830
around I actually because my site is

00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,980
small I just take out all the files I

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,450
could check out individual files

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,950
but it was a level of complexity that

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,100
seems really silly when I were already

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,570
was placing individual files somebody

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,190
suggested was why don't you just take

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,230
the latest files that you've checked in

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,419
Mike obviously you do not know how I

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,419
work I have half-finished files in my

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,890
repo occasionally because yes we should

00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,140
only check and we're ready but sometimes

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,330
I have to check in because dinner's

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,950
ready and I have to check it in and my

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,540
kids are around i really don't want them

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,700
to destroy my laptop and all the work

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,010
I've done for the past two hours so

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:03,900
sometimes I just check-in just because I

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:05,460
really worry something will happen same

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,750
thing for services but basically you run

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,890
to play this here it's deploy them

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,140
because occasionally I do have to do a

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,419
deploy want to play too like deploy this

00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,400
I have to do something else like if I

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,030
have to start a service somewhere else

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,540
on some site by hand I'll to do that but

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:24,270
um this one all it's doing its you know

00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:27,799
what is this it's doing whatever the app

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,540
get I need to install all the new stuff

00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,580
do some pip installs you know get your

00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,130
files and put your files you know it's

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,559
pretty simple and it looks it's long but

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,450
it's actually really really simple and

00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,790
anybody that's worked on a Mac even can

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,220
understand a lot of these Unix commands

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,890
it's just putting it together was very

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,030
difficult took me a while until I could

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:58,429
successfully maintain my own site how

00:26:51,030 --> 00:27:02,040
are we on time huh any more questions

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:04,160
yes you need to buy I'll repeat your

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,160
question

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,710
Oh

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,549
I

00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:17,350
um no because they do his question was

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,759
he's worried that somebody is going to

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,529
slam a server and he's going to get a

00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,559
bill for like three hundred dollars and

00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:26,409
I almost had this once back in the day

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,210
one of the nice things about the new

00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:29,679
servers is they will cap you and they

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,710
won't keep charging you they'll just

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,129
shut down your site and you can actually

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,499
set up things like I use Google

00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:40,809
Analytics and Google Analytics will

00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:42,519
watch how many hits i'm getting and if I

00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:45,669
start getting an absurd number of hits

00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,889
it emails me and it says something weird

00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:50,289
is going on you need to go look at your

00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:52,779
site now granted the only time that

00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:55,960
happened was my got rented one day and

00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,059
it was ridiculously low to I was so

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,879
pathetic my threshold was like three

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,799
hundred hits in a day which is so sadly

00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,029
low and I'm like and Google was like

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,889
freaking out i mean i think i'm getting

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:08,320
a not attacked and of a government it's

00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:11,700
like oh oh it was just read it i guess

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,049
they like something i posted okay cool

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,899
but that was really the only time but it

00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:21,429
is nice i keep it reasonably low like I

00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:23,919
expect so many hits but if I go double

00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,169
above that please alert me and let me

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,940
know and then you can do stuff about it

00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,950
you could always just shut down the

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,799
server until the botnet attack stops

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,570
bring it up investigate why I mean

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,399
chances are with our but the puny little

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,200
sites most of us are probably going to

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,049
be creating if you're worried about that

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,450
kind of stuff you're probably not going

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:46,090
to be important enough for that and if

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,580
it is it's probably fleeting if you're

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,369
really really really worried look into

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,889
some kind of cashing service that you

00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:56,230
could go to I don't know what the cheap

00:28:53,889 --> 00:29:00,779
version of akamai would be but look into

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,779
something like that any more questions

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,820
