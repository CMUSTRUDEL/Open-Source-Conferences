be splitting three ways to Autism Speaks

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:44,919

everyone for showing up donating etc

00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:59,169
um just a couple of quick announcements

00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:01,360
before I hand it before I announce a

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,519
couple of Community Service Award

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,580
winners and everything else there's some

00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:10,389
lost and found I recommend picking up

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,819
your driver's licenses and a netbook

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,189
sleeve tonight we have the same path

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,659

food buses are running again tonight

00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:29,199
other than that I've got some community

00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:33,789
award winners where are the oh they're

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,039
on the other side do you want an

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,079
announce these teeth okay you can do it

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,239
just well no we can both do it we can

00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,119
indeed oh and we do seem to have the

00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:47,079
other in bags now necessary don't worry

00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:50,519
we'll sort it out so the community

00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:53,589
service award uh we handed out quarterly

00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,239
we normally make two awards every court

00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,979
over there in separate bags yes they are

00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,749
we normally make two awards every

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,999
quarter that's right yeah handle that

00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:03,279
when I'll unwrap this and so the First

00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:06,249
Community Service Award winner that I'd

00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,050
like to announce is Carl trait as he

00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:10,179
actually here today did he get to know

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,969
Carl unfortunately cannot have a ten

00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,409
pike on this year but we've had some

00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:17,139
discussion about it the one of the

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,429
choices that you have for the award you

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,709
got the choice of either a money award

00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:22,809
or alternatively a free registration to

00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,669
Pike on next year so I think thanks to

00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:28,149
the free registration we probably can

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,229
expect to see Carl here next year but I

00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,879
think we should all give Carla round of

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,769
applause he's basically given that he

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,709
was being given the award for the work

00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:39,610
that he's done to put foreign language

00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:42,129
and foreign alphabets onto the wiki so

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,749
that non-english speaking Python users

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,339
could find a more natural environment

00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:47,909
when they when they first come to python

00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,779
and it's the kind of work that's

00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,399
actually not really very well

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,749
appreciated too much so I think I'd like

00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,289
you all to give Carl a good round of

00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:55,289
applause for

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,370
and the next one I believe she's

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,300
actually here today I hope she is is

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:15,110
Audrey Roy is Audrey Roy in the audience

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:18,870
she better be and as you probably know

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,720
Audrey was the founder of the pie ladies

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,000
group and has done a huge amount to

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,050
increase gender diversity in the Python

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,050
world thank you very much

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,900
and and with that I gladly hand it over

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:41,370
to our illustrious Chairman Steve Holden

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,960
thank you very much I thought with us it

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,280
when he said our illustrious Chairman I

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,370
thought we must have had a new chairman

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,260
appointed without me knowing hmm so I'd

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,990
like to echo Jesse's warm welcome to you

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,330
all on the second day of this amazing

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,300
python and before I go any further I

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,760
want to yet again place on public record

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,950
my admiration and gratitude for Jesse's

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:11,920
hard work so again thank you very much

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:14,290
Jesse so a few words of introduction

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,990
just in case anybody doesn't know me I'm

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,400
principally the most important function

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,020
i'm here at PyCon for is to be the

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,130
chairman of the the python Software

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,530
Foundation which is a terrific

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,420
opportunity because people keep coming

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,310
up and thanking me for organizing Python

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,960
when in fact I have hardly anything to

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,690
do with it at all but I'm quite happy to

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,000
carry on accepting your thanks on behalf

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,460
on behalf of the other organizers I met

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,710
someone today and I said incredible

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,510
we've got 2,200 odd people here and she

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,510
said yes and that's a lot of odd people

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,180
so I do have a couple of businesses the

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,980
first one delivers training and systems

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,140
consultancy and the second runs open

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,790
source conferences and technically

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,740
events you may notice the open Bastion

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,990
is a sponsor this year so I'm only

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,640
mentioning those really mostly to remind

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,040
my accountants that they do still exist

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,950
despite the fact that they get neglected

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,430
sometimes when things get busy on the

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,960
Python Software Foundation front so I'm

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,140
a great believer in the strength of

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,540
common bonds forged by shared experience

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,550
and you may not have come to python to

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,230
bond with people but you may be

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,510
surprised a lot of people don't come

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,540
it's a bit like if you remember the

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,060
story that Mark Twain wrote where Tom

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,490
Tom what's it what's his name Tom anyway

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,980
here people came to whitewash people

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,050
came to whitewash and remained to jeer

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,820
while people come to Pike on to program

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,230
and they remain as members of the

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,330
community we hook them in and that's

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,500
that's what we're trying to do so when

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,360
you can't I like to think when you come

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,550
to Pike on you leave a little bit of

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,399
yourself behind and you find it again

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,230
time you you come to Pike on so a great

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,390
believer in community there was this

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,120
exchange yesterday between two people on

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,589
the on the pike on organizers team one

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,399
of them said go home and the other one

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:06,640
says I am home right this is PI common

00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:08,470
basically so that exchange was between

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,570
two stalwarts of the conference who've

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,910
given quite literally as jesse has

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,160
thousands of hours to make this

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,160
conference the huge success that it's

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,680
become it typifies the spirit that makes

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,480
Pikkon so enjoyable you don't want to

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,810
know what this conference would cost you

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,839
if we didn't have sponsorship so having

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,149
in some way fathered pike on myself it's

00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,640
it's somewhat startling now as I tweeted

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,760
yesterday my little conference is all

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,850
grown up so it's quite an emotional

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,760
event for me not only because of what PI

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,500
cons turned into in these ten years but

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,149
also because this is my last address to

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,820
Pike on as chairman of the Python

00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,399
Software Foundation I'm very happy to

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,399
say that the the board who are able

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,720
assisted by our secretary and

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,560
administrator Pat Campbell is well able

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,029
to face tomorrow's challenges without me

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,920
but I do want to emphasize that while

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm leaving the chair I am NOT leaving

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,820
the foundation and I'm certainly not

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,060
leaving a community that I've spent 10

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,160
years nurturing so do expect to see me

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,700
around and if you if you don't believe

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,020
my commitment to python then you should

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,020
ask to see my latest tattoo

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,290
you think you're going to get to see

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:41,959
that without making a donation to the

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:41,959
fight and software foundation haha

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:48,180
alright let me just reveal a certain

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,380
amount of information by saying I'm

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,300
wearing a long-sleeved shirt so it's

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,950
going to be difficult right we may need

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,310
to wait but before the end of the

00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:00,130
conference perhaps so when I involve

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,350
myself in the Python world back in 1995

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,240
I I quickly realized that Python

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,570
represented something very special it

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,590
represented a new approach to

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,750
object-oriented programming which I've

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,570
actually kind of given up for eight or

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,160
ten years until i came across Python so

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,890
the fact that pythons a pragmatic

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,440
readable concise to the point language

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,810
is great and it's sometimes still

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,020
surprising to find out just exactly how

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:28,570
few lines of Python you need to write

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,850
some really amazing software and get

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,340
startling results I I deal with text a

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,290
lot and so I usually have an interpreter

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,910
window open just to interactively be

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,620
able to handle the text so I think we

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,110
all owe a huge debt of gratitude to

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,300
Guido and to the cast of hundreds of

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,790
developers and assistants who've joined

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,570
him to make Python the the wonderful

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,570
language that it is

00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,570
now people don't use Python just because

00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,890
they think that the syntax is beautiful

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,690
or because they think that Guido's

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,700
extraordinarily good looking even though

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,110
of course both those things do happen to

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,760
be true but they really like Python

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,430
because it's an amazingly productive way

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,470
to get computers to do things the

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,480
success of the Python early adopters

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,550
once we managed to persuade them to

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,800
start talking about the secret weapon

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:24,250
that it arranged their success Eve their

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,990
success also brought Python to the

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,080
public attention so we have to thank

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,810
small companies like digital creations

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,730
now zouk corporation and also large

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,970
companies like Google Disney and the

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,040
other sponsors around the hall we have

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,900
to thank those for helping people to

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,270
realize that Python genuinely does

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,850
represent an improvement in programming

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,800
language design and another thing that's

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,810
somewhat unusual I think about python is

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,780
that we know that pythons not perfect

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:56,170
but we like it anyway doesn't have to be

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,450
perfect so pythons very well placed now

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,390
to start appearing in all kinds of

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,130
unexpected places it is widely used by

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,170
experienced programmers but it's also

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,120
being built into other types of systems

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,550
and so I'm now in my training work

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,040
having to deal with engineers of all

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,960
kinds and when you think about the types

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,000
of systems that spice python is being

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,140
built into I mean just off the top of my

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,089
head computer-aided design animation

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:25,570
statistics research science those are

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,460
four fields where people are going to be

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,620
finding Python popping out of their

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,450
software products and if you want to

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,980
script your your software product you

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:38,170
may well end up doing it in Python so

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,380
the $25 raspberry pi computer that was

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:44,140
recently announced basically shows just

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,030
how low the cost of getting started in

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,220
Python can be and it means that we're

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,980
likely if things go well to actually see

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,780
new generations leaving school with

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,630
pison skills already and that's going to

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,120
be you know if you think 20 200s a lot I

00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,100
don't it probably won't be app icon but

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,329
I'm sure there'll be larger groupings of

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,019
Python programmers

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:08,679
in the future so as far as the Python

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,869
software foundation goes the psf has two

00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,269
principal duties right one is to promote

00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:16,029
protect and advance the Python

00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:19,149
programming language and the second is

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:22,600
to support and fertility facilitate the

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:24,100
growth of the international community of

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,869
Python programmers and I think you can

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,629
see by looking around you that we have

00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,999
actually taken the second goal very very

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,069
seriously indeed the first goal

00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,739
particularly the advancement is is more

00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:38,499
to do with the developers it also means

00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:39,519
three we run an amazing conference but

00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:43,869
nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,519
so we'll just stay at two so I didn't

00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,860
really expect when I became the chairman

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,170
of the psf that I'd soon be managing an

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,199
organization that had lost over half its

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,779
reserves on a single event that was a

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,639
distinct blow it meant that we had to go

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,189
into consolidation mode put certain

00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,889
plans on hold but I'm happy to say that

00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:04,899
through careful husbandry cautious

00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,929
planning and of course the help of both

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:10,589
Jessie and van Lindberg are proceeding

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:12,789
Pikkon chairman we have actually now

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,709
replenished those lost reserves and I'm

00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,000
happy to be able to tell you that the

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:20,069
foundation is on a better financial

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,069
footing than it ever has been before

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,350
so even when our funding was relatively

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,200
limited which it has been until recently

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,660
we found ways to try to help local and

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,970
national user groups and we continue to

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,070
treat increased diversity and in

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:45,300
particular increased gender diversity as

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,640
a very high priority the PI ladies who

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,590
were represented first of all by Audrey

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,910
Roy you just see receiving it just seen

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,250
receiving an award they're doing a

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,260
terrific job attracting more warning to

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,820
the Python community they are to be

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,710
applauded for that we cannot afford to

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,230
relax our efforts but I think at least

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,210
the Python community is being seen to

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,360
take these issues seriously which is

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:08,220
very very important indeed right now so

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,440
we've also done a few improvements on

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,270
our infrastructure we're looking to beef

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,980
up on our web and the rest of our

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,900
infrastructure because as the community

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,240
grows it's definitely going to come

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,190
under increasing pressure we've had

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,070
amazing support from hewlett-packard and

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,450
Dell we're very grateful to our hosting

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,110
partners access for all in the

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,270
Netherlands soon OSU OSL in the USA for

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,670
the assistance that they continue to

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,170
give us we're also looking to adopt

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,120
technology that will in some ways

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:40,440
democratize the web space that we

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,380
maintain the foundation has doesn't have

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,840
the ability to exercise central control

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,310
over the web with a community of the

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,800
size that the Python community has grown

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,230
to and we don't have the wish to control

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,240
it centrally either the only way we feel

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,990
to get a vibrant web is by having

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,430
community members put put information on

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,000
the the site about what they're doing

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:05,040
and basically we feel that the web

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,840
should be much more open to direct

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,480
community input and I hope that that's a

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,840
change that you'll see taking place in

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,540
the the next year I did actually with

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,150
the board delegated the the preparation

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,250
of the request for proposals to a guy

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,200
called Jesse NOLA and he's not come back

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,280
with the the finished RFP I can't

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,550
imagine what's been taking his time up

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,500
so another another initiative this one

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,320
by marc-andre lemberg and other of our

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,420
directors is to produce a python

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,950
brochure and so we have a python

00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,559
brochure coming up now

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,510
we're close I think to the the

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,760
pre-production stages and I believe we

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:48,389
may even have some pre-production

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,220
samples of the the brochure so if you

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:52,679
want your if you want to advertise your

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,200
company or if you simply want to be a

00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,450
case study you have advantages you have

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,850
opportunities to do both of those things

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,039
and I'm happy to say that the intention

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,590
is this brochure will not be funded out

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,450
of psf funds the intention is that the

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,789
advertising and the sponsorship for the

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,029
brochure will pay for it so it's almost

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:13,830
like getting something for nothing so

00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,840
we've had sponsor members in the

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,899
foundation that is people who actually

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,000
pay to join their the organizations that

00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:25,440
believe in and have often made a

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,059
significant investment in Python the

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,590
annual fees that they pay help to keep

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,440
the foundation going and we're very very

00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:34,260
grateful indeed to them I hope that the

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,870
size of the expo hall indicates that we

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,389
might in expect an influx of new sponsor

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,610
members in the coming year and I'll try

00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:43,919
to remember to ask them as I go around

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,200
the expo this morning if they'd like to

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,289
become sponsor members of the foundation

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,470
Oh which reminds me if anybody does

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:55,080
happen to feel particularly generously

00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:00,389
disposed towards the Python Software

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:03,360
Foundation I and Jesse and Jacob Kaplan

00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:06,269
moss and one other person we all have

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,519
not only are our cell phones with us but

00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,929
we also have a little a little widget

00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,029
called the square which you may have

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:15,450
seen from so basically we are able to

00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:17,850
take care sourabh credit card donations

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,590
for the foundation of up to two hundred

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,240
and fifty dollars so if you feel that

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,820
you haven't actually paid enough to the

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:29,240
foundation yet open your wallet and

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:32,010
repeat after me help yourself okay so

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,330
pikkon is sponsored by an enormous

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,340
number of companies some of whose

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,460
banners you can see at the the side of

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,350
the hall here I asked the audiovisual

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,710
team if they could let me for this talk

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,539
have a copy of the sponsors slide silly

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,220
me of course now we can't get all our

00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,379
sponsors on a single slide we've got

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,860
this five slideshow which keeps running

00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:51,860
during the

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,300
absolutely oh yeah it is a lot of work

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,880
it is a lot of work the fact the fact

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,160
that we've got so many slides full of

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,110
sponsors of courses is directly due to

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,690
jesse's efforts and he certainly put

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,660
anything that I ever did to bring money

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,670
into pycon well into the shade our

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,530
sponsorships actually very loyal one of

00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,990
this year's sponsors has sponsored

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,930
almost every PyCon since the first one

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,250
that we ran in 2003 when there was

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,580
actually time to read all the sponsors

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,500
names out without any problems at all so

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,600
I'd like to welcome sponsors

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,580
particularly the sponsors who a new tip

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,410
icon I'd like to thank them all for

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,620
making this a truly stupendous

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,630
conference possible and I hope that

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,340
you'll thank them all by visiting their

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,080
exhibition stands and talking to them

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,480
about why they're here at PyCon and what

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,930
they're trying to do I always maintained

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,460
that the best way to get sponsor support

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,200
was for the foundation to become worthy

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,420
of that support and I we've put a lot of

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,880
hard work in over the last three years I

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,220
think that the the size of the expo hall

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,910
is probably an indication that that

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:02,330
strategy has has worked so really the

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,550
idea behind Pikkon is is to try to help

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,010
create community because community and

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,230
open source or two important partners

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,390
they will not exist together I don't

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,890
think I'm a great one for putting myself

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,300
at people's in people's faces at PyCon

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:20,210
and in one of my conversations yesterday

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,490
I heard myself say if you aren't

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,190
enjoying pycon you aren't doing it right

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,780
that is very definitely the case you're

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,640
supposed to enjoy here and that actually

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,220
pretty much sums up my philosophy of

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,110
learning and I refuse to believe that

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,760
you can spend a week at PyCon and not

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:39,620
come away with a shitload of useful

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:43,280
information so i came across a trade

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:47,240
paper interview with me from 1984 yes i

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,670
have been in the industry since 1967 and

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,200
in a recent move i came across this

00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,610
interview where they chose a quote from

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,220
the interviews the headline and the

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:58,580
quote was if computing ever stops being

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,310
fun I'll stop doing it but in the body

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,500
of the text I said that for me computing

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,010
was all about people and I've done my

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,630
best to

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,960
try to make sure that Python does stay

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,580
fun and okay given that we had dancing

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,280
robots maybe it doesn't need to be all

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,140
people but when I saw those dancer when

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,340
I saw those dancing robots I'll tell you

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,470
that was that was an emotional moment

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,990
when I saw that PyCon had had really

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,080
grown up to the stage where where it

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:28,160
could provide that kind of an opening so

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,200
it's very easy in today's disjointed

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,360
society to feel that you don't matter to

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,360
anybody and there's no need to care

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,000
about anybody else I believe sometimes

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,600
we tell ourselves this lie in modern

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,420
society because if we were to expose it

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,100
as a lie we would also have to expose

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,440
our emotions and that's actually quite a

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,670
dangerous thing to do with people that

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:55,250
you can't trust but no man is an island

00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:57,080
so we need to learn to offer each other

00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,900
safe spaces where we can express

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,940
ourselves creatively not meet with

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,670
disapproval for being ourselves we're

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,370
finding new ways here to forge links

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:10,550
that have always been needed in whole

00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,830
integral integrated lives but with the

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,310
fragmentation of society and we're

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,840
actually at the forefront of finding new

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,640
electronic ways to replace the sense of

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,590
community that the the creation of

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,000
modern societies is actually fragmented

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:30,500
somehow so when people are making

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,660
history they don't often know it Paul

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,810
Graham statement yesterday that Pikkon

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,960
is the center not at the center but the

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:41,270
center of Silicon Valley this week

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,890
completely floored me I suppose that

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,800
there might actually be life after the

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,450
psf chairmanship after all but if the

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,210
success of the Python community in

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,990
recent years proves anything at all it

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,150
proves that hard work works and that

00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,830
teams can work successfully across

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,080
international boundaries but of course

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:04,610
we learned that from the developers so

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,790
it's no surprise to us so really that's

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,710
all I have to say to you if I can leave

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,960
you the portion of the Python community

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,180
lucky enough to be the center of Silicon

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,360
Valley for a week with any thoughts at

00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,910
all then these three thoughts

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,429
quite hard to go wrong with and in fact

00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:24,610
it's hard to think of a context in which

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,080
they won't help so enjoy the rest of the

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,980
conference and thank you very much

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,980
