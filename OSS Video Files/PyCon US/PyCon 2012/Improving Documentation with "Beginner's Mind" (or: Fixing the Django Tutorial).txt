Publication date: 2012-04-29
Playlist: PyCon 2012
Description: 
	Karen Rustad
This talk evaluates a well-known free software tutorial (the official Django tutorial) from the perspective of a web development novice in order to point out omissions and common sticking points and suggest improvements. More generally,

1 it's one-thirty so we'll get started

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,480
this is improving documentation with

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,219
beginner's mind by Karen rushed at this

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,740
is a 30 minute talk including five

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:24,140
minutes Q&A at the end let's welcome can

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:27,990
understand um hi everyone I'm Karen and

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm a grad student at UC Berkeley I'm

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,050
also on the board of open hatch which is

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,940
a nonprofit about doing outreach and

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,320
making open source projects friendlier

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,110
to newcomers and so giving a talk on how

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,350
to write beginner-friendly docs so at

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,850
last year's PyCon jacob kappa Moss gave

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,539
a lovely talk on writing good

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,620
documentation that i am going to steal

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,109
from here the in his talk he had a slide

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,730
about the six audiences and purposes

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,409
that documentation serves so we have

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,360
documentation for first contact which is

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,320
trying to answer the question what is

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,900
this thing and why do I care education

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,119
how do I better use this thing support

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,540
why it's answering the question why does

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,299
my why doesn't my thing work

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:29,790
troubleshooting pretty similar why

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:31,890
doesn't my freaking thing work internals

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,930
so for contributors how do I get

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,780
involved in this project how do i add on

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,729
to it and then finally reference

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,710
documentation which is answering

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,020
questions like how does that thing work

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,000
again the kind of stuff that no one

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,619
remembers so of these six my talk today

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,579
is going to be focusing on the first

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,460
thing just for context specifically

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,170
documentation targeted at new users so

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,450
when you're writing documentation

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,369
there's really two areas of

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,759
documentation that are the most

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,129
important first your installation and

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,830
setup instructions and your tutorials

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,599
and the reason for that is if these are

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,500
bad newcomers are going to be

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,690
discouraged though

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,250
I'll not know what's due and they'll

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,820
just never even see the rest of your

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,380
documentation so that makes these extra

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,730
important just because otherwise the

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,690
rest of your stuff just doesn't count

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:35,430
yeah so what makes a good tutorial good

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:37,800
well there's four factors um first what

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,580
a good tutorial advertises what about

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,650
the project is cool or unique or how it

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,360
relates within the ecosystem to other

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,739
similar libraries what does this thing

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,110
do that nobody else does second good

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,230
tutorials enjoyable it should be fun to

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,940
read it shouldn't be too long it doesn't

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,940
have to be super entertaining but it

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,170
should get to its point but people

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,980
should still enjoy going through it

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:10,380
three the tutorial steps should be have

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,170
a high likelihood of success so that

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,530
means being platform agnostic as far as

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,209
possible it means including all the

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,310
steps not leaving gaps where people

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,010
might not know what to do it means

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,299
testing the code and command snippets to

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,980
make sure they're still up to date and

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,840
haven't become defunct with the latest

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,459
version of the software things like that

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
because you want to make sure that when

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,519
people go through the thing and follow

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,370
the instructions you've given them

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,709
they're going to make it to the end and

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,870
finally a good tutorial is preparing the

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,810
reader not just you know to do the

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,880
tutorial but for using it this project

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,510
this library whatever it is for their

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,970
own projects and so these goals can

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,980
conflict what makes something great

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,930
advertising for a project it's not the

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,340
same thing necessarily is something that

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,340
prepares someone to actually build

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,980
something with it and concerns about

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,870
length and concerns about readability

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,110
all of these things sort of interplay

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,310
with one another going back to the

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,900
fourth factor that I like to note is one

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,340
thing to note about how newcomers use

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,950
tutorials and you probably know this

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,090
from your own use of them is that yeah

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,650
the first time you go through this

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,390
tutorial you actually follow the

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,669
tutorials instructions and build

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,730
whatever sample application or sample

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,960
what have you that the tutorial builds

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,030
but then what you do is you go back and

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,610
you follow the steps of the tutorial to

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,590
build your first project so newcomers

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,790
use tutorials as scaffolds what for

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,790
whatever it is they came to your project

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,170
in the first place to work on and so

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,450
being aware of that when you're writing

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,360
your tutorial making sure that it's not

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,430
just something that works these steps in

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,050
order but actually is a good example for

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,850
how newcomers are going to start their

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,470
projects is an important thing to keep

00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:01,170
in mind so for the rest of this i'm

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,440
taking the django tutorial as a case

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,710
study for the rest of this for a number

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,810
of reasons um why is Django it has good

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,260
docks it has a reputation for having

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,330
good good docs Jacob gave the

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,600
documentation last year of course and

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,190
knows everything about this and also

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,110
Django is the project that I use the

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,700
most in my free software work so I'm

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,850
pretty familiar with it and so I've

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,810
created two personas two people

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,060
fictional people who are going through

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,120
the Django tutorial trying to use it to

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,130
get kick-started on their own projects

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,170
to learn how to use Django for their own

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:45,930
stuff so person number one is a person

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,630
named kira she's a CS undergrad she

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,040
already knows Python and a bunch of

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,200
libraries with it pretty experienced

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,570
with it but hasn't done web dev before

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,540
and has some sort of web app that she

00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:01,470
wants to build a persona number two is

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,300
Kevin who is primarily designer has done

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,260
some intro Python tutorials knows the

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,410
basics and wants to get up to speed for

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,790
working with Django and his new job and

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,140
just is generally curious about learning

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:17,910
more about web development so what we're

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,150
going to do next is go through the

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,490
Django tutorial step by step do just do

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,130
a run-through and point out all the

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,300
places where our two fictional users

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,570
might get stuck or misled or confused

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,060
and otherwise not know what to do next

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,290
so it's worth noting here that some of

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,840
the issues i'm going to point out have

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,529
actually been fixed there have been some

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,679
updates the

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,299
tutorial which is great so I'll just

00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:47,699
pretend those aren't there for the

00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,169
purposes of learning um yeah so some of

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,099
these issues aren't there anymore some

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:54,959
still are that's fine anyway so the

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,329
beginning of the Jenga torial here's the

00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,119
what it looks like on the website but

00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,739
there's really a step zero before this

00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:03,419
installation obviously comes first you

00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:05,459
can't do the tutorial if you don't have

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,929
Django on your machine and that's where

00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:11,699
we run into our first bit of a hiccup

00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:13,319
installation hygiene all of the

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,449
installation instructions on jegos

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:20,099
website have you installed a package

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:22,529
site-wide now why is that bad well if

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,269
you've done development with Django or

00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:26,879
other things we've got multiple projects

00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:29,159
going at once and so maybe one website

00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,709
is using still using Django 1.2 and

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,059
others using 1.4 maybe you've got the

00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,219
development version for some reason for

00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:36,599
some other thing you want to be able to

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,889
isolate those from each other otherwise

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,769
you're not gonna be able to run them all

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,679
together on your machine at least in any

00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:47,009
clean easy way and so using things like

00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:48,659
pip and virtual end to I salute these

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,249
things from each other or using another

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,279
mechanism for doing that is really

00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,239
important but if you're a beginner

00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,439
you're not going to know about any of

00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:57,739
those resources you're not going to know

00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,139
that this is the best practice to

00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:03,119
isolate different different development

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,099
environments from one another and and

00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:10,949
the jenga website isn't going to tell

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:13,469
you to do that yeah so continuing starts

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,719
the tutorial and the first thing we do

00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:21,299
is create a django project called my

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:23,129
site and we sync the database we

00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:26,059
discover the development server that's

00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:29,039
pretty cool somewhere along these lines

00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:31,019
hopefully we'll be able to run through

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,240
the tutorial cleanly but sooner or later

00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:35,699
we're going to run into a bug that just

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,919
reading the code isn't going to be

00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:40,110
obvious on how to fix it and if you're a

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,939
newcomer you may not know about some of

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,699
the resources there are for debugging

00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:47,429
either in general or for Django specific

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,610
so Kevin definitely probably doesn't

00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:52,589
know about PDB yet definitely doesn't

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,420
know about the Django debug tool bar

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,100
which if you don't

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
if what you aren't really from already

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,970
familiar with that will save your life

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:05,790
insanity and not having access to those

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,050
resources if he runs into a problem it's

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,160
going to be really hard from to figure

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,779
out what to do next Kiera similarly also

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,100
doesn't know where to get help from a

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:20,010
human when she runs into a problem or

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,910
even just like a conceptual issue where

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,949
who can she ask for help and so knowing

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,470
about things like the genco IRC channel

00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:30,779
or the Django users mailing lists and

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,130
having a really prominent link on the

00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:36,930
tutorial documentation to those

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:40,889
resources is super important so we

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,829
create our first jingo app polls and so

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,540
here one thing that for a long time the

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:48,420
tutorial didn't really explain it was

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,320
the distinction between a project and a

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,510
nap with in Django and so it was easy to

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,100
assume that you should just put all your

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,769
code inside this app and the distinction

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,300
didn't really matter that's not what

00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,279
you're supposed to do what you're

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,620
supposed to do is have each subset of

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,870
functionality each app should reflect

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,550
one function of your website and then

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,310
they work together that results in

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,600
cleaner code it makes it easier to pop

00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,970
things in and out makes things more

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,190
modular but you're not going to learn

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:21,000
that from the tutorial and so you see a

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,680
lot of beginner beginning Django sites

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,120
but just cram all their code into one

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,550
place and have it really messy and

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,600
impossible to disentangle just because

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,600
they don't know this from the beginning

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:37,769
also with apps the idea of code reuse

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,380
the fact that there's a Django package

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,880
index that if you're trying to build

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,620
something Django it probably already

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,019
exists in some form or another there

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,930
that can be really useful now for

00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,220
newcomers like newcomers love to

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,740
reinvent the wheel that's what they'll

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,139
do fault to do because they don't know

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,779
what is out there and sometimes that's

00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,970
okay writing your own blog or writing

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,110
your own wiki or all these other pieces

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,790
of software that have already been

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,319
written doing it yourself as a learning

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,930
experience and there's nothing wrong

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,160
with that but doing it just because you

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,310
don't know what's out there

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,829
the user class yourself writing comments

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,779
yourself instead of being aware that you

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,430
can use code that other people have

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:21,149
written and is better than yours will be

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:28,589
and has been tested that something

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:32,459
people should know yeah after we've

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:34,379
created our django app in the we then

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,899
have a list of files that the app

00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,870
generator created so there's an init of

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:45,839
course models pi be used up high etc and

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:48,089
then there's this other thing a test dot

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,860
pi and it's just kind of listed there

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,990
and then the tutorial keeps going and

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,319
never discusses what this file is for

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,509
and so if you've already heard the

00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:59,399
gospel of test-driven development you'll

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,170
you can guess what tests up high is for

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,689
the okay that's where you put your unit

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,519
tests and why not so you can do

00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,540
test-driven development but if you

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,970
aren't already familiar with that

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,889
concept you're probably just going to

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,709
gloss over it just like the tutorial did

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:15,689
never even open it and then you won't

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,120
have tests which is really tragic for a

00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:20,339
tutorial because having tests is a great

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,560
learning tool having tutorials where you

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,300
provide them with a test file to begin

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,009
with and then as they go through the

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,550
tutorial more and more tests pass is a

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:31,800
great way to have people see their

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,870
progress as they go and also teach them

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,870
these best practices with testing first

00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:42,389
keeping going so yes what we create our

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,079
models we have our poll model and her

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,730
choice model in the tutorial and we add

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,579
the application in our settings and we

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,800
sync the database again and sooner or

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,149
later we're going to hit the biggest

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,100
gotcha that I'm probably going to

00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,540
present which is schema migrations no

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,670
one gets their models right the first

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,170
time especially as a beginner you're

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,759
always going to be editing them and

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,220
tweaking them and changing the options

00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,629
on the various fields and given

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,809
eventually you're going to hit something

00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:15,839
that just running sync DB is not going

00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:17,519
to work and the really tragic thing

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,220
about this is that when you hit that

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,790
point um your eye

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,829
sorry when you hit that point you can't

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,699
just then discover magically discover

00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:32,230
south somehow and have migrations and be

00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,110
happy again because you're going to

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,329
revert whatever changes broke everything

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:41,939
or start over in order to have south

00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:43,870
track your application so the fact that

00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:45,370
migrations aren't even mentioned in the

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,199
tutorial that's probably the biggest

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,279
thing that newcomers run into when

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,649
actually trying to build their own

00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:52,120
Django application is that suddenly they

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,649
can't edit their models anymore and they

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,939
don't know why if they haven't worked

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,009
with databases before if they haven't

00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:58,420
worked with sequel before or migrations

00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:03,639
before this is all going to be

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:06,730
completely new and unexpected page two

00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,439
is all about the admin that there's an

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,389
admin app and that's kind of cool and

00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:13,149
also customizing the admin app in

00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:16,060
various ways which if you're building a

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:20,649
newspaper application is pretty useful

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:23,589
if you're not it's really not and the

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:25,089
amount of coverage that the admin guest

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:30,129
just seems like kind of like an

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:32,620
interruption within the tutorial you

00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:36,459
write your URLs interviews you write

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:39,009
your first templates and thrill of this

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,750
it's all been we've got this admin

00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,610
back-end that you can edit stuff on and

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,800
then you've got a URL that if you ping

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,079
the URL that's a vote but there's no

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,610
real user facing crud which stands for

00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,430
create read update and delete operations

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,139
and someone like Kevin who does user

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,019
experience design that's his bread and

00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,059
butter that's what he expects a web app

00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:04,750
to be is something user-facing where you

00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:07,720
have things like comments and

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,110
user-generated content you have things

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,850
like ajax all these things that work and

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,980
right now the tutorial isn't telling

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,110
them how to do it which makes it easy to

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:22,300
assume that this just doesn't exist or

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:25,809
is really hard the in the new version

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,970
instead of voting via URL we have a form

00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:31,110
which is okay except for it doesn't

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,339
Django has a built-in forms object that

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,899
does lots of useful things for you like

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,240
cleaning data

00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:40,480
stuff like that the tutorial doesn't use

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,699
its own built-in for handling the form

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,119
and that seems a little bit of an

00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:48,209
oversight and if you happen to find out

00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:50,529
about forms and model form specifically

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,420
the documentation there doesn't tell you

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,850
how to style the forms things like

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,459
making the form appear within paragraphs

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:02,619
versus in a table versus in a list and

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,119
that makes them really hard to style I

00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,639
didn't even know about a lot of these

00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:09,819
features until the deep dive on forms

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,610
yesterday that Nathan gave and I've been

00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:13,360
working with Django for years so

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:17,499
newcomers definitely aren't going to

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,089
just discover this ah yeah and then Ajax

00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:23,920
again also not part of the tutorial and

00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,689
then finally at the end there's a bit of

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,029
coverage of generic views that's kind of

00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:30,610
cool and we're at the end of this

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,369
tutorial but but but there's so many

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,189
more things that a basic web application

00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,959
is probably going to care about oh and

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:41,019
then there's this what's next like now

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:45,459
which is great and awesome but didn't

00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:47,939
used to be there anyway so one thing we

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:51,370
might care about when building a basic

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:54,429
Django application is static and media

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,350
files having a CSS stylesheet so you can

00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:59,769
make your web app pretty having images

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:02,350
of any sort either uploaded or ones that

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,539
are just part of the website and that's

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,339
not explained to the tutorial at all and

00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,589
the distinction between static and media

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,120
can be kind of confusing so it's a

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,679
little bit of a shame that that's not

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,689
explicitly covered their template

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,909
inheritance all the templates in the

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:23,500
tutorial are just standalone templates

00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:26,649
copy and paste that's not so great you

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,419
what you want to do is have things

00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:29,799
inherit so that you're not copying

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:31,740
pasting your header over and over again

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,289
and every time you change something

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,970
having a giant headache and Kevin as a

00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:40,750
designer probably knows well enough that

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:42,940
that ought to exist yeah and then

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,909
finally showing off having deployment

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,730
options that are easier than setting up

00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:50,169
apache and setting up this whiskey nonce

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,990
that you may or may not have worked with

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,760
before if you've never done web app

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,870
development of any sort you're

00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,799
definitely never going to have seen this

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,809
stuff before have it being aware of

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,120
things like platform-as-a-service stuff

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:06,760
that support Django like Heroku and

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,740
Django zoom and stuff like that so that

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,570
you can easily show off hey I made this

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,630
really stupid cool web app for the first

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,580
time let me show my friends is one of

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,290
the more rewarding aspects of learning

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,730
to program and that's something that you

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:23,620
want to make easy yeah so it's worth

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,900
asking the question here at this point

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,270
but most of the issues here aren't

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,429
strictly Django they're more best

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,210
practices or other things in sort of the

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,860
web app ecosystem so why should the

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,040
Django tutorial care about them why is

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,100
it its responsibility to teach and it's

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,740
a worthwhile question what is the

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,290
purpose of this tutorial going back to

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,440
the previous slide we've got these four

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:52,690
goals if our emphasis is mostly on goal

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,750
number one like advertising what makes

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,390
this project awesome then our target

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,309
audience is probably fairly experienced

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,770
web programmers already know best

00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,330
practices and they can compare with

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,700
other frameworks and so they don't need

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,580
as much background or as if we emphasize

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,130
number four then our target audience are

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:17,190
newcomers to web programming who we can

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:19,480
indoctrinate into the cult of Django so

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,720
the question is is your goal to build a

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,830
community or just build another library

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,660
and either answer is just fine but if

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,700
you do want your project to take over

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,510
the world you need to take the long view

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,620
and expect more from your tutorials and

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,940
their intro docks than you otherwise

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:43,210
would comprehensive tutorials are

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,730
possible the rails bridge tutorial which

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,950
is ostensibly a tutorial to learn Ruby

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,790
on Rails covers all of this other stuff

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,799
as well the pi-star version of the

00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,929
Django tutorial similarly took its cues

00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,990
from railsbridge and also covers all

00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,740
sorts of things from get to crud to

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,740
deployment

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,610
this is a version of the Tengu torial I

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,900
put together for an intro web

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,000
programming class that I taught last

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,890
semester that covered a lot of the

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,690
similar stuff as well including things

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,850
like Ajax since the students in the

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:17,750
class were more familiar with JavaScript

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,190
and front-end development yeah so a

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,870
disadvantage of this approach with

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,880
comprehensive tutorials is that they are

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,250
longer it takes more work to write them

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,350
but you can mitigate that somewhat by

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,210
making your tutorials have a modular

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,580
structure instead of just being one cube

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:35,180
beginning to end which Ruby on Rails

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,130
guides does pretty well and also even

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,340
just having links to other people's

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:43,460
stuff is a huge step even a link to a

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,750
Google search because newcomers don't

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,460
know the lingo they don't know what to

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,430
search for and blind searching is only

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,810
going to get you so far so introduced as

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,680
much as you can even if you can't go

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:56,630
into depth about it so do we want to

00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,310
write a tutorial at centro de django or

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,980
do we want to write intro to web

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,740
programming using django why not have

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,080
both documentation needs to serve

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,120
multiple masters as Jacob said last year

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,010
that's the whole point and so the same

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,200
material has to appear in places in

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,260
multiple ways to serve those different

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,530
audiences and that's fine so some

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,410
strategies common issues in intro Doc's

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,390
writing assuming familiarity with bash

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,700
is a big one assumptions about the

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,770
platform just having a list of

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,830
directions without saying why isn't very

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,270
good for teaching code samples that no

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,830
longer work because the software has

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,470
been updated since the tutorial was

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,870
written and finally not having an

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:42,410
obvious place to ask for help look for

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,900
those they're mighty common and then

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,500
strategies for writing better docs just

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,270
remember we were all newcomers wants and

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,160
just as the strength of a rationalist is

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,960
to notice that you are confused the

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,360
strengths of a good docs writer and

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,580
community manager is to notice your own

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,590
expertise and how your experience makes

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,320
it easier to be working on a given

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,920
project and compensated accordingly when

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,990
you're writing if you don't remember

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,240
what it was like to be a newcomer find a

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,100
newcomer and have them go through the

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,770
tutorial in front of you go to your

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,770
local

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,570
user group or other user group and watch

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,370
and see people try to get involved with

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,420
your stuff and take notes when they get

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:26,190
stuck include your docs in your test

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,860
framework if you're using Spanx it's

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,140
pretty simple to have your test runner

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,060
also run over the code inside your

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,350
documentation and so your code samples

00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,520
it'll tell you if they're no longer work

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,610
say who you're writing for the beginning

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,200
of is this is this tutorial meant for

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,960
absolute beginners who are just barely

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,210
know python or is it targeted a more

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,970
experienced group of people who know

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,070
more things having making your

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,440
dependencies explicit is important not

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:00,720
just for software but also for human

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,310
beings and almost finally having

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,480
different tutorials for different

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,510
audiences it's definitely key a tutorial

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,670
that is Django for zope refugees it's

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:16,800
going to look very different than that

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,050
welcome to the pony cult and so these

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:23,580
should be different documents in your

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:26,280
documentation base and yeah all of these

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,890
are hard it's a lot of work that's true

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,480
but at the very can't just do it

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,520
yourself file a bug and hopefully

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,440
someone else will also take care of this

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:42,050
burden for you yeah that's what I got

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,050
and onto the QA thank you very much

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,260
so we have five minutes for Q&A if

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,860
anyone of question please use this

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,260
microphone oh that I thanks for your

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,470
talk I was just curious if you have any

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,230
data on how often someone has installed

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,650
the package and then site wide and then

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,580
needed different versions of it for

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,720
different projects and like run into

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,350
that problem where they actually needed

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,360
a virtual end um I don't have any data

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,580
without like installing some key loggers

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,940
on an awful lot of new newcomers

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:23,030
computers i can say that i haven't

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,460
worked on a project that didn't end up

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,780
like i'm most familiar with virtual end

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,180
because every product i've been involved

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,550
with has advised that for how to keep

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,960
these dependencies straight they're

00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,820
probably other systems that other people

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,910
use to keep things straight like maybe

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:41,810
people even use whole virtual VMs to run

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,490
this stuff but i would i would be

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,400
surprised that you would do this for

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,740
more than a few years and not have some

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,940
things in the latest version of django

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,250
and other things still in whatever

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,980
version of django they started with when

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:58,240
the project began like that's kind of

00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,240
how these things tend to run

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,840
so I'm glad I'm glad you got to multiple

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,399
versions of tutorials for different

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,960
audiences because definitely during the

00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:13,549
first portion the talk I was thinking

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,250
about like well if she had already taken

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:19,250
the database class they wouldn't have

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:24,529
had that question but that leaves me

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:27,980
thinking where to start with mm-hmm and

00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:30,529
so for me as primarily a developer

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:35,419
because I don't have to go t I would

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:37,070
think well I'll start with the you know

00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:38,960
assuming that they're going to be

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:43,159
already familiar with the rest of the

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,259
environment and maybe write about stuff

00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,539
that's really specific to my project and

00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:51,259
maybe that can be like a modular kernel

00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:54,250
that somebody else can refer to yeah um

00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:56,779
that's perfectly fine and great I mean

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,120
the other it goes the other way to you

00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,590
wouldn't want to send a bunch of people

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,240
who have been doing web development for

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,830
10 years and makes them sit through

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,110
something that teaches them everything

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,909
from you no soup to nuts like of course

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,690
that's not being nice to your users

00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:13,519
either saying at the top of

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:16,789
documentation be like we assume that

00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,620
you're familiar with x y&z like this is

00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:21,529
generally what we're expecting and then

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,389
starting the tutorial is probably the

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:28,730
best way to make that explicit cuz

00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:30,799
otherwise people just don't know Karen

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,389
thanks for this talk this is partly sort

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,590
of a plug for something I care about but

00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:40,539
i'll try and phrase it as a question

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:43,909
great what thoughts do you have about

00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:47,659
useful balance between descriptive text

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:52,100
code samples and diagrams which seem to

00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:54,320
be in a pretty low supply I like them

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,629
all I would definitely agree with you on

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,330
the diagrams I mean I'm definitely a

00:26:56,629 --> 00:27:01,340
visual learner and so having you know

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,220
people have been trying to draw in

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,629
Django the MVC like separation and what

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,490
does that look like in Django and which

00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:08,899
part is which and people disagree about

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,929
this passionately which is probably part

00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:15,470
of why there is no diagram in the Django

00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:17,090
tutorial yeah I definitely advocate

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,380
having those I can understand why

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,600
they're a little bit more work to create

00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,760
especially if a person writing isn't

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,250
also someone who does graphical things

00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:31,490
but yeah that's definitely a good thing

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:33,080
to remind people of hello my name is

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,910
Lynn wrote and I'm actually trying to

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,240
start up piloting San Francisco so I

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,580
have a question find me but I am leading

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,740
a workshop in Python we're just getting

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,630
into Django and I had just learned

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,910
Django maybe a few months ago made my

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,560
own website and I went through the whole

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,270
process and I was like right I

00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,200
understand step-by-step what I need to

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:56,030
do but what the hell am i doing so it's

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,250
like a forest and a tree sort of thing

00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,350
so do you have advice for writing

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:05,720
tutorials and how to see like the forest

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:07,840
as well as the trees diagrams yeah

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,090
that's definitely one step having a

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,800
modular focus that you like the kernel

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,590
of everyone needs to know this in Django

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,900
to start and then people making their

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:22,090
path into the forest from there is one

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:24,410
nice thing to do beyond that though like

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,840
the unspoken part of this is that

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:30,260
written explicit docs will only get you

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,120
so far having at least one other human

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,190
you can ask stupid questions of will

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,110
make a life-and-death difference with

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,120
getting involved in a new project or

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:41,210
using a new library that you don't know

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,250
anything about yet so yeah like starting

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,580
a meetup and getting a bunch of other

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,830
Django learners or people of different

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:53,260
ability levels like that's also

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,260
definitely something to point to

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,390
okay so I noticed that you had created

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,600
sort of user personas for the

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,640
documentation which is I guess the point

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,410
how in depth do you like to go with

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,220
those personas like right down to the

00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:17,010
goatee or or what um I mean the goatee

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,520
is not essential uh the goatee does not

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:23,520
indicate progress that yeah I mean I

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,020
like drawing pictures of the people's

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,330
I'm sort of envisioning using stuff

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,130
that's my background is originally as a

00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,770
designer so I sort of come from that

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,870
perspective and because I can do i do

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,640
but that's obviously not necessary at

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,630
all you would not you do not need to

00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,020
draw a picture so you can have like a

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,460
little stick figures and still do this

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,200
stuff well and still have sort of

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,750
empathy for what people are going to go

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:52,110
through do you name always name your

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:55,340
personas that's a bad habit yes thank

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,340
