indentation error I told you a thousand

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,440
times that's because you are always

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,440
using Python

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,569
welcome to Pike in 2012 enjoy

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:25,300
all right good morning welcome for those

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:33,880
of you who don't know me I'm Jesse NOLA

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:35,320
I'm the conference chair just a quick

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,060
note about the robots we're actually

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,710
raffling one of those off on sunday

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,229
during the closing address the NAO robot

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,000
the elder barani robot guys were very

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:48,250
very kind and generous and bringing

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,039
these all the way over from france to do

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:55,300
the demo programmable in python I

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:57,510
thought it was pretty cool so just a few

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:03,750
announcements to kick off the conference

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:06,160
first off we have some stats here and

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,050
total attendance as of this morning is

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,050
over 2,000 257 people

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:23,539
admittedly we set the cap at 1500 but um

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,569
I was never very good at math we have

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,669
over 136 sponsors and partners and we

00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:32,569
issued 52 thousand dollars in financial

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:38,180
great grants and outreach that's just

00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:40,250
this year alone just some random statim

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,860
is going to gloss over these but let's

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,520
just say that it's worked out very very

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,169
well for this year the fact is that this

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,180
is the biggest Python conference in

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,580
history this is the probably the largest

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:56,750
gathering of Python hackers in history

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,250
and none of this would have been

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,280
possible without the Python Software

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,800
Foundation who actually hosts backs and

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,580
takes all the risk for this so all the

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,580
things go to them

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,350
I'd like to thank everyone here every

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,280
single one of you every single one of

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:24,460
you actually helps make this hike on all

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,500
the staff or volunteers please remember

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,660
to thank them every one you see running

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,060
a session chair everyone helping out

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,680
we're all volunteers and we're doing it

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,110
because it's a labor of love for all of

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,640
you you trust me looking at our crowd of

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,960
over 2,000 people it's well worth it

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:46,330
quick note we have a mobile guide if you

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,680
want to download it guidebook com you

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,290
can join the discussion we actually have

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,640
a real time discussion put a discussion

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:57,010
board put together by our friends at

00:06:51,640 --> 00:07:01,950
discuss go to the expo hall 136 sponsors

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:05,620
we have filled the expo hall filled it's

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,290
actually quite epic please go visit them

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,080
see what they have to say and thank them

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,890
because without them this would not have

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,990
been possible all the talks today and

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,720
tomorrow and Sunday are being recorded

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,700
and posted online speakers probably go

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,200
to the green room before the talk but

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,850
it'll be recorded so if you have

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,380
conflicts about what you want to go and

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,310

the expo hall we're actually having a

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,430
job fair where we have probably around

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,060
to the tune of 40 companies who will be

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,950
actively recruiting for Python positions

00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,760
so if you're looking for a job or if you

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,800
want to go and talk to them please come

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,060
is going to be in the same space as the

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:10,630
poster session we have a ton of special

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,610
events we've got a party tonight from

on 5k tomorrow at 7am so the first two

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,580
you should probably not go

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:27,640
overboard unless you do want me to win

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,810
because I will be running which at which

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,169
point you can feel free to do whatever

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,479
you want we've got the same path python

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,520
programming tournament we've got a pie

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,680

adding events as soon as I get back to

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,660
my laptop or rather as soon as I get off

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,290
of here I have to have update the mobile

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,570
guide and so remember to stay to the

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,960
closing address on Sunday we have a

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,970
robot seriously it involved customs

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,260
forms and a call from the Department of

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:04,510
Homeland Security and we have it I've

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,550
got it stored in a secure place where I

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:11,080
will not win it but it may fall off a

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:15,490
bus someplace on a personal note and I

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,280
won't take too long most of you know me

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,280
or many of you know me and many of you

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,640
know that this has been a labor of love

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,790
for me this conference more particularly

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:34,810
you know that this year has been fairly

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:36,310
rough for myself from my family we we've

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,480
been blessed with a second daughter her

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,190
name's Addison that's her it hasn't been

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,910
easy and my family has been going

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:49,300
through a lot of rough times and when we

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:53,260
were most in need and when things got

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,870
rough a lot of friends a lot of family

00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:02,170
and my co-workers all came in and helped

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:05,170
us out and give a support but people who

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,420
I know through just checking commit

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,680
rights emailing lists people here in

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:14,680
this room when we needed it they gave us

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,220
support they gave us cards they reached

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,410
out to our family and they helped us in

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:26,350
ways that I can't even begin to describe

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:31,170
and that's why I Ford so much this into

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,170
