another keynote this morning and then

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,970
we'll take a break our next keynote is

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,970
actually Paul Graham of Y Combinator

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,529
stage is full of robots something's

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,840
going on here

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,699
so a lot of you guys may be from out of

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,480
town boy this is a lot bigger than the

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,940
last PyCon I talked at know last time I

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,059
talked at PyCon was in 2003 I think it

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,280
was the second PyCon um and it was about

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,090
sort of the front half of that bit over

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,930
there the true believers um

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,410
the early converts so those of you guys

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,329
from out of town are probably wondering

00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,190
what Silicon Valley is like Silicon

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,559
Valley is a curious thing it doesn't

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,539
have an architectural center there's no

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,219
forum that is the center of Silicon

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,510
Valley the center of Silicon Valley

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,129
moves around it is wherever there is at

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,810
this moment the greatest concentration

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,840
of the people who are going to make the

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,939
next generation of stuff so you're

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,580
probably you're probably guessing where

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,150
I'm leading this is right now the center

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,650
Silicon Valley you are it so I hope

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,119
you're not disappointed because this is

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,380
the center of Silicon Valley right now

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,110
um in this talk I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,390
a curious phenomenon I've observed in

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,250
all these years I have been working on Y

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,030
Combinator and not on programming

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,700
languages um the frightening this of

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,500
very big start-up ideas very big startup

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,450
ideas are actually terrifying and the

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,240
way I'm going to demonstrate this is by

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,659
frightening you I'm going to give you a

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,909
list of seven gigantic startup ideas any

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,180
one of them is so big it could make you

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,619
a billionaire and at this point those of

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,360
you who are thinking maybe of one day

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,299
starting startups are waiting

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,040
expectantly by the way you don't have to

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,490
take notes I wrote this all down it's

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,780
going to be

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,239
the web is an essay you can just listen

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,060
um all the ideas are going to be in

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,770
there but if you're thinking of starting

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,890
a startup you're probably thinking to

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,080
yourselves alright here it comes

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,910
but you'll see when I say them you'll

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,380
find instead of embracing them

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,489
expectantly you'll be thinking maybe I

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,319
should do that recipes site after all um

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:31,319
don't worry it's not a sign of weakness

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,290
in fact arguably it is a sign of sanity

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,170
um the biggest startup ideas are

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,180
frightening and not just because they'd

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,680
seem like a lot of work the biggest

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,660
start-up ideas threaten your identity um

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,209
there's a scene in Being John Malkovich

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,819
anybody know that movie I highly

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,860
recommend that to hackers

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:54,420
we have a Malkovich room in Y Combinator

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,010
believe it or not there's like this half

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,950
floor up there that nobody knows about

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,720
it's the funniest thing um this is this

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,880
is not like the elevator pass it really

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,030
exists well there's a scene in Being

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,870
John Malkovich where our nerdy hero

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,290
probably difficult for you guys to

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,549
identify with but imagine um he

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,500
encounters this very beautiful

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:18,900
attractive woman and he's like um and

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,730
she says to him here's the thing if you

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,519
ever got me you wouldn't have a clue

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,100
what to do with me um and that's what

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,140
these really big ideas say to you um

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,880
this phenomenon is one of the most

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,320
important things you can under bet you

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,720
can understand about startups you'd

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,310
think really big startup ideas would be

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,190
attractive but actually they tend to

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,730
repel you um and so you need to learn

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,549
how to tack into that wind essentially

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,280
alright ready ok so suppose you want to

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:51,209
start the next Google let's start with

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,220
the most obvious idea um start the next

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,220
Google

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,530
the best ideas are right on just the

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,940
right side of impossible and it's hard

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,560
to judge at the point where you have

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,900
them whether they're on the right side

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,310
or the wrong side right so I'm telling

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,020
you a lot of these ideas I'm going to

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,930
suggest are going to seem seem kind of

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,570
impossible um

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,710
so making a new search engine to compete

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,989
with Google that sounds almost

00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,799
impossible but there are encouraging

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:24,400
signs um or discouraging signs if you

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,640
were a Google user the point where it

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,890
became clear to me that Microsoft really

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:34,180
lost their way was when they got into

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,190
the search business um so like that was

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,630
not a natural move for Microsoft why did

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,430
they do that they did that because they

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,990
were afraid of Google and Google was in

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,310
the search business they I think we got

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,590
to get in the search business search is

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,270
the future well you probably noticed

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:53,169
google has been getting into the social

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:56,680
network business lately mmm so maybe

00:04:53,169 --> 00:05:00,070
that's a sign of something um now the

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,470
mere fact that Google may have peaked is

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,160
not by itself doesn't doesn't by itself

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,610
prove that there's room for a new search

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,880
engine

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,010
however just lately like when I'm using

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,250
Google search I find I'm kind of

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,890
nostalgic for the old days when Google

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,350
was true to its own slightly ASPI self

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,729
and was like designed like a UNIX

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,830
utility that would just like give you

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,200
the right answers fast right and now

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,850
like the search results seem like

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,350
they're based on the Scientologists

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,070
principle that what's true is what's

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,070
true for you

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,690
I'm like the JavaScript man like I feel

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,260
like if I put my cursor in the wrong

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,540
place anything might happen I like I

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,070
feel like I am like I'm being a be

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,410
tested on right um so how do you win

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,660
here the way to win here the way to

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,520
attack all these really gigantic ideas

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,180
is to find the tiny thing that turns

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,080
into the gigantic idea right um find the

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,700
dinosaur egg the dinosaur egg I just

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,750
like invented a meme on the spot that

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,930
was not in the talk um the dinosaur egg

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,360
is to make a search engine that all the

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,240
hackers use if you just made a search

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,730
engine that the top 10,000 hackers used

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,340
and you got like the first 20 percent of

00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,170
them in this room right if you just made

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,030
a search engine that the top 10,000

00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,610
hackers used and nobody else you'd have

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,250
only 10,000 users right talk about

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,590
paltry and yet you would be in a very

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,750
powerful position just as Google was

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,080
when they had those first 10,000 users

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,350
so make a search engine for hackers the

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,420
good news is if you are if you are

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,060
capable of doing this startup idea you

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,100
are one of those 10,000 hackers right so

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,930
the solution is make the search engine

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,000
you yourself one this is a case where

00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,110
it's it's good to be self-indulgent you

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,460
want to make your search ends your

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,680
search queries turing-complete

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,240
go for it right you want to make it like

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,340
really good for code search at the

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,500
expense of everything else fine don't

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,240
worry about doing something initially

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,650
that will constrain you in the long term

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,060
because if you don't win in the short

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,610
term there won't be a long term anyway

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,650
so call it hacks or search or something

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,450
like that and like make the search

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,010
queries make the UI really hard to use

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,040
it doesn't matter if you get those first

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,110
10,000 people you're like 5% of the way

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,670
to an IPO just like Facebook was when

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,840
they got all the Harvard undergrads even

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,640
though they probably didn't realize it

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,590
at the time okay number two um replace

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,360
email by the way a lot of these ideas

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,330
there are people already nibbling at the

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
round at the edges off any big

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,569
dia has a bunch of people nibbling at

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,099
the edges of it they just don't realize

00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:47,220
how big the piece of cheese they're

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:50,490
nibbling at the edges of our um email

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,199
was not designed to be used the way we

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,419
use it now it was designed for like guys

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,189
in a one card we're at Bell Labs to send

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,419
one another a message saying like want

00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:03,419
to go to lunch um I hear they have you

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,860
know sausages in a Bell Labs cafeteria

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:10,560
um but email is not a messaging protocol

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,509
it's a to-do list right or at least my

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,330
inbox is a to-do list and email is the

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:18,000
protocol for putting stuff on it here's

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,159
the problem it is a shitty to-do list

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
any one of you can put something on my

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,919
to-do list

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,460
right and I don't want that so I'm open

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,199
it's different yeah I'm open to

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,240
different solutions to this problem but

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,620
I suspect tweaking the inbox it's not

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,750
going to be enough you're going to have

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,729
to make a new protocol it can like

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,709
degrade to the old protocol but I think

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,380
you should make a to-do list protocol

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:45,899
instead of a messaging protocol and as a

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,910
messaging protocol it ought to give more

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,130
power to the recipient I ought to be

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,529
able to control who can put things in my

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,540
inbox when someone can't put something

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,339
in my inbox I should just my server

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,980
should just say sorry not accepting any

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,630
more things right not like I send

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,980
another message back to them using the

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,750
protocol saying sorry I'm not oh I'm

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,699
away now right like the away message

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,529
it's like so obviously a sign that

00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:13,699
something is wrong more how about like

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:15,959
sending emails to yourself um um okay so

00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:17,790
like I want to know more about this

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,079
thing not just like who it came from and

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,930
when I want to know like what somebody

00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,490
actually wants me to do I want to give

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,899
people different ability to tell me to

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,430
do different things I want them to tell

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,990
me you like do they want me to do more

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,279
than just read some text am I supposed

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,079
to do something in the physical world

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,370
when does it have to be done by when at

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,110
which point can this thing just

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,390
disappear because it's too late you know

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,910
God knows how many like conference

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:43,980
invitations I have from like 2007 and my

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,120
deep buried down in my inbox this is one

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,100
of these ideas that's like an

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,800
irresistible force meeting an immovable

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,450
object on the one hand entrenched

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,670
protocols are impossible to

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,020
this place on the other hand I just do

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,730
not want to believe that people in the

00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,390
future are going to be living in the

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,770
same email hell that we do now um so if

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,050
it's going to get replaced eventually

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,930
why not now right I'm ready

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,880
um if you do this here's an interesting

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,240
one friend of mine was an early employee

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,870
at Google um you know he's rich that's

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,100
what that means

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,480
um hey seriously when in the valley if

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,630
you're not from the valley like early

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,420
Google employee is like a some sort of

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,130
code word for rich um so I asked him if

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,630
he's like if he could still stand

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,980
working at Google now that he was rich

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,540
and he didn't have to and he said

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,720
actually it was pretty he didn't really

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,330
have any problems except he got so much

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,770
email right um and this guy is like one

00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,990
of the most powerful people at Google

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,180
like powerful people are in pain because

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,830
of email right um and whenever powerful

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,630
people are in pain that is an

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,600
opportunity to make lots of money so if

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,520
you build this thing some of the most

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,410
powerful people in the world will be the

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,910
first to use it like they don't care if

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,290
it interacts well with other protocols

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,580
they'll say you want to put something on

00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,560
my to-do list you're not sending me

00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,490
email you got to use this um so you

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,050
don't have to worry about a

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:05,250
chicken-and-egg problem right there you

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:09,000
have a dinosaur chicken um whatever you

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,790
build make it fast gmail has gotten

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,190
painfully slow by the way the original

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,360
version of that sentence was gmail is

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,870
painfully slow

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,630
I owe my partner Paul Buchheit um for

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,490
correcting me there hmm gmail has become

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,320
painfully slow if you just made

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,540
something like the same as Gmail but a

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,790
lot faster you could start to pull users

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,680
away from Gmail with just that people

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,200
will pay for this I would have no

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,700
problem paying $50 a month in fact when

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,290
I think about how much time I spend an

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,590
email like that's probably one of the

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,270
things I'm most in denial about um like

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,030
it would probably probably justified

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,710
paying $1,000 a month for this if you

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,850
know if it would make me better if it

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,200
would make my life better that'll be

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,760
like the probably the lowest hanging

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,480
fruit and making my life better

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,870
um all right number three replace

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,280
universities now this this is an idea

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,280
people are all over lately

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:10,300
boy it just occurred to me this is an

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:16,090
instance there of right um hackerspaces

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:18,850
yeah with Malkovich rooms I am reluctant

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,620
to suggest that an institution that's

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,570
been around for over a millennium is

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,680
going to disappear just because of some

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,660
mistakes they have made in the last

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,640
couple decades but certainly in the last

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,840
couple decades universities seem to be

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,640
heading down the wrong path

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,080
you know they've they're like not fun

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,540
for the students or the professors

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,630
they've turned into like expensive

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:42,820
country clubs um where you don't learn a

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:44,440
lot you study abroad um I don't think

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,060
universities will disappear

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,160
I think they'll I don't think they'll be

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,140
replaced wholesale they'll be replaced

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,850
by a whole bunch of little things that

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,010
sort of serve ala carte what those

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,260
monolithic four years what those

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,460
monolithic four years did many of them

00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,900
will look different from what

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,280
universities look like people won't

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,730
realize they're being replaced like

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,460
people will learn stuff right and that

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,020
that's how they will be replaced

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,790
arguably Y Combinator is one of one

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,640
instance of this this is this is an

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,990
instance of it um learning is such a big

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,520
problem that if you change the way

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,080
people do it it will also have a wave of

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,210
secondary effects for example

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,640
universities are now for better or worse

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,590
sort of a credential like where you went

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,510
to college people ask you that fairly

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,670
early on in conversations

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,110
if universities go away like maybe

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,380
credentialing has to be supplied

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,090
separately you could replace high

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,960
schools that would probably be even

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,790
better but with high schools you face

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,380
all kinds of bureaucratic obstacles and

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,640
you don't want to do things in a

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,860
start-up you want to deal with stuff

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,510
that's going to slow you down so don't

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:51,370
go for high schools first go for

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:56,880
universities um okay number four

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,880
kill Hollywood mm I'll give a few more

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,210
here's a few more details about what

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,950
that would involve because by the way

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,110
that whole kill Hollywood thing that was

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,880
Paul boo kites idea that was not my idea

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,950
really you guys should give him credit

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,380
for that um and if there's any hitmen

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,010
from the RIAA like definitely Paul

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,070
Buffay

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,740
that's credit for that one um I just

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,970
wrote the RFS in fact PV was kind of

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,730
amused because we were like having lunch

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,740
one at one afternoon um and he said you

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,100
know we should like have an RFS for like

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,840
people to replace the UM the big studios

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,460
and I said all right and so I wrote this

00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,810
RFS and he's like the next day is like

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:39,200
Jesus Christ that was just an idea

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:41,670
yesterday and now it's a meme um so

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,940
Hollywood Hollywood's big mistake well

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,710
one of many um was to be slow to embrace

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,960
the internet and that was a big mistake

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,670
because I think just a you know you can

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,410
call a winner early sometimes in

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,510
elections I think we can now call a

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,520
winner in the delivery mechanism for

00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:00,570
entertainment and it is the internet not

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:04,080
cable um a lot of the reason is the

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:08,610
horribleness of cable clients what are

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,850
popularly known as televisions I did not

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,120
wait for Apple TV the last TV we had was

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,000
such a piece of um that I just like

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,250
got an iMac and bolted it to the wall um

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,080
like I don't know what how much better

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,640
Apple TV is going to be like all I need

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,140
is like some way to see the screen while

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm driving it whether a wireless mouse

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,490
um it's a little inconvenient but my god

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,530
it's so much better than that like it

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,120
was from Samsung you know they should

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,760
really not have put their brand on it

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,680
because like every time I was using it I

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,740
was seeing that Samsung on the bottom of

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,910
the screen thinking I hate this company

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,920
it was like it was designed by the same

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,329
people who designed my thermostat but

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:53,829
they had a lot more screen real estate

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:55,930
to up all right some of the

00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,850
attention that people currently devote

00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,920
to watching TV can be stolen by

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,290
completely different things like social

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,660
networks some can be stolen by similar

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,180
things like games but there's always

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,100
going to be this residual demand of

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,410
people who want to sit and watch some

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,810
story unfold that part's not going away

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,550
so how what it comes down to like kill

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,019
Hollywood comes down to how do you

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:23,319
deliver drama via the internet um I'm

00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,089
not sure whatever you make whatever you

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,529
make will have to be on a larger scale

00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,180
than YouTube clips though because when

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,370
you think about it when you sit down to

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,790
watch TV and movies as we probably all

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,339
still do you you either want to watch a

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,720
TV show where you have like some

00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:39,009
characters you already know you can't

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,329
want to know what you're going to get it

00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:41,560
has to be a certain predictable length

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,970
you know what you're going to get you

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,649
know what the characters are either that

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,060
or or it's some big movie and you know

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:49,779
something about the movie in advance

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:52,420
right um there are two ways delivery and

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,699
payment could play out either some big

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,920
company like Netflix or Apple will be

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:59,110
the app store for entertainment I guess

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,269
that would be the entertainment store um

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,550
and you'll reach audiences by just

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,829
getting your stuff into them or they'll

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,929
be too overreaching and inflexible and

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,030
companies will spring up to supply this

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:13,089
kind of stuff ala carte to the producers

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,169
of this this drama if that happens there

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,530
will be a need for infrastructure

00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:23,589
companies too so we'll see um alright

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:27,970
speaking of Apple um number five a new

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:31,390
Apple um now I was talking I was talking

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:35,409
recently to someone who knew Apple well

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:37,090
um I won't give any more details um and

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,620
I asked him if the people now running

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,970
the company would keep being able to

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,559
like come up with new things the way

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:47,169
they used to when Steve Jobs is running

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:49,270
it and he said no um now I sort of

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,799
worried already that that was going to

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,299
be the answer and I asked him more to

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,279
see how

00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,019
he would qualify it than what the actual

00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,450
answer was but you will notice there

00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:00,360
were no qualifications um he just said

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,419
no there will be no new stuff at least

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,559
not that's good

00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,809
beyond whatever is currently in the

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,090
pipeline and even that they'll argue

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:14,279
about what to call it um no actually he

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:18,059
didn't predict that um so um so how do

00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:23,239
we do this right um if Apple is not

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:25,859
going to make the next iPad who is well

00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:27,480
empirically the part none of the

00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,609
existing players are going to make it

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,649
right because none of the existing

00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,289
players are run by product visionaries

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:36,749
and empirically the only way to get a

00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:39,359
product visionary as the CEO of a

00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:44,609
company is for him to start it and not

00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:46,350
get fired mmm so what that means like

00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:47,609
unbelievable as it sounds this is like

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,169
one of these results where you follow

00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:51,720
some logical chain of reasoning and end

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,639
up with this bizarre bizarre consequence

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,739
what that means is the next Apple is

00:18:53,639 --> 00:19:00,690
going to have to be a start-up and that

00:18:55,739 --> 00:19:02,249
sounds preposterous ly ambitious but no

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,619
more ambitious than it was for Apple

00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:07,590
they became as big as Apple right um

00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,600
and someone taking on the problem now

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:13,109
has an advantage that Apple didn't have

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,649
they have the example of Apple um which

00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:20,789
is valuable in two ways one um Steve

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:23,309
Jobs showed us like Roger Bannister did

00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:25,289
what one person can do if you really try

00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:27,419
you can do a lot better than some soot

00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,879
running some electronics company and

00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,470
like you have like the product manager

00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,480
to decide what the features are and then

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,159
you give it to a designer no no no you

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,249
can make things much better than that

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,470
right um the other way he showed us

00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:43,909
what's possible is like the way august's

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:50,789
did it um if you know what I mean um

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:53,100
okay Steve Jobs like there's there's

00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:55,739
definitely like a gap around here in

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,159
Silicon Valley Steve Jobs like unrolled

00:19:55,739 --> 00:20:00,749
the future like a carpet um I don't know

00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,720
about you guys but I had sort of

00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:04,630
unconsciously signed up for just like

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,920
whatever they

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,080
we're gonna make was whatever I would be

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,840
using in the future which is why it was

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,210
so shocking when he died because now

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,870
like who's gonna make the future right

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:23,620
um well whoever it is I don't know mmm

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:25,960
but please apply to Y Combinator um now

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,780
that Steve is gone there is a vacuum we

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,240
can all feel um which means if a new

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,260
company led the way just like said okay

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,000
we're going to lead the way into the

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,280
future of hardware people would follow

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,750
um because they're used to following now

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:43,360
um the CEO of that company the so called

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,400
next Steve Jobs might not you know he

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,910
might just not quite live up to Steve

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,920
Jobs but um he wouldn't have to he would

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:54,370
just have to be better than Samsung and

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:59,370
HP and Motorola right that doesn't sound

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,370
quite so hard does it okay

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,179
number six all right you guys are gonna

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:09,190
hate this one um except for the like 30

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,190
or so of you who are like oh my god I've

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,269
been working on um alright number six

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,940
bring back the old Moore's law mmm the

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:21,639
last 10 years have reminded us what

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,259
Moore's law actually said it didn't say

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,419
computers we're gonna get twice as fast

00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:27,279
every 18 months it said circuits we're

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:29,619
going to get twice as dense I can

00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,649
remember when it used to seem pedantic

00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:36,429
to point that out right um but not

00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:38,889
anymore mmm well this Moore's law is not

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,690
as good as the old one the old Moore's

00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:43,239
law used to mean that if your software

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,190
was slow all you had to do was wait and

00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,960
the inexorable I remember this it was

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,339
the great as we'd say should we work on

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,509
optimizing and it like whatever we'll

00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:54,339
just wait for the next generation of

00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:56,619
processors um you know hardware would

00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,869
just like solve software's problems well

00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:00,909
now now we have to work right now if

00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:03,219
your software is slow instead of just

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,899
waiting you have to rewrite it to do

00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:07,479
more things in parallel and that is a

00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:07,690
lot more work no one knows better than I

00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:11,080
do

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:13,239
mmm it would be great if a startup could

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,909
give I mean really great um if a

00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:18,219
start-up could give back something of

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:21,009
the old Moore's law by making a lot of

00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:23,559
CPUs look to the developer like one real

00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:26,799
big fast CPU there are several ways to

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,299
do it the most ambitious and I'm not

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,559
even sure this is possible we'll see

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,019
it's all going to be a matter of degree

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,879
but the most ambitious way is to do it

00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,039
automatically by writing a compiler that

00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:37,839
like takes programs written for written

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,580
the old way and turns them into programs

00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,169
for the new hardware I mean that is what

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,169
compilers are supposed to do right so

00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,339
problem is there's a name for this

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,820
compiler this fishing least smart

00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:55,059
compiler and it is a byword for

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:58,330
impossibility so is it really impossible

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:01,059
though is it really the case that no

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,919
configuration of the memory of the bits

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,629
in memory of an existing of a

00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,399
present-day computer is this compiler

00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:09,339
because if you really think that you

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:10,509
should by formalizing certain aspects of

00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,070
it you should try to prove it because

00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:14,360
that would be an interesting result and

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,150
if it's not impossible but simply very

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,180
be very hard the expected value of

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,460
working on it might be pretty high

00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,010
the reason the expected value is so high

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,290
is Web Services if you could write

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,700
software that gave programmers the

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,560
convenience of the way things were in

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,120
the old days you would get all the users

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,480
because programmers like convenience

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,930
just suppose there was a processor

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,970
manufacturer that had continued to be

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,710
able to translate increasing circuit

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,670
densities into increasing clock

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:49,580
speeds right now like Intel would be

00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:52,730
worried they would take all of Intel's

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,950
business well now in the world of web

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,690
services you don't see your processors

00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,820
anymore which means if you had this

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,370
software it would be indistinguishable

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,800
from the users point of view from you

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:08,000
being that manufacturer right that's

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,710
what's at stake um ok the less ambitious

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,930
way of approaching this problem is to

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,430
start from the bottom and instead of

00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,550
like having the compiler do everything

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:19,220
for you you build programs out of more

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:22,580
parallelizable Lego blocks like Hadoop

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,890
and MapReduce um that's obviously doable

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,390
it's happening um then the programmer

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,890
still does most of the work and there's

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,890
probably lots of startup ideas even

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,930
there um there is an intriguing middle

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,320
ground where you build a semi-automatic

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,570
weapon um where there's a human in the

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,250
loop you looked you build something that

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,140
looks to the user like this efficiently

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,220
smart compiler but actually there's

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,500
humans in there optimizing um these

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,910
people might be your employees but it

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,980
might be even more exciting if you

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,780
created a marketplace for optimization

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,820
now of course suppose there was a

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,230
marketplace for optimization you guys

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,760
are probably are some of you guys are

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,800
probably already thinking about what I'm

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,230
going to suggest suggest next people

00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,450
would start to write BOTS right to do

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,890
the optimization and if you ever got to

00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,230
the point where it could all be done by

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,930
BOTS you would be in the very curious

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,360
situation of actually having created the

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,280
sufficiently smart compiler but no one

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,670
would have a copy of

00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,840
um that would be pretty interesting I

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,490
mean that would be worth doing just

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,030
because it would be so interesting um

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:29,690
all right so I realize believe me I

00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,190
realize how crazy all this sounds there

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,750
was division among the Y Combinator

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,220
partners whether I should even mention

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,570
this one Robert Morris thought I would

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,940
sound like an idiot if I even brought it

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,440
up Paul Buchheit and Aaron Ibis said hey

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,250
what the hell you know maybe it'll work

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,110
um but what I like about this idea is

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,660
all the different ways in which it's

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,610
wrong the whole idea of focusing on

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,380
optimization is counter to the general

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,840
trend in software development for

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,490
decades right trying to write this

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,640
efficiently smart compiler is by

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,410
definition a mistake and even if it

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,790
weren't compilers are supposed to be

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,770
this sort of software that's written by

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,910
open source projects not startups right

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:11,960
so the the forum troll which I have by

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,700
now internalized mmm doesn't even know

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,550
where to begin in raising objections to

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:20,570
this idea um but I'm sure I'll find out

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:23,900
this afternoon on Hacker News yeah that

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,120
is what I call a startup idea um but

00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,130
wait there's one that will face even

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,320
greater resistance this is my last one

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,950
on the list number seven ongoing

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,930
diagnosis um one of my many tricks for

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,610
generating startup ideas is to imagine

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,910
the ways we will seem backwards to

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:43,010
people in the future um and I am pretty

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,740
sure that 50 or 100 years from now it

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,950
will seem barbaric to people that we had

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,900
to wait until we had symptoms to be

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,470
diagnosed with things like heart disease

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,930
and cancer for example in 2004 Bill

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,300
Clinton found he was feeling short of

00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,340
breath and went to his doctors and they

00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,790
said your arteries are over 90% blocked

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,280
in three days later he had a quadruple

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,710
bypass now it seems reasonable to assume

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,990
that Bill Clinton has access to the best

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,970
medical care available and even he had

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,170
to wait until his arteries were 90%

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:20,750
blocked to learn that the number was 90%

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,190
right um that can't be that hard to

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,200
figure out with some kind of

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,490
non-destructive testing I mean maybe

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,180
version one could you destructive

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,180
testing I don't know

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,360
you have a version one maybe I shouldn't

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,900
be funding software startups doing

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:42,720
medical devices um just get something

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:44,660
out quickly launch fast and iterate you

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,130
could do heart disease for pigs first

00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,820
and you could like run a sausage company

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:56,730
on the side to monetize it this is this

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:58,230
is not in the talk but like surely at

00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,940
some point in the future we're gonna

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,000
know this number the way we know our

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,380
weight right um so why don't you start a

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,200
startup to do that um

00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,790
cancer - it seems crazy that you have to

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,410
wait until you have some lump and you go

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,240
to the doctor and you have the lump and

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,870
they say oh it's cancer right I think

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,340
what will happen is pretty soon we'll

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,660
have some sort of radar screen that

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,210
cancers will show up on much more

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,950
quickly um it might not be cancer as we

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,890
now think that I wouldn't be surprised

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,750
if at any given time we all have tens or

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,370
even hundreds of micro cancers going on

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,040
at any given time and we just don't know

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:35,630
about it but like we'll know right but

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,910
it won't be the end of the world um so

00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,140
one of the obstacles the big obstacles

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,700
to come from this well if there's so

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,820
many obstacles some of the big obstacles

00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,800
to come to this idea what will come from

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,970
the medical profession this is not the

00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,980
way the medical profession has

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,560
traditionally worked right traditionally

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,030
you feel symptoms and you go to a doctor

00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,920
and the doctor figures out what's wrong

00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:00,840
um a lot of doctors were rather alarmed

00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,880
at the idea of doing what lawyers call a

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,230
fishing expedition and going to look for

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,900
problems that you don't even know were

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,800
there um problems you don't even you

00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,780
don't even know what kind of problem

00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,520
you're looking for um they have a name

00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,550
for the things that you discover when

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,650
you do this incidentalomas mmm and

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,900
doctors regard them as kind of a pain in

00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,670
the ass

00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,680
for example a friend of mine once had

00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,200
her brain scanned as part of a study and

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:28,550
was horrified to discover what appeared

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,780
to be a large tumor in her brain and

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:33,000
after further testing it turned out to

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,640
be a harmless cyst but she had a couple

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,640
weeks of Terror there

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,250
um a lot of doctors worry that if you

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,810
start testing people all the time this

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:46,550
is what you'll get a lot of terrifying a

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:49,790
lot of terrifying false alarms that make

00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:51,920
patients panic and require expensive and

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:54,200
possibly dangerous tests to resolve but

00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,090
I think that that is just an artifact of

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,690
current limitations I think the way it's

00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,910
going to play out

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:00,260
is if people are scanned all the time

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,610
and they will know about these things

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,170
early and they will realize oh that

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,170
thing in my brain is just like a

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:08,450
birthmark it's always been there there's

00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,790
room for a lot of startups here the

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,650
obstacles they face will be horrific in

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,690
addition to the technical obstacles all

00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,870
startups face and the bureaucratic

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,550
obstacles all medical startups face

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,740
you'll be going against thousands of

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,930
years is medical tradition but it will

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,360
happen and it will be a great thing um

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,850
and people in the future will feel as

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,710
sorry for us as we do for generations

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,920
before you didn't have anesthetic or

00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,540
antibiotics all right so now well I'll

00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,110
give you a little tactical advice how

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:45,830
much time do I have left anybody know oh

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:47,570
hey um how much enough huh all right um

00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,150
I'm going to conclude with a little

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,890
tactical advice if you want to take on a

00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,380
problem as big as the ones I have been

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,720
talking about do not make a direct

00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,060
frontal attack on the problem don't say

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,600
for example you're going to replace

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:04,340
email um where your employees and

00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,910
investors will constantly be saying are

00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,240
we there yet

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,320
um and haters will be lined up waiting

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,560
to watch you fail

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,140
um just say you're building to-do lists

00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,910
software what could be more harmless um

00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,090
they can notice that you've replaced

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,190
email when it's a fait accompli um just

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,910
as people will notice about iPads

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:27,470
replacing windows um

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,940
empirically the way to do really big

00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,390
things seem to be to start with small

00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,310
things and row them bigger want to

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,860
dominate micro computer software for

00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,690
decades start by writing a basic

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,760
interpreter for a machine with a couple

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,720
of thousand users want to make the

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,820
universal website a giant vacuum for

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,590
people's time from

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,420
start by building a website where

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:56,210
Harvard undergrads can stock one another

00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:57,650
hmm empirically it's not just for other

00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,780
people's sake that you need to start

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,900
small you seem to for your own sake -

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,940
neither Bill Gates nor Mark Zuckerberg

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,890
knew how big their companies were going

00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:11,270
to get all he knew was that they were on

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,980
to something maybe it's a bad idea maybe

00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,630
it's a bad idea to have really big

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,000
ambitions initially because the bigger

00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,740
your ambitions the longer they're going

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,540
to take to realize and the longer you're

00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,420
projecting into the future the more

00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,070
likely you're going to be wrong there

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,710
are plenty of examples of that too

00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,200
so I think the best way to do these big

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,900
ideas is not to try and identify a

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,640
precise point in the future and say how

00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,700
do I get from here to there like the

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,800
popular image of a visionary I think a

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,690
better model is Columbus who thought

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:46,430
there's something to the West

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:48,740
hey I'll sail westward start with

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:51,500
something that works that you know works

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,440
that's small and then when the

00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,800
opportunity comes to move move westward

00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:01,190
right um the popular image of the

00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,830
visionary is someone with a very very

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,050
precise view of the future but

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:11,030
empirically it's probably better to have

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:12,740
a blurry one so that's my whole talk am

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,570
I done do I am I out of time or should I

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,150
take questions or what how much time do

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,470
I have left no I don't want to do

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,420
whatever I want I want to do what you

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:24,620
want what do you want all right um

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:28,090
California yeah whatever you want

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:30,710
whatever is true for you um all right

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:33,440
nine minutes they say that's what I

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:37,450
wanted a number okay um if anybody has

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:41,180
any questions I will now answer them

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,530
anybody have any yes yell I'll repeat

00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,600
the question as long as I can hear you

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,300
it's cool all right and one of your

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,640
recent things online you said the answer

00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,830
for the music industry for example is

00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,110
probably to give up insisting on payment

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,820
for recorded music and focus on

00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,470
licensing licensing and live shows yeah

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,910
all right I would like I've been talking

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,150
to Vinton Cerf and some people about

00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:06,700
this Licensing's exactly what when

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,110
copyrights mean nothing you know the

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,760
internet and software and a viable

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,790
business train only because software

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,740
enjoys these copyrights so how can you

00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:17,290
just sort of throw away the music

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,120
industry's product and copyright and yet

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,880
tell all these people to work on things

00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,470
that must be protected by copyright

00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,510
trademark a form of copyright and

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:30,700
process patents well I don't think you

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,350
necessarily have to protect your stuff I

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,240
don't think if you build technology you

00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,250
have to protect it with copyright I mean

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,030
Amazon Web Services isn't protected with

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,960
a copyright

00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,430
um I think selling copies of stuff like

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,020
if you simply do that like you make a

00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,060
copy of stuff and you sell lots of it

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,620
it's just not practically going to work

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:51,730
um you know that the funny thing is I

00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,170
was going to write an essay about this

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,400
but maybe I'll just like make it up on

00:34:53,170 --> 00:35:00,090
the fly um the funny thing is like what

00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,290
what is property is actually

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,270
historically has been somewhat defined

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,250
by what it's convenient to be property

00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,900
right so like in the days of

00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,180
hunter-gatherers it was not convenient

00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,770
for land to be property right but now it

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,480
is and Sonia now land his property um if

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,240
you imagine that we lived like on the

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,010
moon and everything and you know we had

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,920
to get like air and pipes and paid for

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,870
the air right um it was people could

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,260
charge for smells people could charge

00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,820
for good smells right um and so it

00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,980
seemed reasonable for like smells to be

00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,840
property but now like you walk by you

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,370
walk by a restaurant and you smell this

00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,680
like delicious smell you get like this

00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,540
free boost for nothing and like someone

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,100
coming I'd be I think the record labels

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,320
are like these people who are from the

00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,150
moon right and they used to be able to

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,620
sell these things because it was so

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,850
because that was the only way you could

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,610
the only way you could get them was

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,770
through their channel but now like files

00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,330
move around like smells and it's just

00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,000
not convenient to charge for them

00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,350
ultimately this stuff is pragmatic um I

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,870
realized that doesn't sound very

00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,950
principled but historically it seems to

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,600
be the way things work

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,150
you just can't charge for copies of

00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,050
stuff anymore you know it just it just

00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,510
it just doesn't practically work

00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:15,470
anymore and I charge for copies of

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:17,420
software um it's the same copyright

00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,680
protection yeah I know I don't think I

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,120
don't think you same copyright

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,890
protection so you can't just say that's

00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,090
too inconvenient I don't think it works

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,790
as well as you used to

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:28,940
I mean there are some people who pay for

00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,080
copies of music right and then a lot of

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,090
people don't and there are some people

00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,060
who pay for copies of software and a lot

00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,350
of people don't right so maybe you you

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,150
will be able to make some money by

00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,860
making copies of stuff you won't be able

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,090
to print money the way the label is used

00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:47,930
to back in the 80s also taking over

00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:50,540
books and movies well you know as a

00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,670
public as a writer of books I feel like

00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,560
writing books I mean it never made that

00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,990
much money people did it mostly out of

00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,170
vanity Hey

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:06,770
and so now the ratio of vanity to money

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:10,010
is even higher all right do we have

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,470
another question yes okay um my question

00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,570
was in regards to your third or fourth

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:19,190
idea about killing universities yeah

00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:20,090
replacing universities not killing we're

00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:25,670
just gonna go to sleep

00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:28,990
I feel like um your objections to the

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,610
university as it stands are missing some

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,380
actual value they provide to society

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,630
instead of just being linked certificate

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,330
you know Mills that you were paying for

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,650
I feel like it's gonna be very hard to

00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,690
like make you know a group of

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,700
hackerspaces sit down and parse like all

00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,610
the data from the LHC for years and

00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,560
years or work on theories of post Mars

00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,060
on both of which are you know equally

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,700
valid

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:57,200
whereas in research uh uh and also I

00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,750
feel like a lot of universities their

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,000
values in the social networks that you

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:04,190
create in real life and know just the

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,340
you know the Facebook ones you have were

00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:09,200
on I was wondering you know what in a

00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,690
world without physical university it's

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,760
kind of contributes to a culture of

00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:16,040
alienation by means of technological

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,110
abstraction wouldn't a future without

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,410
physical universities contribute to a

00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,410
what

00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:28,320
my light friends are complaining about

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,640
how you know err no way tops anybody

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,730
else anymore because you're always on

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,440
Twitter and you know e texting or

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,200
whatever so the problem is would it be

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,280
bad if people don't physically meet is

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,780
that's what you're talking about right

00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,980
that's the physicalness of universities

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,600
that people all get together at the

00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,970
universities and twitter is not a

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,650
substitute for that well let me tell you

00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,720
I'm all in favor of people physically

00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,000
meeting every six months I make 150

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,150
people move to California and they can't

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,500
get out of it um so I definitely agree

00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,960
with you things have got to happen in

00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,910
person right um we like to fund startups

00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,440
here and like all you guys have moved

00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,700
here in person right you're not just

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,470
talking to one another on Twitter you

00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,830
can like shake hands with the person

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:10,260
next to you um so definitely I agree

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,140
with you people have to meet in person

00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:19,500
um but you can make things that involve

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:22,610
people meeting in person alright do you

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:27,450
have any more questions you want to yell

00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:30,000
just yell okay yes it works

00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:33,510
so um there is a very interesting

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,870
phenomenon on the universities at the

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,260
PhD level where a doctoral education is

00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:42,390
essentially a distributed phenomenon

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,480
it's not which not so much which

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,980
University you were you receive your PhD

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,020
from it's who signed your dissertation

00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,320
the three or four people that were on

00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:55,200
your PhD committee yeah so a very

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,060
disruptive idea may in fact be and I

00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,750
guess I'm also given the free idea to

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:04,640
everybody in this room is it possible to

00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:07,350
make a baccalaureate so lower level of

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,880
lower levels of for university education

00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,560
it is possible to make that a

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,930
distributed phenomenon as well where

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,490
your credentials are from your adviser

00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,970
from your lab from your research

00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:19,380
projects yeah that's an interesting idea

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,600
that's an interesting idea the idea is

00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,950
instead of getting a degree from a an

00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,770
institution you would get it from a

00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,270
person which is actually if you know

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,220
about the history of universities that's

00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,440
how it originally used to work I mean

00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,050
universities had a guild system and you

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,580
would be certified as a teacher by an

00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,380
existing teacher just like you could be

00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,230
certified as a woodworker by an existing

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,420
woodworker so since it was the way they

00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,300
used to work maybe universities were

00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,400
their replacements will be returning to

00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,320
their roots I'm not saying like get rid

00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,470
of universities just like eat away at

00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:57,710
that big lump of cheese any more

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,710
questions yes shout and I'll repeat it

00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,780
yeah

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:35,040
I mean the technology my concern

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,880
what are your principles

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,130
that very mountain very well may

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,540
significantly affect like our genetic

00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:46,350
code

00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:48,330
Wow um okay so the question was what are

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,510
my principles on funding something that

00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:54,860
could affect our genetic code so that's

00:41:51,510 --> 00:42:00,420
definitely a fundamental question um

00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:02,790
honestly I hadn't thought about it I try

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,830
like trying fund founders who seem like

00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:07,670
they're going to succeed and if the idea

00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:11,340
seems overtly evil then we don't do it

00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:13,620
but like affecting our genetic code I

00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,940
mean probably already affecting our

00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,560
genetic code because we make all these

00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,250
people move here and they end up like

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:28,170
getting girlfriends and procreating um

00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:31,110
so a very small number of them I don't

00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,360
know I don't know I surprised where we

00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,190
don't have like I never really thought

00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,900
about that before I mean we haven't

00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,600
funded a lot of people doing medical

00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,980
type stuff um we would just we don't get

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,450
many applications to do that kind of

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,410
thing so I don't know we're just trying

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:48,840
to play it play it by ear um but ah we

00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:51,390
have Paul Buchheit Paul Buchheit like

00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,730
invented don't be evil right um so Paul

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:57,540
Buchheit is our official morality

00:42:53,730 --> 00:43:02,100
consultant in the minimally and he he

00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:05,280
tells us when things are evil um boy you

00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,520
would be surprised um you'd be very

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:14,820
surprised um sorry if that's a bad

00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:16,980
answer yes question does it make it

00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,570
easier to outsource my evil detection

00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,340
well when I said Paul Buchheit was our

00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:24,090
morality consultant I was actually kind

00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:26,160
of joking um so I mean but you know

00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:28,710
although it does turn out it turns out

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,450
somehow with moral questions you have to

00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,250
ask other people's advice more than

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,380
technical questions right I don't know

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,030
maybe I'm morally incompetent and

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,260
technically competent but with technical

00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,090
questions you can just see what you got

00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,670
to do a lot of the time and moral

00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,440
questions you have to ask other people

00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,000
there's probably an essay there too too

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,330
bad I don't write them anymore

00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,430
um yes so just an easier question than

00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,950
that one and an easier question showing

00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,800
a direction of alright technical things

00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:59,190
why does news dot y combinator comm

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,030
return lines delimited by CR instead of

00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,030
CRLs

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,579
because like I wanted to write an HTTP

00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:15,710
server and I didn't read the spec I just

00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:19,220
like did stuff until my browser could

00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:21,049
get pages back right um so it's all some

00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,930
early version of Firefox is Fault

00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:26,210
essentially um when I could see pages on

00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:29,869
my browser I'm like well seems to work

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:31,730
um so see I mean I this may actually get

00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:33,829
fixed we hired somebody to work on

00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,069
making hacker news faster you'll be

00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:38,990
happy to hear um and they'll probably

00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:40,790
fix that in the process there's some

00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,230
line somewhere where I should like add a

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,910
line feed or a carriage return that's

00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,339
not there or something but like it's

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,720
never been on my top 100 things to do to

00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:49,010
go and look in the source and fix that

00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,040
because it like works on my browser

00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:54,250
right sorry

00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,250
ah

00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:05,119
thanks a lot well it won't be the first

00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:07,790
all right yes so you talked about the

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:12,109
next Apple and one of the things we've

00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:16,040
been seeing is Apple have been winning

00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:18,049
in partly in the price war for the

00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,030
delivery of hardware particularly their

00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:22,069
their tablet screens because they have

00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,140
such buying power and they can they can

00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:26,299
buy up the manufacturing capacity yeah

00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,339
and particularly for small startups

00:45:26,299 --> 00:45:29,869
looking to to make hardware to make

00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:31,970
innovative and groundbreaking huh yeah

00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:34,430
manufacturing has to be a really

00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,510
difficult problem to to solve so how are

00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,920
you going to compete Apple when they

00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,270
have such scale is that what you're

00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,490
saying how you gonna write and how do

00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:42,500
you think is that they're an opportunity

00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:44,270
for this sort of manalo cake when I say

00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,130
control versus when I say compete

00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,079
against Apple I mean I'm not saying the

00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,780
startups first product should be like a

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,490
competitor to the iPad um you should

00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,290
probably not even the startup should

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,970
probably not even do consumer stuff

00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:59,030
initially they should do something

00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:00,890
that's like something for hackers you

00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,780
know like the Arduino if those guys had

00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,700
startup ambitions right they make this

00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,400
thing that like wouldn't even seem like

00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,470
a threat to Apple right um and it's just

00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,359
something it's for hackers then they

00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,740
solder this stuff together themselves

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,390
and ship them out and when they get the

00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,549
money back they buy more parts so you

00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,440
don't think a start-up can make consumer

00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:20,020
devices

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,819
it depends on what the device is if it

00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,069
was cheap enough maybe you could maybe

00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:24,819
you could make some kind of like headset

00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:26,829
thingy

00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:29,980
you know jawbone is a start-up I think

00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:31,960
there's an opportunity to to interface

00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,240
to the sort of the monolithic

00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,099
manufacturing processes and make it I

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,599
mean we've seen some of the like 3d

00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:39,040
printers some of the kick starters the

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,020
way they're making there is no choice

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,460
there is a startup in the current YC

00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,319
batch doing this there's a startup in

00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,170
the current YC batch that's like the

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:49,480
print button for your circuit designs um

00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:52,000
like you just hit print and like stuff

00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,599
arrives from China finally this this

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,010
stuff printer so yes there is an

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,180
opportunity there don't think they

00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,740
haven't launched yet so I can't see what

00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,300
they're called no time for further

00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,829
questions on this we're done I just

00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,240
wanted on the point of information to

00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:06,940
let you know that you were the first

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,740
keynote speaker had the very first PyCon

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,480
Oh was I in 2003

00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,160
Wow thank you for doing that thank you

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,700
for coming back this one was way more

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,700
interesting

00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,460
