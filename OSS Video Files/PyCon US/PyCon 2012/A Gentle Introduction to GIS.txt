started here first talk is going to be

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,330
gentle introduction to GIS by Jason

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,069
Shire

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,670
I certainly hope it's gentle I'll just

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,750
adjust my perfect personal experience I

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,880
was actually doing some open data

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,520
mapping this last year and realized that

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,930
I was way out of my league with GIS so

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:27,119
I'm really looking forward to this so

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:30,210
I'm gonna turn it over to Jason hi I'm

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,170
Jason Shire I work at every which does

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,700
all GIS software um I've already got the

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,380
slides online if you'd like to look at

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,840
them now and there's a few links on that

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,640
page as well um first off we're going to

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,379
talk about what this talk is and

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,270
basically I'm not going to talk about

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,390
web mapping any web mapping platforms at

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,980
all I am a Python developer I started as

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,930
a Python developer I sort of fell into

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,600
GIS and so I'm going to talk about the

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,789
things I wish I had known basically the

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,980
terminology not necessarily the tools

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,379
but the theory behind a lot of what's

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,390
going on in GIS that took me a long time

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,799
to figure out a lot longer that should

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,909
have so first off GIS is a lot more than

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,760
just dropping points on a map

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,130
I mean you've got lines you've got

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,420
polygons but then you pan out you look

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,259
at the horizon and you've got some

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,170
terrain dedi you've got

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,490
three-dimensional data you can drape

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,590
some imagery on top of that from a

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,780
satellite and now you've got raster data

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,460
and you know you zoom into a building

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,119
and you can store all kinds of

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,130
three-dimensional information as well

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,680
this is also useful 3d information is

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,189
used a lot underground too for things

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,380
like gas and oil exploration so I'm

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,850
going to cut it up into three prongs I'm

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,990
going to talk about storage and file

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,880
formats I'm going to talk about

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,530
visualization and I'm going to talk

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,110
about analysis and I'm mostly going to

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,100
emphasize the visualization because

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,450
that's the part that's easy to get wrong

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,360
as a Python developer that's the part

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,990
that's kind of the mystery so first off

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,070
storage you're going to have two major

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,869
forms of data you're going to have

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,219
vector data lines polygons that sort of

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,110
thing and you're going to have raster

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,200
data which are basically imagery that's

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,940
plastered on surface of the earth for

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,580
vector data the unfortunate thing is

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,680
that the shape file is still the major

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,220
interchange format the shape file is a

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,170
misnomer

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,860
and that it is actually three files and

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:25,440
one of them is a DBF file it will not

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,980
die other formats are kml which is xml

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,840
but it's easy to distribute goj sounds

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,930
another nice one that's human readable

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,880
spatial light is a very specific build

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,830
of sequel light that includes spatial

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,000
types um it's a little hard to get up

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,370
and running but it's nice when you do

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,920
the exact opposite is our proprietary

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,080
ESRI file jaded geo database format

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,940
which is a closed format but very easy

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,320
to get up and running linked into a

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,030
c-sharp or a C++ code base for databases

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,090
they're all relational the ones with

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,400
spatial types every big one has it Bar

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,530
None post GIS is the best option to get

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,230
started it's got amazing spatial types

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,070
it's got great spatial operators I

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,630
recommend you download it read the

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,120
documentation and get started with that

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,770
as soon as you leave this talk for

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,020
raster data you've got another set of

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,600
formats there are a lot more of them

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,790
some of them are more proprietary than

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,590
others my favorite is geo TIFF because

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,570
it's just got some extra exif tags on

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,090
the image other formats that are

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,010
becoming popular netcdf and hdf5 are

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,530
good for scientific data and raster

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,090
datasets a lot of whether there's an HD

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,530
f5 talk that overlaps this that you

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,820
might want to catch the end of it you

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,170
can other other versions of raster data

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,170
for imagery some have different types of

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,420
compression levels some are basically

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,440
lossy or lossless depending on the type

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,110
of data that they deal with they're

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,070
usually very large-scale global imagery

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,000
so there's quite a bit more um

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,239
proprietary scary stuff that I don't

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,500
understand it involved in that stuff

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,590
jeaious data is all completely

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,739
conventional and I mean this in a very

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,900
it's very boring GIS data for the most

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,350
part is stored in a relational or

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,239
relational like store with columns with

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,370
types and the only real special thing

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,030
about it is it's got a column with some

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,519
geometry on it there are I haven't seen

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,979
anything in the no sequel world that

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,049
does much beyond point lookup so I'm not

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,210
going to include them most of the data

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,890
you see is going to be in some sort of

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,750
relational form even even in a shape

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,030
file

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,710
the constraints aren't though in a

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,000
normal database you've got some fairly

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,770
simple constraints you've got foreign

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,940
key constraints you've got you know

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,050
you've got an integer that you've got to

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,600
keep in a certain range something like

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,300
that when you're talking about spatial

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,400
data you have more constraints with

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,500
relationships between the data between

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,910
the shapes themselves so say you've got

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,040
instead of a foreign key relationship

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,840
every point in your point data must be

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,420
within a polygon in some other table or

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,000
you've got some land use data you cannot

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,900
have slivers of unused land in between

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,120
each parcel that is bad that can cause a

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,910
lot of legal problems and so the idea of

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,060
keeping something spatially integral is

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,170
called a topology a topological rule you

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,780
want to keep your entire data set clean

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,630
and there there you usually put these

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,630
rules on your data base level and the

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,140
tools use for doing data management with

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,390
file formats in in open-source are

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,070
mostly the GDL project Deedle is kind of

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,380
the gold standard for doing rosters and

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,260
it's got a sub project called ogre for

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,160
doing vector data for the most part

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,060
you're going to be using the

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,400
command-line tools for doing

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,980
transformations and conversions and

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,780
stuff in in the open source world on the

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,110
arcgis stack they're all geoprocessing

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,200
tools which are accessible from the from

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,669
from python they're fairly simple you

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,440
would probably be calling out to the

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,850
command line and open source in the

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,680
arcgis stack you would be calling out

00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:01,500
from a python script so i was talking

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,220
about one of those columns is translate

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,610
and reproject

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,400
what are those parts and this is what

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,540
the hardest part for me to learn was

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,350
first off let's think of the earth as a

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,870
perfect sphere which it's not it's kind

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:19,020
of weird and oblong and treating it like

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,550
a sphere mostly works but not always so

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,710
we're going instead of just having a

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,870
single a simple circle we're going to

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,729
turn it into a 3d 3-dimensional ellipse

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,110
and we're going to tweak the parameters

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,090
so that it's a little bit fatter in the

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,020
middle and a little bit tweaked so that

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,870
it more

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,740
it fits the shape of the earth a little

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,510
bit better and this is called a data say

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,009
we're looking at these two points on

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,379
earth they it's

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,939
this datum is good enough it covers the

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,520
earth more or less in the correct shape

00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,740
but on that upper arrow you'll notice

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,319
it's a little bit off if we're only

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,300
talking about data that is in that upper

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,649
area where it is a little bit off then

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,449
we don't need that precision across the

00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,789
world we only need it in that one place

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,800
so we tweak it to become a local datum

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,599
we just change a couple more parameters

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,949
and it's more accurate there but if you

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,399
look on the other side of the world

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:12,059
it's way further off so a local datum is

00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,279
only for local data and you'll see when

00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,689
you zoom in you know a datum regardless

00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,659
of how good it is regardless of how

00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:19,680
accurate it is it does not contain

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:21,539
topological information it does not

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,490
contain your elevation data when you get

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,809
WGS fixed and you giggle because you're

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,029
at the beach and it tells you you're 40

00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:31,529
feet underwater that is the closest you

00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:33,779
can get with that mathematical model the

00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,849
science of measuring the earth has been

00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,830
around a lot longer than satellites

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:41,339
about as long as trig on

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,649
trigonometry it's called geodesy there

00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,669
are a lot of people who like surveyors

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,289
and that sort of thing who have been

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:49,259
around doing this for a very long time

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,870
that have very specific scientific

00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,099
methods for doing this stuff that

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,800
they're good to talk to but they're a

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,539
little confusing so the one datum that

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,069
you're going to care about the most the

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,289
one you're using implicitly with all

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:05,309
your spatial data right now whenever you

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:07,229
get a GPS fix is the wgs84 datum this

00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:08,459
one this is something you should take

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,169
away from this talk when you need to

00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:14,370
know what spatial reference you're using

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,569
you are probably using wgs84 if you're

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,309
looking at some government data

00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,809
something specific to the United States

00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,399
you're probably using the North American

00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:22,439
datum that's one of those tweaked ones

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,419
that I showed where you push it around a

00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,430
little bit this one is better for North

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,499
American data I mean the variances are

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,689
within you know centimeters usually for

00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,789
various datums but it's kind of

00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,990
important again for like land use or if

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,169
you're building a skyscraper or

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,760
something so again let's now that we

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,769
know how to model mathematically what

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,079
the world looks like and kind of get an

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:45,660
idea of its shape in a very abstract way

00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:48,360
how do we talk about the points on that

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,089
map so we're going to imagine this

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,189
perfect sphere and we're just going to

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,160
draw a line across a nice little equator

00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:56,709
that gives us a point

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,379
pretty intuitive to know where we are

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,779
north or south of this the center of

00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,329
place but then we need a prime meridian

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:07,209
and this is abstract this is completely

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,649
arbitrary because there is no place on

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,949
earth where it makes sense to divide it

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:14,199
in half you can tweak your Prime

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,779
Meridian in various map projections in

00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:19,810
fact to recenter the earth on your area

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:21,910
of interest and now that we've got two

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,160
axes to talk to it talked about a point

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,839
we can actually look at we can actually

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,129
refer to a point and you're usually

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,589
going to use degrees you're going to use

00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:32,589
some sort of Radian or degree based

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,910
system for referring to it in caught in

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,730
the context of these two circles that

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,399
you've drawn around the earth and you

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,560
know you'll see in a lot of older GIS

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,540
data you'll see degree minute second

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,800
usually when you have a GPS fix you're

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,540
getting it back in decimal degrees

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,610
that's probably what we all think of

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,649
world coordinates in and then this next

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,240
one is a UTM zone this is something

00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,279
special because it's not referring to

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,439
things in the context of the entire

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,250
world we're talking about a grid of

00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:02,769
meters that we've cut the world up into

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,389
so UTM zone we slightly first we're

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,000
going to slice up the world into six

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,269
degree wide sections we're going to stop

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,980
at 84 north and 84 south because those

00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:14,410
wouldn't make any sense we have

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,689
different projections for those now that

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,009
we've got it chopped up into areas you

00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,480
basically take it and you turn it

00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:23,230
sideways and you've got a projection you

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,579
can use to minimize distortion you then

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,860
from there you can cut it up into grids

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,870
and these grids have numbers and letters

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,189
and are kind of weird but this is your

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,199
point of reference once once you've got

00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:35,019
some data that's local enough to fit in

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:36,579
one or two of these squares um you go

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,069
ahead and use a UTM grid because you get

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,740
meters and when you have meters you

00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:43,809
don't have to worry about being seven or

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,670
eight decimal points deep before you get

00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:49,990
to the relevant part of your coordinate

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,050
and as we know floating-point numbers on

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,579
computers are really bad at remembering

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,160
anything beyond the first or second

00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:58,809
digit and a float anyway so that point

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,259
we were just looking at again it's in

00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:06,440
p30 p33 it's a certain number of meters

00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:09,590
east and north another way of referring

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,540
two places on earth or if referential to

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,820
a specific point and again we can use a

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,560
Cartesian plane here to make math easier

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,440
rather than the degrees that we used in

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,870
the WGS datum and this is the u.s. state

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,360
plane the United States is cut up into a

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,370
bunch of little pieces and everything in

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,950
each of those pieces is referred to in

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,500
reference to an origin point so it's all

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,290
all Cartesian you can do 2d math on it

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,960
and it works great most government data

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,720
isn't in some sort of state plane so

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,090
again we've got a system on a beautiful

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,290
perfect sphere with the with reference

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:47,660
to using degrees or not so much on the

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,050
grid systems and we fit it to a lumpy

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,370
bumpy earth so again we're going to

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,800
we're going to have different coordinate

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,210
systems to refer to places on earth

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,420
based on how much of the earth we care

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,300
about better more or less accurate

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,000
locally but work better in the area of

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,320
interest you're talking about your data

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,090
so you've got a geographic coordinate

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,580
system here and so now we're going to go

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,440
into the visualization this is the hard

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,680
part this is this is where we're getting

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,900
into maps so here's a map this is

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,550
actually using the ESRI tiles but it's

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
the same thing you can overlay it

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,730
straight on a Google map and it's the

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,470
same tiles it's this it's the same

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,950
tiling scheme it's the same everything

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,960
which these are just prettier like using

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,970
every map projection is taking you from

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,000
a coordinate on the surface or at some

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,280
point near the earth in reference to 3d

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,710
space and you were flattening it onto a

00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,450
piece of paper or a screen so you are

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,450
losing a dimension of resolution so

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,720
we're going to build up getting a map

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,730
first we're going to start out with some

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,440
datum or some grid some way of modeling

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,660
our area of interest of the earth though

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,440
you just say for for GPS coordinates a

00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,380
local UTM zone for meters again or a

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,850
state plane which then we use to refer

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,310
to places on earth with our geographic

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,190
coordinate system from there we have our

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,750
mapping that map's the geographic

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,089
coordinates to a projected coordinate

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,920
system which is what we then use to put

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,260
things on screen to look at them as a

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,020
map there's a big trade off between

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,550
every map since you are going down to a

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,959
two dimensional surface

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,320
you can either preserve shape or you can

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,330
preserve area ones that preserve shape

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,420
may not necessarily preserve the area

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,290
relative to one another so you need to

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,420
be aware of this

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,830
um which brings us to our next slide

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,190
which is a little bit hyperbolic but

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,680
it's true every map is a liar every map

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,890
you look at is lying to you in some way

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,260
it is misleading you in some way and it

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,570
is necessary to know how it is lying to

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,560
you and how you can make your Maps lie

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,540
less so again I'm just going to outline

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,680
all the major land masses and I'm going

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,560
to take two of them I'm going to take

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,490
Africa and I'm going to take Greenland

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,140
I'm going to put them on top of each

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,640
other you'll notice we're using the web

00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,620
Mercator this is this is what we see in

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,149
all our web maps I'm gonna put them on

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,240
top of each other and they're about the

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:09,620
same size but what if I had a globe in

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,329
front of me and I was just looking

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,100
straight at the globe on to Africa and

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,740
then I tilt it around and I look

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,130
straight down on Greenland this is what

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,890
I get my map is lied to me and I didn't

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,290
even know it and this is sort of rampant

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,260
in a lot of what we see and in on a web

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,579
map a perfect 1 kilometer by 1 kilometer

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,380
square somewhere up in Greenland it's

00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,560
going to be a little bit stretchy and

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,810
it's it's important to know that so

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,430
again here's here's another projection I

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,620
like this is the u.s. national atlas

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,810
you'll see um there are curves on it

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,060
because it tries to preserve area and

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:48,709
shape for smaller region than the earth

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,750
but it's still not super great so now

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,279
we're going to look at lines I've just

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,950
got another web map open here and I'm

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,770
just drawing a line from two points all

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,180
right now I'm going to reproject it and

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,649
something that looks kind of 3d kind of

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,970
like a globe it's it's kind of a fun

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,310
projection to look at you can pretend

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,290
you're using a 3d program and you know

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,279
it gives you a better idea of how

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,350
everything relates to itself shape wise

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,300
but that last line I drew goes across

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,130
these coordinates not the ones I'm

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,800
looking at here so even a straight line

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,529
is not necessarily a straight line on a

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,089
map so we'll go back to this projection

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,459
and that on that map you looking one

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,529
that 3d cool looking one that straight

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:31,070
line that was straight on the on the 3d

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:33,430
map looks like a curve now so which one

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,430
is right

00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,179
nope neither of them that's because it

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,069
was 3d doesn't mean it was telling the

00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:43,429
truth what you need is a great circle

00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:45,949
line and what you usually do is since

00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:47,360
most mapping doesn't draw a straight

00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,040
line that's the correct straight line as

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,389
a curve is you're just going to put some

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,949
points in the middle of it so that it'll

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,410
continue so it'll render it in such a

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:55,939
way as to look like a curve and you'll

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,889
notice on that top line I did it with

00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:59,869
just you know six or seven points in the

00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,119
middle so you can't so you can tell I'm

00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:04,279
doing that but in the other ones in that

00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:07,670
middle one I've done like 15 or so so on

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,970
line to you in that it's not actually a

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,339
single line it's a bunch of lines so the

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,929
pipe raj project has actually had a

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,999
really nice function I was surprised to

00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,550
see how easy it was to do so I created

00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,129
wgs84 ellipsoid and then I just get a

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,050
number of points in between and for this

00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:28,429
example we're doing twelve points this

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,050
doesn't include the start and end and in

00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,670
arcgis it's a little bit more work

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,069
because there's no dedicated function to

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,779
do it the big thing is in that middle

00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:38,600
section using the positional online

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,790
operator on a unaligned geometry to get

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,959
more lines that you can use to densify

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,809
your polygon there your line so again

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,129
we're going to look at a map from this

00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,929
was this is a reproduction of a map that

00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:53,720
was in a major magazine recently about

00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:57,319
the the missile range of certain North

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,999
Korean missiles it looks it looks kind

00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,360
of scary you know those those one orange

00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:04,010
missiles can go through half the United

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,100
States and pretty much all Europe it's

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,919
kind of weird but just because these

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,850
ranges are perfect circle's doesn't mean

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,059
that we're being told the truth

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,559
again this map is lying to us and we

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,110
don't realize it because you know we

00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:21,199
think of ranges as perfect circles and

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,819
this map has perfect circles on it what

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,439
they would actually look like if it were

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,059
if it took the shape of the earth into

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,439
account if it took a geographic

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,190
coordinate system into account rather

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,070
than just numbers on a on a screen as

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:36,549
this so you can imagine you've just lied

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,380
with a map on accident it looked fine

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:42,919
but can you imagine delivering that

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,330
first map to a to a leader of some sort

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,169
who's making international policy

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,929
decisions based on the information

00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:51,379
given them that is incorrect so it's

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,080
important to know these things and

00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:57,149
always take gee Odyssey into account um

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,059
switch to a non projected coordinate

00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:03,210
system when you can um there are a lot

00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,009
of tools to help you with that um but do

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,259
not just go by those decimal numbers

00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:09,749
that you get from a GPS fix don't buffer

00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:12,799
by that how long is a single decimal

00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:16,230
degree on a GPS fix what's the distance

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,720
there is none it's arbitrary it changes

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,889
from north to south and east to west

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,590
depending on where you are one degree of

00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:26,340
latitude or longitude is a different

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,409
length of real measure and then from

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,539
there we can go into analysis we've

00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,279
we've built up a system that we can

00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,289
understand the earth about by first

00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,989
getting an idea of how the earth is

00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:38,249
shaped first we're going to have a grid

00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,720
we're going to get an idea of what the

00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,830
either the whole earth looks like or

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,100
we're just going to go relative to a

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:46,169
point in meters and then we're going to

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,119
go ahead and put it on screen by

00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:50,850
reducing summarize by reducing one

00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,619
degree of resolution going from 3d to

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,379
two-dimensional and we can look at our

00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,119
coordinates with analysis you're just

00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:58,830
doing stuff with spatial data you don't

00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,330
have to worry about the projection you

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:04,369
usually throw it away and go back to

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:06,539
geographic to really well-defined

00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:09,720
problems that you will see a lot are

00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,999
geocoding which if you generalize it out

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,149
far enough is just mapping text to space

00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,159
and network analysis which has two

00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:18,899
different flavors the one you're most

00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,669
used to is probably getting driving

00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:22,440
directions where you're an independent

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,259
agent working through a graph data set

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,529
the other one measures overall holistic

00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:31,350
flow in it in a in a graph data set

00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,389
Network for example there if there's a

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,039
windstorm and a power line goes down how

00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:37,350
many houses are going to be affected if

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,320
I've got this water pipe and it has this

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,539
capacity how many can I how many more

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,519
mains can I branch off of before it goes

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:47,429
becomes you know dangerously low flow

00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,499
things like that and then we get into

00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,059
just bread and butter spatial analysis

00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:52,649
where we do relational and topological

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,940
operators this is where you piece

00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:57,179
together your own tools your own

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,970
analysis with with the with some basic

00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,280
tools um that are provided and open

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,660
source and in the ArcGIS stack so the

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,220
relational operators they just take two

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,440
geometries and they will return true or

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,120
false the one you probably care about

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,300
most is point in polygon which is uh

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,400
intersects which doesn't exist at least

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,160
in the traditional definition so what

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,350
you really want to use is the disjoint

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,610
operator you want to use not disjoint

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,970
you want to use the opposite of the

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,860
destroying operator to figure out what

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,210
points are in your polygons this this

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,830
this also applies to Postgres

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,210
topological operators take a to

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,030
geometries and they will do something

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,620
real relative with them usually the most

00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,770
part of stuff you do with Venn diagrams

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,120
plus a little bit of extra cool stuff so

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,380
you've got your two polygons you can do

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,140
a union you can give them both together

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,670
you can do a subtraction you get the

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,750
difference between the one you can do an

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:56,630
intersection you can do a symmetric

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:59,850
difference you can do you can do a

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,160
convex hull which finds that the minimum

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,380
bounding geometry of a of a group of

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,550
geometries and then there's the buffer

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,590
which is the fun one and again it's

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,140
fairly easy to it's fairly easy to do

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,090
with the tools provided um I wasn't able

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,300
to do this in a spatial reference

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:22,050
agnostic way in fionna unfortunately so

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,210
I didn't post it but um for the most

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,260
part you know if you're doing just

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,940
simple point in polygons you probably

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,500
want to do something within a distance

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,020
so you will buffer your points and then

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,920
you'll find which points intersect it

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:37,080
and so well a lot of spatial data is on

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,600
the web you still have to use the

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,240
desktop for the most part to do some

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,610
processing and analysis of it there are

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,100
two desktop suites available one open

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,860
source well there are a lot of ailable

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,330
but the two that support python well are

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,280
one quantum GIS which is open source

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,350
you'll see nice little Python prompt

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,570
down there and you can open maps and

00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,250
open post GIS and shape files and that

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,670
sort of thing and then there's the

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,620
ArcGIS suite with the desktop which also

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,200
has a nice little Python prompt and lets

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:12,450
you do pretty much all the same things

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,150
and quite a bit more um and I ran quite

00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,940
a bit early

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:20,160
but I have to say from the point of view

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,380
of a Python developer learning spatial I

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,060
think the most important part is

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,220
learning the idea of the coordinate

00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,600
system learning the idea that you don't

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,300
just have these numbers from negative

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,650
180 to 180 and negative 90 to 90 there's

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,230
something underlying there's a

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,390
theoretical underpinning that you have

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,370
that you need to understand and need to

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,570
be able to translate into something more

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,220
appropriate especially if you're doing

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,510
something like a buffer you're finding

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,730
that your closest neighbors that sort of

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,970
thing and that math is mostly

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,610
implemented in C++ and C so you're going

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,220
to probably be using a lot of them a lot

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,310
of open-source C Python extensions to do

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,570
this there there are slowly becoming

00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,720
more and more pure Python

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,160
implementations of these things and I

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
mean that's good but for the most part

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,140
you're going to be using probably PI

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,670
proj Shapley on the open source side and

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,740
then there's a new one called Fiona for

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,630
doing actual analysis and not just doing

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,430
spatial relationships and then on the

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,070
ArcGIS stack it's just sort of all baked

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,870
in um so again all the slides are online

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,430
with some links on that first link and

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,940
there is also a dedicated Stack Exchange

00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,920
to GIS I recommend you visit that and

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,660
just read all the most favorited and

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,480
most viewed posts to get a little bit

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,560
more of an idea of what's going on

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,900
Python is kind of the the factor

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,340
language for GIS the same way that it's

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,890
kind of taken over scientific computing

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,380
but quite a bit more so so as a Python

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,450
developer you already are 90% of the way

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,520
there to being a good GIS developer it's

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,870
just a matter of building a fundamental

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:51,350
understanding of the way that spatial

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:55,780
data works and apply it so thank

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,780
[Applause]

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,030
um so when you were showing the

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,500
Cartesian map of the US states I was

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,970
wondering where those divisions came

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,580
from are they corresponding to like

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,530
different altitudes their religious

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,390
you'll notice go back to it you'll

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,430
notice that they're mostly largely just

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,680
either very long east-west or very long

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,210
north-south coordinates they're fairly

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,330
arbitrary they were based on a survey

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,090
from the 1930s um to cut up the earth to

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:34,580
cut up the United States into into

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,470
regions um they're arbitrary for the

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,960
most part they try to avoid major major

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,920
metro areas and they tend to be very far

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,880
either east-west or north-south to

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,820
minimize the distortion and because they

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:52,670
all have a specific projection that they

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:54,380
go along with as well well I have a

00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,960
question I mean not being so familiar

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,190
with the the GIS side of Python I mean

00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,570
how much how much interaction if they

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,790
had with sort of the scientific

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,680
computing Oh crowded cuz I was in I was

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,660
in the ipython tutorial the other day I

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,130
was saying man this would be really

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,930
interesting if you could do mapping and

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,270
like ipython notebook or something do

00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,070
you know what's there anything's good

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:16,430
other scientific computing yes there

00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,320
actually is a project third third party

00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,450
optional add-on to matplotlib that will

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,860
let you draw maps and a few coordinates

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,440
so you can just throw your spatial data

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,770
in straight from that way um and again

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,900
on the on the GIS side for raster data

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,780
especially it's a natural fit for numpy

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,090
arrays and the RTI stack supports it and

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,750
I believe that some of the open source

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,850
stuff is catching up as well because I

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,100
mean they go together very well GIS is

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,200
basically just a very specific flavor of

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,760
scientific by scientific computing and

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,900
there's a little bit of isolation

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,180
because it's not necessarily the same

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,500
scientific community but yes there there

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,230
is quite a bit of overlap in there you

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,570
can do maps pretty easily in in

00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,980
matplotlib and in an IP I thought we use

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,400
my Python pretty much extends

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:05,270
exclusively at work as the other as in

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,990
the other direction do we have any more

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,860
questions

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,220
okay thank you very much that was great

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,120
oh wait wait wait wait okay wait okay

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,860
don't want to jump could you explain

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,840
real quick the North Korean map again

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,570
that was okay completely sure if the

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:23,650
shaded reason regions was where they can

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,840
yeah so basically we're building a

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,690
buffer of a certain distance around

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,580
North Korea so we want just the range

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,870
within I think it's six thousand and ten

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,690
thousand miles I don't remember the

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,570
numbers it looks right here because you

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,250
would imagine a range to be a circle but

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,140
there's distortion on this map because

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,300
it is a Mercator projection it is not

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,130
necessarily what the surface of the

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,720
earth looks like this is what it would

00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,010
look this is what it would look like if

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,450
it were correct and we can play around

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,210
with some projections to kind of give

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:56,320
you an idea of what you can do with this

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,880
stuff um close on this stuff out so this

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,710
is this is the web Mercator projection

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,880
actually this is what you usually see on

00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:07,060
a web map um kind of the implicit the

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,220
implicit projection that you see in

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,910
Google Maps or whatever but you can play

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:15,040
around with projections actually here um

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,560
if we pick another one that might be a

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,660
little bit better um you know you've

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,460
probably seen projections like this

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,770
where they try to maintain the curvature

00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:31,660
of the earth you've probably seen this

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:32,710
one in in your textbooks here for to

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,720
finish rendering but you've you've

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,550
probably seen these um there are a lot

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,900
of different projections you're losing

00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,060
you're losing some sort of spatial data

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,380
you're losing some sort of information

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,270
in the relationship between the shapes

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,830
on a three-dimensional surface whenever

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,300
you flatten it onto a map so yeah you

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,050
can also get crazy stuff like the fuller

00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:55,270
projection that programmers which

00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:57,790
equidistant one um I will do a conic so

00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,560
this one everything it aligned in any

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:03,070
length is the same distance from the

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,140
point of origin it's this map it

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,240
actually would be a circle yes well if

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,450
if the center of the map if it's

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,750
centered otherwise it would be otherwise

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:16,240
distorted correct so you usually go with

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,970
a conic projection system where you're

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,470
looking at a single point basically

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,720
you've got a cylindrical projection

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,940
you're just cutting a seam in the earth

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,990
at some prime meridian and flattening it

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,010
out you're taking you're basically

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,200
cutting down the center of an orange

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,730
peel and you're pushed slamming it down

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,040
onto a piece of paper so that it's flat

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,330
um other ones are conic projections

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,940
where you're basically looking down at

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,680
the orange and you cut off cut off half

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,900
of the orange and just stick it down on

00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,090
a piece of paper and you just look at it

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:49,200
as half the earth just straight down at

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:52,660
it um

00:28:49,200 --> 00:29:00,090
not I couldn't do it easily right now no

00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:03,010
I have to yeah that would be a good way

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,370
but it's just it's just amazing how much

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,690
we take Maps for granted and how you

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:15,850
know how little we know about them

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:18,930
really so I have a question how come the

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:21,730
fuller projections crazy um remember

00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,670
Buckminster Fuller with all his geodesic

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,010
jaw I know tons about him I'm from his

00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,170
Institute actually so it's just very

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,060
confusing because the way that it why

00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,110
don't you put it up there so you send it

00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:40,450
back to my it's obviously a very

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:41,680
interesting up Twitter this it's a

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,350
really good map because it's not

00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,970
distorted consorted right we always call

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,280
the other people's maps crazy so I'm

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,960
interested to come up to your world it's

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,640
just very non-conventional well very

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,800
very but it folds up into a polyhedron

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,360
so it's yeah it's really cool because

00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,640
you can fold it up it's it's really

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,950
mathematically interesting it's um an

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,480
answer he has it and we're so we're very

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,360
pleased about that you know I should get

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,720
marketing kudos for that yeah I mean

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,920
it's it's really cool to look at it's um

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,780
it's just hard to communicate data

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,970
effectively to a non-expert it's also

00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,790
good for showing how missiles go because

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,020
they'll go north south east west well

00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,030
yeah that's that's another good point

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,250
yeah and see a very good cold war map

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,390
and so yeah for that

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:27,179
I suppose so because yeah you go to UM

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,919
you're going from too far away here but

00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:31,140
yeah you're going from like Pyongyang to

00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,080
Seattle you can see the relationship

00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,419
quite a bit better with this map yes um

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,490
you had those two slides with all the

00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,830
operators yes do you think we could take

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:44,750
a couple minutes to go over one briefly

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,750
sure since we have a bunch of time

00:30:45,679 --> 00:31:00,000
further down huh sure um so so yeah can

00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,380
contains it's um I was I was talking

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,110
about disjoint because this that

00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,360
includes if it's um if it's on the line

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,610
or within the shape contains means it

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,289
has to be completely within crosses is

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,720
for two lines basically if the two lines

00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:15,360
touch each other but they don't overlap

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,179
this joint is again if they have nothing

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,570
in common whatsoever uncle's you know

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,669
same thing overlaps basically two

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,070
polygons or two two lines that's just

00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:28,049
sort of Venn diagram over each other

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,539
touches again is one of those things

00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:32,039
where like you've got a dot a point

00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,200
right on the edge of a line or a polygon

00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,299
or you've got like a line that goes

00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,250
along the edge of another line on a

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,870
polygon something like that and then

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,840
within you know it's again another

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,750
completely contains and then the

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,919
topological ones are a little more these

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,750
ones give you back geometries the other

00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,900
ones give you back true false so these

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,210
ones with the geometries are these are

00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:58,110
the more interesting spatial ones Oreo

00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:00,299
um where you can actually see see what's

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,710
going on it's not just a test of true or

00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,049
false but you're getting back a new

00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:09,510
geometry from doing something to these

00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:11,340
geometries and the slides are online and

00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,929
I think I included a link to some rjs

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,710
help that explains us a little bit

00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,710
better than I can

00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:30,660
yes what what's the advantage of using

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,280
the Python judo bindings um basically

00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,320
yeah you do get the full API

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,850
implementation the full object model

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
that you can talk to through Python so

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,220
if you're doing something in Python

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,130
that's something you probably want to do

00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,740
the ogre project for the vector data um

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,300
Shawn who was a runner actually

00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,430
implemented a really nice wrapper for

00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,570
called shapely and he's also done some

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,910
really nice work

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,070
he just recently released a version of a

00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:56,010
library called Fiona for doing cursors

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,650
on spatial data as well so that might be

00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:05,059
something to look into to us to evaluate

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:07,200
spatial data any more questions okay

00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:11,739
okay thank you very much

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,739
