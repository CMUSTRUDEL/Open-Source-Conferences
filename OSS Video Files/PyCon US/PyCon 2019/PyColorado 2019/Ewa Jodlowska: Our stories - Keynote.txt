00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,000
all right so executive director is

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,170
Python Software Foundation and for those

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,970
of you that don't know what the Python

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,440
Software Foundation is I guarantee you

00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:58,890
you will know at the end of this talk so

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,170
my story as a child who immigrated to

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,930
the US I always had a hard time fitting

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,000
in when we first came here I didn't

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,979
speak the language my family didn't

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,440
speak the language we weren't familiar

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,570
with the customs and we had a difficult

00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:22,229
time recreating the life that we had

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:25,880
abroad some of that followed me everyone

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,880
hear me okay some of that followed me

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,490
we're good to my adulthood especially

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,160
when it came time to picking what I

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,470
wanted to do for the rest of my life

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,390
nothing I ever did felt like it fit and

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,600
I struggled with this for many years

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,100
when I graduated high school I didn't go

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,950
to a university like everyone else

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,410
because I had no idea what I wanted to

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,229
do I didn't see a clear path for myself

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,789
nor did I feel a great passion for

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,550
anything specific like my fellow

00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:58,739
graduates did I attended a local

00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,080
Community College for several years and

00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,000
worked part time I took classes that

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,770
were interesting to me I took several

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,810
semesters of early child education

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,840
classes thinking that maybe I wanted to

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,700
be a teacher I learned I loved learning

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,319
about history so maybe I'd be a

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,090
historian but then I thought what kind

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,610
of jobs would be available to me

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,230
I even dabbled in philosophy a little

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,830
bit but turned out I did not like that

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,530
at all when I was about 20 years old

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,959
someone I knew recommended a job to me

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,970
and they told me that this job involved

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,680
a lot of traveling so that sparked a lot

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,290
of interest for me because at that time

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,980
I was young single and still living with

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,980
my parents I applied and luckily I was

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,780
hired for the job and at that same time

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,660
I stopped thinking about what my greater

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,360
calling in life was the company that I

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,950
went to work for they are still around

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,750
and they currently provide a wide

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,840
variety

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,910
services to conferences all over the US

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,520
those services include meeting planning

00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:03,920
project management even registration and

00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:07,340
housing apps so here is where I learned

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,860
how to organize conferences here is also

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,940
where I learned how to program using in

00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:17,180
informix 4gl in PHP I ended up working

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,750
for this company for seven years but

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,959
something amazing happen to this job I

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,239
worked my first PyCon in 2008 I started

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,190
by helping volunteers organized the

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,770
conference and eventually I helped

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,239
develop the first PyCon registration and

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:37,910
housing app that would be managed by a

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,120
professional service what an eye-opening

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,290
experience PyCon was for me I

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,209
experienced what our community had to

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,160
offer from the start

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:51,830
I felt inclusion a welcoming nature the

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,630
desire to raise each other up the

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,470
ability to work together to overcome

00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,410
obstacles looking back I guess prior to

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,540
going PyCon I never experienced or felt

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,799
these attributes or characteristics in

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:09,860
any of the other communities I met so

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,049
PyCon 2008 turned out to be a turning

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,299
point for me in my life in the fall of

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,910
that year I signed up for night school

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,440
and was determined to get my CS degree

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,240
because I found a place

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,190
I fit I found the pipeline community

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,720
with the help of our community I started

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,080
to see my path forward

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,180
I knew right after PyCon 2008 that being

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,290
part of this community is what I wanted

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,470
to do so funny enough my night courses

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:43,280
only covered Java and C++

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,200
and even more ironically I didn't expect

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,930
to one day be the executive director of

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,550
the PSF which let me tell you involves

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,110
zero coding all that aside I am sure

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,330
that my computer science degree helped

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,190
shape Who I am today but I'm more

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:03,770
convinced that our community helped

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:06,680
shape Who I am today everyone sitting

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,380
here has been somehow impacted by Python

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,930
in its community or will be for the

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,500
first time at this conference will

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,110
forever carry around our stories because

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,080
that's how Python changed our lives all

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,180
of your stories my story the stories

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,690
from all around the world are what make

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,080
python special more so no two stories

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:35,840
are the same they are what makes our

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,150
community so the Python Software

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,460
Foundation tries to embody all of that

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,820
and be the support for all of us so we

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,190
can have our own stories to tell the PSF

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,470
submission is to foster python in its

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,230
community its mission is to create a

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,600
community that empowers people no matter

00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,600
where they live the language they speak

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,210
the color of their skin their age and so

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,130
much more so they can have their own

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,220
impactful Python story our entire

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:08,390
community and the PSF work together to

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,990
sustain pythons ecosystem an ecosystem

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:14,330
where through diversity inclusion

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,090
education trademark protection financial

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,760
support and so much more we continue to

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,580
grow a community and therefore fostering

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,530
a support system for one another and you

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,330
might ask why is it important that we

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:31,520
focus on all this today the answer to

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,400
that question can honestly be a talk in

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,169
itself but the short answer is python is

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,470
an open source language and it's driven

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:42,860
by its community it's driven by

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:46,610
collaboration by transparency we all

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,130
need to know what drives Python Python

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,889
code is an important component of our

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,780
ecosystem it is the common

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:58,879
that we all have sitting in this room

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:01,939
but we are more important without us it

00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,680
would cease to exist the beginners the

00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,770
users the contributors the core

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,259
developers even the core the creator of

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,409
the language himself all the people

00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:16,789
behind Python the interactions we have

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:19,759
are what shaped the code because of this

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:25,189
we are invested in Python and that's why

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,840
it's important so how does the PSF

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:31,069
support this vast community

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,819
what's the PSF story so the PSF story

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:37,219
began in 2001 it was started by a couple

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,750
of pythonista 'he's one of them is

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:43,250
sitting right here in this very first

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:45,319
row Paul Everett 18 years ago the PSF

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:50,479
board directors started to pave the way

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:53,330
for our PSF today from the start they

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,069
worked on getting a few sponsors which

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,279
when I was looking through some of the

00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:01,520
minutes I think it was about $17,000 in

00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,199
the first year they created a place for

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Communications to happen within our

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,819
community they started to vote in

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,009
members to the PSF they decided how they

00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,169
were gonna run the Python conference and

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,569
what was the PSFS place in the community

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:23,240
and let me tell you a lot has changed

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:26,000
since then it's evident that the PSF has

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,699
grown tremendously over the years just

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,729
like our community has that growth has

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:34,519
empowered the PSF to do more for our

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:37,550
community during the early years the PSF

00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,010
supported community work 100% by

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,709
volunteer efforts and over the years as

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,000
the work that we did increased we learn

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:47,329
that that was not a hundred percent

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,640
sustainable even though we do use

00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:52,070
volunteers to do a lot of the work we

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,890
now have a staff when I started with the

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,170
PSF I was one of two employees now we're

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,000
seven the more employees that we have

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,490
the more initiatives that we can work on

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,500
the more financial support that the PSF

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,100
gets the more financial support we could

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,060
provide to our

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,060
community the PSF now runs several

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,370
impactful services and I'd like us all

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,410
to take a look at each of these by

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,250
reflecting on what the PSF did last year

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,990
in 2018 as I go through and explain what

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,910
are sort of what our spending was for

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,589
each of these services I'll also try to

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,000
update you for the current things that

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,589
are happening with these services so the

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,899
following charts that I'm going to share

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,810
with you are from the PSFS first annual

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,600
impact report we created the first

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,490
annual impact report earlier this year

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,889
to achieve greater transparency with our

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,470
community on how much money the PSF does

00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:47,569
receive and how we spend it so the

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,889
report online shows much more detail

00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:50,389
than what I'll show you today so if

00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,970
you're interested in learning more about

00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:54,949
our finances and our growth please feel

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,079
free to check out this bitly link or if

00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:59,050
you want to follow along through some of

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,550
the charts please go ahead check it out

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,620
so we've received really awesome

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,750
positive feedback about this report from

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,399
our community so we'll be sure to do

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,819
this kind of thing every year so in

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:15,319
January of 2020 we we definitely plan on

00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:17,329
having the impact report for 2019 so

00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:21,319
let's dive in and take a look at PyCon

00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:24,019
us looking at the program service chart

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,720
we see that the largest piece of the

00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:30,230
spending pie goes towards making PyCon

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,180
happen the PSF produces PyCon it's a

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,750
huge conference with a lot of moving

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,449
parts to give you some comparisons to

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,819
show the growth over the years the

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:45,079
Python conference in 2002 had a budget

00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:48,860
of approximately $30,000 as we see here

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:53,000
PyCon 2008 cost more than one and a half

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:56,329
a million dollars PyCon 2008 was less

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,250
than 1,500 people now PyCon sells out

00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:01,910
every year at about three thousand five

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,850
hundred attendees the process of Pi con

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,949
is resource heavy most of our staff

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,740
spends at least six months out of the

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:12,470
year working on Python in August of last

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,959
year in 2008 the PSF hired its first

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,459
full-time employee that only works on

00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,279
she works on like on all year-round

00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:23,130
which is amazing and to give you an idea

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,529
of how far in advance we work our team

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,139
is working on starting the planning for

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,240
Pike on 22 23 and at the end of this

00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:35,190
year they're gonna start working on 24

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:39,000
25 which just blows my mind in addition

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,490
to time PyCon requires a lot of money to

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,009
happen even though we try to be very

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,000
thrifty and how we run Pike on it is

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:49,800
still a massive expense for the PSF

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,050
PyCon has grown to be the largest Python

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,449
conference in the world and it is also

00:11:52,050 --> 00:12:01,050
the largest source of revenue for the

00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:02,250
PSF in 2008 pythons revenue was 83% of

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,009
the PSFS

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,440
total revenue if python doesn't have a

00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:10,079
good year the PSF might not have enough

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,350
funds to cover our Grants Program or to

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,310
pay for its overhead PyCon is also the

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,319
longest pike on it totals nine days we

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,589
have two full days of tutorials three

00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:24,600
conference days in four sprint days even

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,610
though many attendees cannot make it for

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,470
the full duration we do have hundreds of

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,300
people that do and to me that just

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,350
emphasizes the dedication of our

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,449
community every year we attempt to

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,279
provide a remarkable experience for our

00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:40,500
community similar to what Scott was

00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:45,569
describing as their process here for pi

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:49,470
Colorado was we try to keep prices low

00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:51,600
we provide day care we provide financial

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,670
assistance for those that need it we

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,860
provide many networking opportunities

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,959
for our attendees and we also try to

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,819
provide a wide variety of skill level

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,230
content

00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,360
additionally we make sure that all of

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,579
the content is publicly available within

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,980
a couple of hours so those that cannot

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,019
attend PyCon can still see all of our

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,889
tutorials in all of our talks online

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:16,050
within a day or two so a few weeks ago

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:19,170
I'm super happy to announce that our

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,730
team launched the PyCon 2020 site for

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,230
those of you interested and go on a pike

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,730
on I recommend you check it out

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,120
registration isn't open yet but it will

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,220
be in

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,260
two months and for those that are

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,920
interested in proposing a talk our CFP

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,920
will open next week

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:39,120
so next we have our awards program so

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,850
this was started in 2008 the PSF loves

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,100
to recognize community members that have

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,320
a positive impact on Python's community

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,810
the process here is pretty simple

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,230
through this email email address that

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,390
you see here PSF at python.org the PSF

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,330
accepts nominations for for community

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,860
service awards quarterly the PSF board

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,390
directors review all of these

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,430
nominations that we receive and they

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,500
select two to four Award winners per

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,779
quarter we also have something called

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,850
the Distinguished Service Award which is

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,400
the highest level of recognition that

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,740
someone can receive from the PSF this

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,560
award is decided by the board directors

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,110
and is given to community members that

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,470
have positively impacted Python for a

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,110
sustained period of time so these awards

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,330
come with a cash prize because we feel

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,250
that is a good way to show our

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,950
appreciation to our volunteers who are

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,560
all over the world we could we give out

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,660
about ten awards a year and so this

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,209
expense is small when you compare it to

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,070
something like Python for example but we

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,900
do feel that this type of recognition is

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,770
important to our volunteers and is

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:49,650
important to our community growth anyone

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,600
can nominate a deserving member so if

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,520
you know of anyone that should be

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,220
recognized for their volunteer efforts I

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,959
encourage you to nominate them if you

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,270
feel like you don't want to email PSF at

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:06,720
Python org feel free to tell me I will

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:08,190
nominate them on your behalf so next up

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,020
let's take a look at our fiscal

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,529
sponsorship program this is somewhat

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:16,890
unique this program allows projects that

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,930
follow the PSFS mission to join our

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,570
organization and to receive certain

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,910
benefits these benefits include

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,130
accounting help and the ability to

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,940
absorb our nonprofit status so they can

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,040
receive tax-exempt donations the process

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,329
for this program requires that the PSF

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,059
staff audit the projects that are

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,459
interested in joining this is mainly a

00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,230
risk assessment because if we do accept

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,319
a project that is not aligned with our

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,850
mission we can lose our nonprofit status

00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,709
we have to determine that the project

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,410
fits our mission and that it aligns with

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:52,869
the services that we provide one of the

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,720
prop once a project is accepted we

00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,790
create a specific donation page that is

00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,589
just meant for this project and they can

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,309
use that to bring in donations for the

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:04,839
project the funding that comes in for

00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,989
our fiscal sponsorship groups is

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,569
earmarked for their use only so the

00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:13,899
expenses that we see in our annual

00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:15,819
impact report is from the money that

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,040
they have raised themselves for their

00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:19,720
use so in a way they are part of our

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,429
general budget but at the same time

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,029
they're not because we don't use it for

00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:27,129
general PSF expenses so since our staff

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,019
internally has been growing we've been

00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,779
able to offer this service to more and

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:34,179
more projects so currently we offer it

00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,699
to several user groups and conferences

00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:40,059
in the US as well as the palates project

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:42,309
which is home to projects like Jinja and

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:48,399
flasks and we also house the pilot

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:50,259
project so as many of you know the PSF

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,899
also maintains infrastructure that our

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,410
community uses on a daily basis this

00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:57,369
includes

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,980
pipey I saw python.org Python org so I

00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:02,110
want us to briefly touch on the moss

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,910
grant that the PSA I've received a few

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,510
years back since it was a significant

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,059
amount of money that we spend in 2018 so

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,159
the PSF received a grant from mozilla

00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:15,010
open source support to finish the pie

00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:17,169
pie codebase which is known as as

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,389
warehouse and launch it so this was the

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,730
first time that the PSF ever received a

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:23,470
directed grant for such work so the

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,899
process for this grant required that the

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:30,130
PSF hire three contractors and execute

00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:31,720
the grant as it was stated so thanks to

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,539
those contractors and all the volunteers

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,399
have contributed to that project it went

00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,460
smoothly and lots of improvements were

00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:42,100
implemented the PSF worker that works on

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,350
packaging is actively seeking additional

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,900
grants so they can continue to improve

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,480
pipey i'm packaging for our community

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,940
recently the workgroup opened up a

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,860
request for information phase for the

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,720
next set of security improvements that

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,580
will be working on thanks to a Facebook

00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,620
grant that we received if you are

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,420
interested in this topic check out this

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,559
bitly link at the bottom here the pie

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,880
pie - q4 link at the bottom of the page

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,170
for more information you can also

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:17,530
partake in the discussions that are

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:20,350
happening so next up we have the PSFS

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,260
Grants Program to me this is the most

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,570
impactful and meaningful program service

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,429
that the PSF provides I work with a

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,850
great group of people from all around

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:33,460
the world and through this effort and

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,900
the PSFS grants working group we give

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,900
out hundreds of thousands of dollars to

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,670
support a variety of initiatives all

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,280
around the world so how does this

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,990
process work we have an online forum

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,570
where anyone around the world can submit

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,990
a grant request the request could be for

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,660
python training workshops conferences

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:55,120
development and much more I included a

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,320
link here at the top for those of you

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,780
that are interested in learning more

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,640
about the program or are interested in

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,350
submitting your grant request to read

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,809
more about it so the grant or group

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,210
reviews the requests that come in and we

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,059
use a lot of local input when necessary

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:14,020
to gauge the effectiveness of what we're

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:15,790
funding to to to these events the group

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,040
devotes a lot of their time to the

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,470
success of this program and I have to

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,200
say we receive a lot of them almost on a

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,510
daily basis in this group which is all

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,110
volunteers outside of me works all year

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,230
round

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:33,010
so far this year we reviewed over 150

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,559
grant requests part of the grant

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,840
expenses that the PSF oversees is for

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,900
the PSF Ambassador Program this means

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,660
that we allot a larger budget to a group

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,190
or person in a particular part of the

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,380
world where Python is just being

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,830
established for the past two years the

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,670
PSF has been funding a group in Uganda

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,830
to do outreach in in East Africa they do

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,330
a lot of outreach at university level

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,190
and they also put a

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,160
I've heard into introducing people with

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,130
accessibility needs into our community

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,690
so when we add it all up in 2018 the PSF

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,760
spent three hundred and thirty four

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,980
thousand dollars on grants

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,380
this map shows us how that money was

00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,120
split around the world we see Python

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,940
activity happening all over the world

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,510
the only place we haven't funded yet is

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,370
Antarctica but I did recently read that

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,560
last year someone hosted a software

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,970
carpentry class in Antarctica so I think

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,040
it's only a matter of time before we

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,340
have our first hike on Antarctica in

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,380
case anyone wants to volunteer the grand

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,930
support that we provide is increasing

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,930
worldwide in general the total amount of

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:44,350
grant funding increased 48 percent

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,940
between 2015 and 2018 I think that is a

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,470
telling sign that our community is

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,910
growing and becoming more of a global

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:54,580
community so now that you have an idea

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,860
of what the PSF does let's take a look

00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,900
at what's in store for the PSF we've

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,400
been busy this year so that there's a

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,370
lot that's gonna be happening in the

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,890
very near future the PSF launched its

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,870
initiative for python in education

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,690
earlier this year through various

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,490
workshops open spaces and various

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,460
communications it became evident to the

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,340
PSF that Python and education could use

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,130
some support the PSF initiative went

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,930
through a request for ideas phase where

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,270
we gathered input from the community as

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,800
to what they thought we should support

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,600
using that information we moved on to

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,760
the request for proposal phase and

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,940
through that we received 20 proposals

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,130
our goal was to select proposals that

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,030
would have global reach and not just

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,200
regional so we concentrated it on Python

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,180
and education for mobile

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,190
localization as well as resources for

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,760
educators after reviewing those

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:51,460
proposals we selected three of them so

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,250
the first proposal that we accepted was

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,620
for B where the PSF will be funding the

00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,220
B where project to work on Python and

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:02,260
Android there are more Android users in

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,660
the world than any other mobile platform

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,540
users we believe that a wider audience

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,430
will be able to access Python and

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,160
Python once it's easily available on

00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,960
mobile we will be sharing more updates

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,030
on this project we are Twitter and our

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,780
blog so please do follow us for more

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:23,410
updates on that so additionally the PSF

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,330
wanted awarded a grant for for to a

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,080
community member to work on curating

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,090
resources that are already out there

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,400
there are endless amounts of projects

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:38,260
and curriculums available online like

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,030
this excerpt that we see here from from

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,030
the young coders tutorial that we use at

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,890
PyCon us so some resources are great

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,810
that are out there and some may be less

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,420
so so this person is going to work

00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,730
through curating and and auditing what's

00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,380
out there and make it easier for those

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,490
that want to teach Python to find

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,580
resources to do so

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,250
so if we can have the most powerful

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,020
resources together in one area the

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:06,580
easier for people all around the world

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:08,890
to teach Python lastly is a project

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,750
called friendly trace backs this project

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,730
is not in need of financial support but

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,710
they are asking the PSF to help promote

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,380
their efforts so friendly trace back

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,050
aims to provide simplified trace back

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,630
translated into as many languages as

00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,550
possible so the project maintainer is

00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,190
looking for volunteers to help with

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,530
tasks such as documenting possible

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,360
syntax error use cases and documenting

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,790
exceptions that haven't already been

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,400
covered so please check out this bitly

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,630
link here for the full call to action

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,480
from the maintainer if you're interested

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,040
in joining their effort so these three

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,450
projects that we just briefly went over

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,490
are just the beginning of the PSFS

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,890
effort to help improve and strengthen

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,240
Python in education and we hope to do

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,770
these kinds of grants on a yearly basis

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,120
so over the last few years the PS have

00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,550
really upped its game and community

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,680
support as we see Python has grown our

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,720
grants program has grown we are at the

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,020
point where we're looking to improve the

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,040
support for core development as well

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,590
I've been working with the steering

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,140
council to figure out how the PSF can

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,119
support core development in August of

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,579
this year the PSF approved

00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,179
our proposal that we put together to

00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:20,799
hire a contractor to help with Python to

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,639
sunset which is going to be happening in

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,829
a few months so this work will include

00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:29,619
creating a place for our community that

00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:32,379
folks can use as guidance it includes

00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:35,709
doing press releases auditing links on

00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:38,199
Python org Docs a python.org updating

00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:40,359
any mentions of Python to communicating

00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:42,369
with our stakeholders publicizing

00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:43,719
resources for our community as well as

00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:47,979
helping answer questions from the

00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:50,049
community and this is just the starting

00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:51,579
point for what the PSF plans to help

00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,579
with when it comes to core development

00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:56,319
and supporting maintenance our hope is

00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:59,319
to come up with additional proposals

00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,929
even this year where the PSF can help

00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:05,319
fund things such as moving python from

00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:07,359
bugs python.org to github for example or

00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,039
upgrading the process that we use for

00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,199
contributor license agreements because

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,309
right now is a nightmare

00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,989
after we address the workflow

00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:17,199
improvements for core development the

00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:19,209
PSF wants to help wants to help make

00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:22,149
sure that python stays strong for the

00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:24,639
years to come sustainability for our

00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:27,189
community and for our language is our

00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:29,349
top priority for those of you that

00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:32,679
haven't seen Russell Keith McGee's

00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:34,989
keynote from Python 2019 I highly

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,389
recommend it to you all here's a link to

00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:39,849
to the talk on YouTube it talks about

00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:43,629
why we need to address longevity of

00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:46,719
Python and how we can all help I'll

00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:48,819
admit when I watch this live at PyCon I

00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:50,619
was emotionally moved by this talk and I

00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:54,819
hope that you will all find time to

00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:57,219
watch it so I'm gonna talk quickly

00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,739
because I'm running out of time so it

00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:02,829
all comes down all the aspects that I've

00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:06,579
touched on come down to people right it

00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:09,009
comes down to you this is Colorado's

00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:11,499
first Python conference it is the

00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:13,629
beginning of something great and the

00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:16,989
next big step that your community is

00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:19,269
taking great ideas and collaborations

00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:21,680
will come from this effort I'm sure they

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:24,800
might have already had this morning

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,040
a part of pythons future is sitting in

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,530
this very audience you are all part of

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,610
Python community we are all stakeholders

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:37,820
here so let's talk we want the PSF to be

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,550
impactful so together we need to discuss

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,640
what the PSF does how can we improve it

00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:45,830
new services that we can provide to help

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:50,270
the community so everyone around the

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,500
world can have their own Python story so

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,410
what does that mean what's the call to

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,870
action here in order for the PSF to be

00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:59,810
really connected to the local community

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:02,840
we need to hear from you we need you to

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:05,600
be part of our efforts we need to know

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,060
what support is needed so everyone that

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,430
works so everyone that wants you can

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,310
have their story we need to know what

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,650
the PSF is doing so we can hear feedback

00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:19,040
from you all so we can improve upon the

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,570
work that's needed carry forward the

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,690
positive characteristics of our

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:26,210
community share your stories code

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,540
together ask questions talk to one

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:32,770
another help one another mentor people

00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:35,480
most importantly be kind to one another

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,400
let's put all of our efforts together to

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,600
create a sustainable community our

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:44,000
community together is stronger so I put

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,280
together this this bitly link which

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,380
leads to a Python org page which lists I

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,480
think about 30 different ways anyone can

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,790
get involved with the PSF it's as easy

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,460
as following our blog or signing up for

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,590
our newsletter because just for you to

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,640
know about the PSF is already a huge

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:03,650
step forward for us so now that you've

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,740
heard my story and you've heard the PSF

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,120
story tell me your story don't hesitate

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,950
to come up to me during the conference

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,900
and share how you got involved with

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,790
Python share the characteristics of
