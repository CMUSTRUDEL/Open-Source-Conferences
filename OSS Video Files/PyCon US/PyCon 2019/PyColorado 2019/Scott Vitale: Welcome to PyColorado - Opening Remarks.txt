00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,250
like I mentioned ight I wanted to start

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,200
with kind of the journey the journey of

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,440
Pike Colorado there was there's a lot of

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
effort to get here and I look out at all

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,710
of you and I see a lot of that effort

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,290
right some people walked over from Union

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,379
Station some may have driven down from

00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,850
Boulder some came from further abroad

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,259
they came from all up and down the Front

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,170
Range so we have people from Fort

00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:10,020
Collins from pie-pie Springs from

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,180
Colorado Springs we have people from

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,310
from Pueblo we have people from even

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,979
further the western slope from

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,759
Netherland from Carbondale from all over

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,619
this great state of Colorado and then

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,630
finally we have some people that really

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,460
made really made the journey to Pike

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,440
Colorado they came in from New York they

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,920
came in from Chicago they came in from

00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,570
Ohio some folks from San Francisco

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,200
so we we have this mix of people that

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,520
have all converged here in Colorado for

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:47,310
this very first Pike Colorado conference

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:48,599
yeah yeah yeah I mean that's that's what

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,660
I get really excited about it's like

00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,970
this this is your conference like the

00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,849
the fact that you are all here is what

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,440
makes this such a special event so with

00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,289
that said I want to talk a little bit

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,580
about a different journey the journey of

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,380
you all to get here is really what's

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,690
gonna make it special but there was a

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,280
lot of journey and effort for Frank and

00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,440
I and for our organizing team to get to

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,849
this point so I'd like to go back in

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,860
time a little bit and just kind of talk

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:18,599
through what it took for Pike Colorado

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,970
to come to you and I I promise as to the

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,730
best of my ability no one is gonna die

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:29,700
of dysentery on this on this journey so

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,560
so getting started Frank and I haven't

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,550
known each other all that long I don't

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,260
know if you all have had a chance to

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,260
meet Frank you once you meet him you'll

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,340
never forget him Frank and I met just

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,680
after PyCon 2018 which was held

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,050
oh sorry Frank and I met just after

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,110
PyCon 2017 which was held in Portland

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,760
and we started we were at a boulder

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,040
Python meetup and we started to talk

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,200
about Python and what a great time we

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,640
had and

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,900
of course at PyCon there's a lot of

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,800
promotion of all these regional

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,650
conferences that are happening

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,830
throughout the year and we started

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,920
asking ourselves like why don't we have

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,989
one like Colorado is a pretty cool place

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,160
why why isn't there a regional

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,930
conference here and I mean it's kind of

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,530
hard to beat we've got 300 days of

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,310
sunshine

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:23,330
we've got 58 14,000 foot Peaks to go

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,849
climb Denver alone has over 300 pieces

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,739
of public art there's an interesting

00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:30,230
anecdote about that grab me some other

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,430
time and I'll tell you about it we've

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,680
got a hundred and forty craft breweries

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,780
in Colorado there's there are many many

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,360
reasons why someone would want to come

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,200
and visit so why don't we have a

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,480
regional conference we also have two

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,099
pretty good-sized tech hubs Denver and

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,879
Boulder both have a ton of big companies

00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,709
companies that are either based in even

00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,629
larger market based in San Francisco or

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,220
New York and have opened an office here

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,720
because they want the talent they want

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,420
access to what we have in the front

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,739
range they want the quality of life and

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,420
then there are companies that started up

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,970
here there's a there's a vibrant startup

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,650
community and Founder community and so

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,220
those two tech hubs feel like they

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,290
should be a real draw and furthermore

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,480
they're surrounded by spokes of

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,669
communities that provide even more

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,620
support so although those are the the

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,150
two cities that I called out we have

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,030
cities up and down the Front Range Fort

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,430
Collins has an extraordinary Python

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,210
meetup by Springs has a meet-up that

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,979
happens every two weeks so it's really

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,710
incredible to see a lot of that

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:37,580
enthusiasm all throughout Colorado all

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,919
up and down the Front Range and we we

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,950
have lots of Python users so and this is

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,930
the piece that Frank and I were really

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,220
trying to come to terms with yeah we

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,389
were again we were sitting over beer

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,570
talking about why there wasn't a

00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:53,030
conference here and Frank said well but

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,539
how many are there like really like how

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,770
many Python users are there in Colorado

00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,810
so a bunch nerds

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,690
this is what you get we went crunch some

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,530
data and Frank came up with this

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,750
mind-numbing Venn diagram so

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,830
I hope I hope someone can decipher this

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,090
and explain it to me because I'm not

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,669
entirely sure but what what this really

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,169
told us was so this was a sampling of

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,319
four different communities from the

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:25,039
meetup website one was Denver one was

00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,840
Colorado Springs one was older and then

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,169
one was Front Range Python ears which is

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,639
a like sort of a supergroup if you will

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,810
and so we were trying to understand what

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,419
what was the overlap and how many

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,669
members were in each group and the only

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:41,500
thing that that we could decipher out of

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:43,909
this thing was that there's a lot of

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,060
there's a lot of disparate communities

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:49,129
there's not one dominant community we're

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,659
not all based in Denver and then

00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:53,330
occasionally step out to other places

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,090
right the community is spread throughout

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,650
the state of Colorado and so that that

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,319
was kind of the center it was like okay

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,750
we now we have to put on a regional

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,550
conference because we we want to bring

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,110
all these groups together and this this

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,400
is only a piece of the puzzle right

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,259
there's more groups that we haven't

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,969
accounted for so we said okay how are we

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,310
gonna make this happen like what what

00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:19,219
are we gonna do to actually deliver an

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,479
event that we would be proud of and so

00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:22,219
we're like okay we got to figure out

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
when during the year we're gonna have it

00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:26,569
there's a lot of other conferences to

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,889
compete with venue where where can we

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,020
have it god that seems like it's gonna

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,219
be expensive

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,669
okay sponsor sponsors can help pay for

00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:36,440
that that venue and so the list just

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,180
kept getting longer and longer speakers

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,909
okay now you need to bring people either

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,050
to the conference from other states or

00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,940
you need to bring from your own

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,219
community and you need to mix those

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,529
speakers we want to make sure and

00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:50,659
include diversity and inclusion as has a

00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:53,029
key tenant of our conference we want it

00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,800
to be an accepting place and so this

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,440
list just kept growing and growing and

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,529
growing and we were staring at it like

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,509
oh my god like how is this all gonna

00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:05,870
happen like how can we bring this

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,969
together and so again we pulled out our

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:12,259
engineering hats and flipped them on and

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:15,380
we thought okay it's it's time to make

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:18,380
an MVP like we need to really boil this

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,580
down and to just the basics of what's

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,729
going to make a successful

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,909
grunts and in doing that we enlisted the

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,199
help of other conference organizers I'm

00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:29,270
you're gonna hear me talk a lot about

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,629
community throughout the weekend and

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:36,400
it's true the Python community is unique

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:39,520
there there's an incredible sense of

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,960
fellowship and an incredible sense of

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,189
wanting to help out other people within

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,840
the community and other people that are

00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:47,419
trying to do things across the country

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,770
and so we we leaned really heavily on

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,750
people that have done this before

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,360
there's a ton of regional conferences

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,169
and we literally took something from as

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,789
many as we could it started with the

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,400
code of conduct our code of conduct came

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,319
from PyCon it came from PI Bay we took

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,400
those two and sort of merged them into

00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:09,979
what you'll see on our website today

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,449
we took a COC hotline so I'll talk about

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,039
this a little more in detail later but

00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,840
we have a phone number that you can call

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,520
or text if you need help I need at any

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,860
point during the weekend and that was

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,259
something we lifted from PI Cascades and

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,849
from maryada and Thea Valkyrie who had

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,849
put it together for that conference oh

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,879
I'm a bullet behind I see we pulled in

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,979
these are letters from PI Texas so

00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,930
Dustin Ingraham who I actually don't

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,610
think has arrived yet was kind enough to

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,800
send us a sample visa letter that he

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,490
used to invite someone from a foreign

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:47,630
country to get a US visa all these

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,579
artifacts just turned into enablers

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,769
right these were all the things that

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,730
really allowed us to start checking off

00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,380
the things on that list

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,310
and feel like we could deliver a real

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,230
conference venue and sponsor guidance we

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,970
actually got some help from outside the

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,880
Python community so Dino j/s is a

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,529
conference that happens here in Colorado

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,000
one of our good friends Jess West is one

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,100
of the organizers of that conference and

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,050
she did a phenomenal job of talking us

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,029
through what venue selection looks like

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,130
and how to bring on sponsors and what

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,600
the timing for that looks like there's a

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,980
there's a lot of moving parts and we

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,160
really didn't know any of them to start

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,750
and then finally Emily Freeman who

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,779
you'll actually see just before lunch

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,779
she helped draft our very first sponsor

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,550
prospectus and in a lot of ways that was

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,410
kind of the thing that got us kicked off

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,610
and running because

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,910
now we had something to actually go out

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,680
and talk to people about so it felt very

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,029
much like an open-source project we had

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,410
all these different components that were

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,940
coming in from different people from

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,040
different conferences different guidance

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,769
that we've gotten and ultimately we were

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,199
able to boil it down into the MVP that

00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:56,050
we actually had to work towards so I

00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:57,129
want to talk about what that MVP is I'm

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,959
also going to mention some of the things

00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,029
that we didn't quite get to we we had an

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,670
MVP that we absolutely absolutely wanted

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,079
to achieve we got most of it there's

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,459
some things that kind of fell off the

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,819
bandwagon I want to talk about those as

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,769
well

00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:10,930
so the first thing on the MVP was we

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,689
wanted to have a full day of workshops I

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,920
think that happened there were people

00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:19,389
that go into the workshops yesterday I

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,949
think so so yeah check mark there the

00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,829
educational component was a big piece

00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:25,920
for us Paul and I were just talking just

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:28,870
before the opening remarks about how

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,660
Colorado in general has a large number

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,269
of beginners in Python that comes to the

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,459
meetups and so there's a lot of value in

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,899
encouraging the educational piece of the

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,269
conference it's it's a great way to get

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,470
people introduced to the language

00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,850
although the two talks yesterday were

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,939
not very introductory I'll also throw

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,259
that out so we wanted to have workshops

00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:49,329
that was always in the plan from the

00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,130
beginning we wanted to have two days of

00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:53,560
talks we felt like having a one-day

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,509
conference wasn't quite enough we wanted

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,399
people to really have time to interact

00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,290
with the community and to meet and talk

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:04,630
with the people that they met and to see

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:06,490
them day after day just two days we

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,870
decided to make it single track this was

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,519
actually a really difficult decision so

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,189
we we wanted to make sure that we were

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,259
servicing the data science folks as well

00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,110
as the web folks oh I got ahead of

00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:19,029
myself the data science folks as well as

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,970
the web folks we wanted to make sure

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:24,670
that the talks that we were giving had

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,680
enough interest to really cover most of

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,379
the pike Python ecosystem and most of

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,139
the people that are in our geography and

00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:34,529
so it was really difficult to boil that

00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,819
down into a single track but ultimately

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,500
we wanted to do that to get it done and

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:39,939
I think it's gonna be great I'm really

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,269
excited about the speakers that we've

00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:45,209
got lined up we wanted to really push

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,670
for speaker gender parity that

00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:48,569
something that was on our MVP it was one

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,220
of the important things to us

00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:52,740
unfortunately we didn't quite get there

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,660
we ended up at 1/3 2/3 so we have 1/3

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,519
women and 2/3 men giving the talks

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,119
throughout the weekend that's something

00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,379
that we can improve for next year and I

00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,119
talked about this piece already a little

00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,439
bit we wanted to incorporate all the

00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:07,639
different legs the three legs of the

00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:10,110
stool if you will of Python development

00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,689
finally we wanted to have a venue with

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,369
character so I can't be the final judge

00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,709
of that but I hope that you find a

00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:20,040
studio loft to have some character I

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,420
love that our space is combined but it's

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,610
still separate enough that we can have

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,740
our exhibitors and our breakfast and our

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,059
talks and it's a very cohesive

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,879
environment where you can flow back and

00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:34,290
forth so I hope you enjoy it and finally

00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,959
we wanted it to be affordable not

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:40,319
affordable for us affordable for you we

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,579
wanted anyone in Colorado that wanted to

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,829
come to this conference to be able to

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,199
afford a ticket and so we were able to

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,579
do that with multiple pricing tiers very

00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,079
similar to what PyCon does so we had a

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,459
corporate ticket an individual ticket

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,290
and a student ticket and the student

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,449
ticket was only $50 so we were really

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,879
trying to get as many folks to the

00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:02,420
conference as possible in an affordable

00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,420
way now I have to admit

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,530
we didn't quite get it all right there's

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,660
there's a few things that did not quite

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,480
make the cut and and these are things

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,970
that we absolutely want to bring in a

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,960
future year but I definitely wanted to

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,850
touch on them so one of them was

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,550
Sprint's this I actually just announced

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,710
in slack I think it was a week ago it

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,590
feels like it was a like 10 years ago

00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,090
but Sprint's unfortunately did not come

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,640
together we wanted to have two days of

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,110
Sprint's that were hosted at a venue

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,390
where there was you know some basic

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,040
coffee and refreshments and a place for

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,650
people to work on open-source projects

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,600
and get to know maintainer zuv projects

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,340
and unfortunately we just ran out of

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,830
time and didn't weren't able to make

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,560
that happen but definitely look for

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,650
Sprint's next year we wanted to have a

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,750
family track you know one of the great

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,130
things about a lot of the Python

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,040
conferences is they take place on

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,960
weekends with the purpose of allowing

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,580
people to attend without necessarily

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,580
after having to take time off of work

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,580
which i think is an awesome perspective

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,930
but on the weekend that's also the time

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,180
that most people spend with their family

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,670
and so we had an idea to build a family

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,990
track that would encourage speakers and

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,500
attendees to actually bring their entire

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,150
family to Denver and have a list of

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,120
things to do sort of their their own

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,200
sort of agenda of things that they could

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,030
do around town and things that they

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,250
could engage in Colorado and ways that

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,650
they could enjoy the weekend while their

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,480
spouse or significant other or son or

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,610
whoever it was was here attending the

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,900
conference so didn't quite make it this

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:37,010
year but we will definitely bring that

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:40,040
back a swag lessness initiative so has

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,500
anyone seen Capital Capital One 360 at

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,870
conferences before they do a really

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,000
interesting swag list promotion where

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:50,120
they basically take their entire budget

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,240
that they use for swag and they agree to

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,070
donate it to two charities that are

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,910
active in the city where the conference

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,680
is taking place and the so it's a lot of

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,150
sponsors are like well how do I get how

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,730
do I engage people then like if I don't

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,920
have swag so what they do is they have

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,589
people come and vote for which charity

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,300
they want to give that money to and so

00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,250
it's a way for them to interact with all

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,990
of the people at the conference it's a

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,340
way for them to get those

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,390
connections that they're looking for

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,030
those potential leads that they're

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,680
looking for and it's a way to reduce

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,150
their carbon footprint how much they're

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,040
shipping around how much money they're

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,650
actually spending on stuff that very

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,940
often goes in the trash so no offense to

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,940
any swag that might be out there today

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,460
and then the final thing was

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,230
scholarships and financial aid so we

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,360
really wanted to have a fund set aside

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,330
to help people who couldn't even afford

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,680
the $50 ticket or we're coming from a

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,110
long distance and could use some

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,440
assistance in terms of their travel and

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,030
lodging and ultimately this is still

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,130
something that we're gonna chase I think

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,510
doing this as a first year conference is

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,960
challenging because the dollars and

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,540
cents are really unknown when you first

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,740
start out and so I'm really looking

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,360
forward to implementing this next year

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,860
as a way to bring some people from far

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,600
away places and then finally we we want

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,220
a few perks so we kind of talked about

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,490
the MVP we talked about the things that

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,430
that didn't quite make the cut or died

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,320
of dysentery and then we also got a few

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,620
things that are kind of nice to haves

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,580
that we're excited about I'm excited

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,220
because we have all-day coffee and tea

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,320
all right yeah I've had like 10 cups

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,270
this morning so we're really like we're

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,890
good to go

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,420
so I you know I think that was something

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,590
although it's a small thing I think it's

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,270
something that people really appreciate

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,830
and that's ultimately what we wanted to

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,090
do for you

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,180
the second thing on this list is

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,160
Microsoft's DNI lunch so Emily Freeman

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,640
will actually get up on stage here at

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,170
12:10 and talk about what what their DNI

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,840
lunch is all about and what its gonna

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,930
look like ultimately Microsoft came in

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,730
within the last week and said we want to

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,700
be involved we want to be part of pie

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,490
Colorado we want to help provide a DNI

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,720
lunch the first day and so we are super

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,700
excited to have them as a partner for

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,140
this and it's something that we did not

00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,540
expect to be able to pull off in a week

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,000
and and it actually got done so we're

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,530
very excited about that and then finally

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,480
the +1 tickets I don't know if anyone

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,459
noticed the +1 tickets well some people

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,830
notice because they bought them but we

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,900
had +1 tickets listed on the PI Colorado

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:27,140
site and the concept there was that you

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,640
would buy a ticket and in buying that

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,700
ticket you would get a second ticket

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,440
that you could give to someone that

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,659
couldn't afford to come otherwise and so

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,700
ultimately we ended up with five plus

00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:40,610
one tickets and those five plus one

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:44,120
tickets got given to Python students at

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:47,210
dev 'try which is a school here in in

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,830
Denver that's teaching intro to Python

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:56,269

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:58,250

thank you for coming now I want to get

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,289

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,789
the schedule we have sixteen speakers

00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,649
over the course of the next two days

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:20,059
there was one updates that the schedule

00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,950

only schedule adjustment the other thing

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,519
I'll add is that our schedule is only on

00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,100
the website we don't have any printed

00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,590
programs but it's super mobile mobile

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,320
friendly and easy to use so you know

followed by a ten minute break so

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:52,460
there'll be ten minutes where the

00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:57,649
speakers are changing over and then the

00:18:52,460 --> 00:19:00,710

00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:03,470
QA QA today is going to be at the

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,700
speaker's discretion so if there's time

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,590
at the end of their talk and they would

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,779
like to take questions we're gonna have

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,940
a handheld mic that we put in the center

00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,429
aisle and so you're welcome to come up

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,380
to that microphone and ask questions the

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,330
one thing I will say is when you get in

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,179
front of that microphone and you're

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,779
ready to say something please remember

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:25,990
to phrase your question in the form of a

00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,990
question

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,440
[Applause]

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,420
and credit for that goes entirely to

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,600
Brandon Rhodes I I could not come up

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,270
with that phrasing myself I already

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,770
talked about the Microsoft diversity

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,840
inclusion lunch that's happening today

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,210
as I said Emily Freeman will kick that

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,770
off on stage here at 12:10 so make sure

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,160
to be in the audience before we head out

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,630
and then we're gonna wrap up at 5:40

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,460
p.m. this is both days so we'll wrap up

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:59,760
today at 5:40 p.m. and we'll wrap up

00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:01,410
tomorrow at 5:40 p.m. geography so I

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,300
want to bring your attention to the

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,980
hallway over here the end of that

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,450
hallway we have a mother's room so if we

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,160
have any nursing mothers please feel

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,710
free to take advantage of that there's a

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,150
comfy chair and a table in there and

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,850
then we also have a refrigerator where

00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,220
we can store milk so please take

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,390
advantage of that if you need it

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,940
bathrooms if you haven't already found

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,650
them are out this way and down the

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,390
hallway so if you go out and pass the

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,520
elevator where you came in and head down

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:29,760
the hall we have both gendered and on

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,430
gendered bathrooms over there if you

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,100
continue down that hallway you'll find

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:39,090
yourself in the loge that's a fancy way

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:42,210
to say a big for full of tables and so

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,740
in the loge it's really a place for you

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,910
if you need to take a break or you need

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,100
to plug in your laptop you need to

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,890
answer some emails we've got a few power

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,740
strip set up there so feel free to take

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:55,530
a break and head over there and sit down

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,920
and then come on back for the talks of

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,570
course and then the speakers lounge so

00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,950
four speakers if we haven't already

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,100
talked about it there is a dedicated

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,780
speakers lounge that's down one floor if

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,290
you have any questions about how to get

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,810
there

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:14,670
just grab Frank or myself or any staff

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:16,470
member and then I wanted to talk about

00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,700
some of the community pieces I warned

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,690
you I warned you I was gonna use this

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,730
word a lot so I I want to talk about how

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,950
to make this a really successful weekend

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,770
for all of us so the first thing is

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,530
please silence your cell phones it's not

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,210
a huge deal but it's always nicer as a

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,960
speaker to not to not be distracted by

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,210
that so please I talked about the code

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,290
of conduct hotline earlier this is the

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,000
phone number

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,350
the phone number is also on a couple of

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,299
these stand signs I don't know if it's

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,669
on I don't think it's on this one it's

00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,290
not one of the other ones if you need

00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:52,620
help at any point throughout the weekend

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,750
call this number or send a text and this

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,880
will actually ring a few of our code of

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,919
conduct staff members who will answer

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,400
the phone find out what's wrong and help

00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,840
you you can also send texts like I said

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,790
the code of conduct staff member that's

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,380
on duty is actually gonna be wearing a

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:16,860
Ranger hat like a right there that's a

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:19,650
Ranger head questions our feedback on

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,360
slack so Frank and I are basically

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,520
checked out of email at the current

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,470
point so if you need something that's

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,290
not urgent that's not Kodokan heard not

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,429
hotline worthy you know please reach out

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,730
on slack and we'll try to answer those

00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:34,410
questions as quickly as we can I also

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,210
wanted to talk about the pack mineral so

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,190
this was brought up in the slack Channel

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,740
and I was really glad to hear it

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,360
Eric culture who was the founder one of

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,309
the founders of read the docs and write

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,419
the docs came up with this rule a number

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,400
of years ago and I think it's a great

00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,470
mentality to take into a conference like

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,960
this so the idea is if you imagine

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,000
pacman I should put a pacman logo on the

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,210
slide if you imagine pac-man with his

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,290
open mouth picture that as your group of

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,780
people that you're standing around

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,980
talking to so we all tend to stand in

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,600
circles when we talk when we're having a

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,880
conversation and those circles tend to

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,340
be closed circles once you recognize

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,040
that and you see it if you can take the

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,320
opportunity to step to one side and open

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,850
a space that really opens the

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,740
opportunity for someone to come in and

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,330
join that conversation and engage in

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,850
whatever discussion you're having so I

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,600
encourage you to recognize and follow

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,400
the pac-man rule where you can finally

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,000
on community I want to talk about the

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,030
food topic in slack so another way that

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,400
we want to help people interact and meet

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,900
new folks is to make sure that they have

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,549
someone to eat with whether it's at

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,309
lunch or it's a dinner or it's after

00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:44,100
hours and so there's a food channel in

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,350
slack and the purpose there is really

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,230
kind of open form but it's a way for you

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,340
to post where you're going if you if you

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,260
want to bring some people along with you

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,460
or if you're looking for somewhere to go

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,500
for dinner

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,970
you know post in there as well it's just

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,130
a way that we can all kind of coordinate

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:03,960
and try to find places for everyone to

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:06,960
to eat and then my final note is on

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,030
social media so there's two pieces I

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,039
want to tell you about we have a Google

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,460
photo share which is photos dat pie

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,260
Colorado org the photos that are in this

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,940
album may be used for social media so

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,049
that's worth keeping in mind and the

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,700
other thing I want to point out is that

00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,919
there are some folks wearing red

00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,470
lanyards around the room and so the red

00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,700
lanyard means stop it means those folks

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,409
would prefer not to have their photo

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,570
taken and so please don't photograph

00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,130
anyone with a red lanyard and please

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,909
please don't upload any of those photos

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:40,289
to the to the photo duck finally on

00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:42,570
social media we are by Colorado and we

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,299
to thank the PSF so the Python Software

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,479
Foundation is the organizing force

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,509
behind Pike on us they are also an

00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:28,279
organizing force behind a number of

00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:31,099
other initiatives very focused on

00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,869
education they provided a grant for Pike

00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:34,759
Colorado based on the program that we

00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:36,559
put together with the talks with the

00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,789
educational component and so we

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,830
ultimately we couldn't have done this

00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:41,029
without their help and support so a big

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:47,210
