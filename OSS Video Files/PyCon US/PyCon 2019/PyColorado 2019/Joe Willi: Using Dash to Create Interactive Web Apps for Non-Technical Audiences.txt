[Music]

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,800
just quick thanks to all of you for

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,960
coming out and thanks to all the

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,540
conference organizers and everyone else

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,120
who helped make this event possible so

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,640
today I'll be talking about how I use -

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,800
to create an interactive application for

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,839
a firefighter to collect sensor data

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,180
while he was testing one of their pieces

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:04,470
of equipment and then towards the end of

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,970
the talk I'll talk about some key

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,070
takeaways that I've had throughout the

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,770
project so far they can be applied to

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,210
creating these kinds of apps

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,210
specifically for non-technical audiences

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,009
it's a little bit about myself I'm a

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,899
research engineer with underwriters

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,539
laboratories and so for those II who

00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,009
aren't familiar with ul we do a lot of

00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:28,830
things but for the most part we're a

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,020
safety certification company so we do a

00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,960
lot of consumer products testings so if

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,420
you look from on everything from smoke

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,220
alarms to your computer chargers to the

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,420
exit doors in this building if you look

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,580
close enough chances are you'll find

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,039
that ul logo on there we ul is a pretty

00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,050
big company we have over 14,000

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,649
employees in nearly 50 countries around

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,380
the world

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,800
and working for them has just been

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,240
really great they have a very strong

00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,259
company culture that's mission oriented

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,729
towards creating a safer world and the

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,970
higher-ups have been very supportive of

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,700
the work that my group does and so I'm

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,380
very grateful for that and so there's

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,110
two sides to ul there's a for-profit

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,640
side and a non-for-profit side the group

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,470
I'm with is on the non for-profit side

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,780
and we're the firefighter safety

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,569
Research Institute we're based out of

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,640
Columbia Maryland and our main goal is

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,200
to conduct research that's focused on

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,780
advancing the knowledge of fire behavior

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,250
throughout the fire service and as our

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,230
group continues to grow and expand

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,599
throughout fields that are adjacent to

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:39,140
the fire service so my job along with

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,150
other engineers in the group is

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,280
essentially the light things on fire

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,739
it's pretty fun and then study and

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,750
measure what happens analyze the results

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,750
and share the results with our

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,670
stakeholders we're essentially a group

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,390
of pyromaniacs who've channeled our

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,860
urges towards the greater good

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,140
and I feel like now it's a good time to

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,670
just mention that I had nothing to do

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,730
with the fire alarm activation last

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,680
night at the hotel for those of you were

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:13,349
staying there I'd say I thought I'd

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,500
share this quick 30 second video from

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,269
experiments that we conducted this past

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,670
July in Cobb County just outside of

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,920
Atlanta Georgia it was made by our

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,569
extremely talented content developer and

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,530
it'll kind of give you a better idea of

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,210
what it's like when we're out in the

00:03:25,530 --> 00:04:06,569
field burning things

00:03:27,210 --> 00:04:06,569
[Music]

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,030
so as far as the programming experience

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,040
of what I would consider a casual

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,530
programming background and by that I

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,239
mean as a when I was an undergrad I took

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,770
some courses where I had to learn C and

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,210
C++ and LabVIEW MATLAB etc but by far

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,310
the language that I use the most and

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,880
that our group uses the most is Python

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,610
and as far as the level of Python user I

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,750
guess I'm at the intermediate level

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,530
basically I know enough to know there's

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,760
still a whole bunch of Python topics

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:45,560
especially in terms of optimization and

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,030
best practices that I can learn the

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,960
libraries that I use most and that our

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,540
group uses most include numpy pandas

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,080
matplotlib and we generally use Python

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,250
for data analysis post-processing and

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,190
generating plots like the one you see

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,010
here for reports of pretty simple plots

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,169
but any time an opportunity comes along

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:09,110
for me to learn something new especially

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:12,260
with Python at work I tend to jump on

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,880
the opportunity for example just

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,789
finishing up a project where I use

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,280
tensorflow and OpenCV to extract flame

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:21,470
height data from experimental video and

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,260
then we're able to compare that flame

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,150
height data to predictive models and

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,500
algorithms that fire investigators use

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,630
when they're trying to recreate a fire

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,639
and so this desire of mine to always

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,320
always looking for something new to

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,970
learn in Python as part of the way I got

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,100
involved with this project so I'll start

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,039
today with some background in motivation

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,620
about the project and then I'll give a

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,960
brief overview of exactly what - is and

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,590
show some examples to give you a better

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,360
idea of its capabilities then I'll

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,979
discuss the dashboard that I created

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:05,990
which is called the azv dashboard and

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:07,820
I'll give you a quick overview of the

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,099
dashboard from its beginning to its

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:14,210
current version now and lastly I'll

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:16,010
finish with some key takeaways so I

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,810
became involved with this project

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,780
through my work

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,220
ul one day one of my co-workers pulled

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,600
me in his office and he started telling

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,880
me about this firefighter named Kelly

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,460
who was on a rescue squad in Washington

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,540
DC and just a quick aside for those of

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,389
you who aren't up to date on your

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,400
firefighter lingo rescue squad is a

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,290
group of firefighters who are not only

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,810
proficient and firefighting seals but

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,000
also technical rescue skills so they

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,550
respond to all kinds of events that

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,040
involve the need of their skills for

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,840
example if somebody flips their car on

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,010
the highway and becomes entrapped or

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,590
if someone falls off an embankment more

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,810
likely than not some of the first

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,810
firefighters to respond will be from a

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,970
rescue squad

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,800
so anyway Keith my coworker was telling

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,260
me about this guy named Kelly and he had

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,690
this tool he's been looking at known as

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,850
the Arizona vortex or a CV for short

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,360
it's basically this tripod looking thing

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:18,470
here and it's designed to keep ropes off

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:22,360
the ground to protect them when workers

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:24,320
are performing rescue operations and

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,200
essentially they mount pulleys to the

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,030
top here and that run ropes through and

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,350
put them in tension and then perform

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,539
whatever rescue operations they're

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,450
working on and it's very important to

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,890
know the distributions of the forces on

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,229
this device because if it's not used

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,260
properly it could topple over obviously

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,840
that's not good one of the things that

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,430
makes this device unique is that not

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,560
only can it be used with three legs but

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,630
there's configurations that can be used

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,220
with two legs or there's even one with

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:57,500
where it's just the pole so as this

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,389
device has gained popularity over the

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,160
years people have been wondering all

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,510
sorts of things about it like what are

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,229
the magnitudes of the forces on the

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,960
different legs

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,120
how do those forces vary between the

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,440
different configurations and how close

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,450
do they come when they're using it to

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,430
the rated limits of the device and so as

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,930
people do trial and error and start

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,860
messing with the tool to start making

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,330
claims and Kelly kind of wanted to see

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,010
how valid these claims were and have

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:30,289
have actual data to back them up and so

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,330
having no real background in electronics

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,760
or data act was

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,669
Kelly took the initiative and did

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,089
research and bought some load cells in a

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:42,370
data acquisition device and eventually

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:45,850
was able to rig up at the load cells to

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,910
each leg and get some data but a lot of

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,260
times in research you get the initial

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,339
data and then that just causes more

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,860
questions and so he won't he asked Keith

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,930
my co-worker if he knew of anyone who'd

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,180
be interested in kind of taking this

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,589
project to the next level there were a

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,110
couple things he wanted to do with it

00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,480
and so Keith reshot to me and I

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,760
immediately jumped on the opportunity

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:14,950
thinking it would be a great opportunity

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,990
opportunity to learn how to use - so by

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:24,370
a quick show of hands who here has heard

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:25,959
of plotly - all right cool for those of

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,410
you who haven't it's a library from

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,459
plotly for creating analytical

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,800
applications it's written on top of

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:37,390
flask flatly Jass and react yes and the

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,290
real power of it is that you can create

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,600
these applications solely through Python

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,420
and so I have a quick example pulled up

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,630
from the - app gallery that I can show

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:57,610
all of you to give you a better idea of

00:09:48,630 --> 00:10:00,130
what this tool is capable of so just

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,449
real quickly this is the - get app

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,730
calories there's about 45 different

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:08,709
applications that are all for different

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:18,600
purposes from data analysis to financial

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:18,600
report creation and Bosma cursor

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,969
this is an example that I have pulled up

00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,229
you can see there's all sorts of

00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:31,189
interactive components

00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:34,529
there's sliders there's dropdowns and

00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:38,029
depending on what you choose the data

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:43,799
responds accordingly the plots update

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:47,819
there's you can do maps and have hover

00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:50,089
capabilities but again this plot here

00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:54,539
responds to it these are all plotly

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,679
graphs so they're fully interactive and

00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,439
so if you just take a second to think

00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:02,279
about what would be needed to to create

00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:06,359
something like this if you were to

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,189
create something just without using any

00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:10,229
sort of tools like - you would need to

00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:13,019
know JavaScript probably have to know

00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:15,929
some CSS to make it look nice you have

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:19,019
to write your own server probably need

00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:22,469
react and a bunch of other things that

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,049
I'm not familiar with so this is this is

00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:28,519
really the power of the tools that you

00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,519
can create this all through Python

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,410
and also the as I'll show in a second

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,120
with the simple example that I made the

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:45,620
structure of the code is very

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,620
straightforward and simple and so now

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,880
move on to the dashboard I created so

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,870
after I heard about this project I

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,660
decided the first step should probably

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,510
be to at least look at - and start start

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,010
learning it and the I found that the

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,320
user guide was a great place to start

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,090
they have some very simple examples and

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:11,750
that they go over the structure of the

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:14,060
code and so I also received a few data

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,270
files from Kelly and I figured I would

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,100
make a very simple application for our

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,010
first meeting just to kind of show them

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,740
what what the tools capable of and so

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:28,070
I'll show you one of those applications

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,080
that I made just to give you an example

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:34,640
and go over the code structure very

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:38,890
quickly so this is the application I

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,890
made it's very simple you just select I

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:49,880
lost my cursor again you select a data

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,640
file from the drop-down menu and then it

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:59,410
creates graphs of the voltage and then

00:12:52,640 --> 00:13:05,650
the load data from the data file and so

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,650
this is the code that creates the SAP

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,880
import all your packages this is

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,650
basically just grabbing the data file

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,830
names from the directory and then this

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:21,860
initializes your app and there's really

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:24,590
two parts to - code there's the first

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,140
part here that defines all your

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,400
components so if you look over here

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,830
there's really three components there's

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,010
a title just defined by this line then

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:38,450
there's the drop-down and lastly there's

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:41,840
your output graph and the second part of

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,820
the of - code is how the defined

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,480
components up here interact with one

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,950
another so

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:55,500
they have callback functions and the

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,180
second entry is the component and the

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,340
part of the component that will trigger

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,110
this callback function so here it's the

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,100
the value of the drop down when that

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,580
changes this function below will run and

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:13,940
then the first input is what's going to

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:17,070
be updated as a result of of this

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,520
function below and so in this case it's

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:25,560
going to update the children of this

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:28,560
output graph object so basically this

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:33,470
function just reads in the data file and

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,270
then it returns two graphs and so these

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,940
DCC is - core components they have a

00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,800
whole bunch of different components that

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,440
you can use so that you have like graphs

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,800
and buttons and indicator lights all

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,200
sorts of things that you're able to

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,500
implement into the application that

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,500
you're building

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,460
so after I created those a couple

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,990
examples I met with Kelly and he

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,780
introduced me to the project and showed

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,670
me the progress so far and then we kind

00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,620
of discussed where we wanted the project

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,200
to go what the goals and purpose of the

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,850
project were a demo those examples for

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,000
him and kind of described different

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:29,510
capabilities offered by - and we

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,730
brainstormed kind of what the next

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,250
direction or the next things we wanted

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:38,690
to implement and we developed a list of

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:40,250
initial objectives and so the initial

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,350
directives we came up with was basically

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,770
we wanted this to be able to read in a

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,950
data file and then output the sensor

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:52,340
values in real time and generate plots

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:55,070
after the test was completed and the

00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:59,000
interface should be straightforward and

00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:02,240
easy to use so the first version that I

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,220
I created was focused on functionality

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,840
and keeping things simple and this

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,210
proved challenging times because the

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,490
more I used - the more I loved it the

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,900
more ideas flowed in but instead of

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,430
falling down the rabbit hole of trying

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,140
to implement the ideas immediately I

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,600
just scribbled them down on a piece of

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,800
paper took notes and - have been tried

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,780
them at a later date so then once I had

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,880
a version that was up and running and

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,640
filling the objectives I met with Kelly

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,670
again and we demoed it and more ideas

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,790
floated and he told me what was good

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,680
what what could be removed and we

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:42,650
prioritized more goals for the next

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:45,560
version and so this latest version has a

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,660
number of improvements to it first of

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,640
all I had decided it would be a good

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,040
milestone to kind of take the time to

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:57,020
clean up and improve the code just be

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,390
easier as I add things and then I also

00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,930
enhanced the styling and aesthetics a

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,720
little bit

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,480
I changed the layout of the page from

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,480
the table layout to flexbox I was able

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,550
to scale down the fonts so they could so

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,380
they would change size with changing

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:16,410
window size they created a CSS file that

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,920
organized all all the diff

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:23,610
styling components and I added some

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,990
logos at the top and improved the graph

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:31,490
in plot style and I added some animation

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:35,000
to buttons for when you hover over them

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:39,420
and then I also added a couple features

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,630
event logging and display of values so

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,220
when it's logging real time it's the

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:47,070
real time value and then and the

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,830
post-test drop down it's the maximum

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:53,100
value that displays just to give you an

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,810
idea better idea of what the first

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,340
version looked like compared to the

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,470
second version this is the first version

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,350
you can see it as kind of the

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,690
functionalities we talked about this is

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,950
the post at the post test plot so it's

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,510
just essentially another version of the

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,760
simple example I showed earlier where

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,190
there's a drop down and then plot

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,610
appears you can see I mean it gets the

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,620
job done but the lines on the plot are

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:23,210
pretty thin this font is kind of small

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:27,780
this drop-down is unnecessarily wide and

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:31,680
so this is the latest version the same

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,650
tab and you can see we now output the

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,170
maximum values the lines are thicker the

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:42,810
fonts a little larger and there's pretty

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:46,440
logos up here at the top so now I'll

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:48,830
show a quick demo of the dashboard in

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,830
action

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,250
so there's a number of things that the

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,930
user needs to input on the setup tab

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,210
there's a channel list of all the

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:22,370
possible channels on the the DAC device

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:25,380
and then when the user selects them the

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:32,730
field under this populates and you can

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:34,970
enter custom names so I'll just enter so

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,970
on

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:54,080
then there's a list of additional inputs

00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:58,640
including the data type in case he

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,040
starts using sensors in addition to load

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,530
cells the units that you're outputting

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,930
your data and the frequency of the data

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,840
collection how long you want your

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,800
background time to be I will just do

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,080
like five seconds

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,830
so that's eros the load cells before it

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:23,990
starts collection and then the output

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:26,990
file name and then once all this all the

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,710
fields are populated a user can go ahead

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,600
and hit start data collection and it

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:40,100
creates an info file that has all these

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:42,140
inputs then we can switch to the real

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,850
time tab and that has the plot in real

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:48,290
time you can see the values are being

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:55,220
displayed in real time the event logging

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:58,940
that I had is this button here so you

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:03,920
can type in an event and then hit the

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:06,830
event and you can see the load cell

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,590
response pushing on it now and it's in

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,860
compression and if I pull its intention

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:20,660
so that's positive and same thing with

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:23,300
load cell number two and then once

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:28,010
you're done doing whatever you do it

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:30,050
with with the azv you can hit end data

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,670
collection and it stops the collection

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:37,640
and then you can go over here the

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:40,370
post-test tab just like your file and

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,670
look at the plots and again these are

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:45,920
all fully interactive plotly graph so if

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:50,480
you want to you can download it as a PNG

00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:53,770
you can zoom in on certain values and do

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,770
a number of other things

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:04,770
it says some upcoming improvements that

00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,750
we're looking at incorporating and

00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:10,270
number one would be a button that zeros

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,770
the sensors during the test and this is

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,470
because after talking to Kelly he's

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,440
saying that they'll get the device set

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,120
up and then they'll get the ropes run

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,340
through and then they tension the ropes

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,590
and they'd like to zero it then so they

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,000
can see what what fraction of the forces

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,980
due to the tensioning of the ropes and

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,870
then what fracture the forces due to its

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:34,450
actual usage another improvement that's

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:38,110
in the works as a sensor calibration tab

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,910
so essentially get the calibration

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,290
constants for the load cells by applying

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,700
different weights to them and then add

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:48,100
indicator lights and a time ticker to

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,390
let you know when you're in real time

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,640
plot mode and it's about the dashboards

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,890
about at a point where I'm comfortable

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,420
giving it to Kelly to for him and his

00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,980
firefighter friends to use I'm sure

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,430
they'll find a bunch of bugs that need

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,680
to be resolved and then eventually we

00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,360
want to add the capability for wireless

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,130
data logging I'm thinking about using

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,780
probably an Arduino to do this now I

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,780
like to briefly go over some key

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,450
takeaways that I've had from this

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,220
project it's one thing I found that was

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,310
very helpful is developing clear

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,410
objectives from the start you need to

00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,960
figure out what your audience once it's

00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,930
very important to remember that a lot of

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,410
cases your audience main your audience

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:37,800
doesn't know what they don't know so if

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:43,980
you can help them out by providing

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:48,520
details of what the tools possible of

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:50,950
that's a good way to get them to come up

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,510
with ideas and and see things that might

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:57,700
give them ideas things to implement so

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,580
some good resources for that is the dash

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,120
app gallery that I showed and also just

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,130
trying to create a couple examples by

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,000
yourself so you become familiar with the

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,580
the product

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,430
and just start simple to hit the ground

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:18,190
running try not to go down rabbit holes

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,190
of implementing complicated ideas or

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,510
things you're not familiar with until

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,300
you have a better grasp on on a product

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,160
that actually works and be sure not to

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,220
over promise but at least not too much

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,840
you know some people liked over proper

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,700
just have the habit of over-promising

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,040
because it motivates them myself

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,870
included but it's just important that if

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,540
you do and things aren't going the way

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,490
you want them to that you keep in

00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,860
continuous contact with whoever your end

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:49,460
users and to communicate receive

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,990
feedback from them often it's also

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,660
important that you take clear notes

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,550
throughout whether it be chicken scratch

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,820
like in the moment and then you go back

00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:01,400
and organize it and neater writing that

00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:05,150
you can actually read you should take

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:09,170
notes from ideas you have when you're

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,760
demoing for the end user and as you

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:15,070
develop code anything that comes to mind

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,750
and anytime you create something that

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,940
that works but you know that it could be

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,970
drastically improved be sure to make a

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,190
note of that and then as you're going

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,840
about make sure you rank them in order

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,600
of implementation so you can start with

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,380
the low-hanging fruit and then work your

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,730
way up it's important that throughout

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,670
the development you revisit your

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:41,090
objectives specifically when you demo it

00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:43,610
and revisit the objectives with your end

00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:46,490
user just make sure you're on the same

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:51,050
page and that your ideas sync up with

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,790
his or hers and then be sure to take

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,570
time to clean your code when you reach

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,180
certain milestones because otherwise I'm

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,740
sure you're all familiar with you'll end

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,490
up going through thousands of lines of

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,200
code you have no idea what's going on

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,420
and the most important thing is to just

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,310
treat it as a learning experience

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,950
especially if you're unfamiliar not

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,420
really that familiar with - there's a

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,450
bunch of great resources out there to

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,860
help help you get started the user guide

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,550
like I said it's a good place to start

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,740
the - app gallery that's all

00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,920
the - app gallery is something good you

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,860
can share with your end user to get them

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,210
thinking about ideas and then also

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,640
there's a whole bunch of online

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,300
tutorials on YouTube and Python

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,940
programming net has a really good five

00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,130
part series I believe that kind of helps

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:48,160
you go go through creating your first

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:49,720
application and with that real quick

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,490
note if you want to spice up your

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,040
Twitter feed be sure to follow our group

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,020
button on Twitter the handle right there

00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,140
you'll get some cool fire pictures and

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:07,570
you'll get updates about the work we do

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:09,580
and that's about it because you were

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,370
reading in Python most of the time or

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,010
all of the time and it was sort of

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,200
writing JavaScript and also react for

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,760
you were there times when you felt that

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,320
you were fighting you had to fight the

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,080
code that it was generating for you

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:32,080
whether it be the CSS or the JavaScript

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,600
no but I don't know if it's a I would

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,270
like to think that it's a product of of

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,940
- itself but it could also just be a

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:46,060
product by ignorance of those other

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:48,430
tools but I guess you know there are a

00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:52,840
couple times I was kind of learning to

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:55,480
make the CSS file that things would be

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,570
different from the Python code itself to

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,900
be styling but there was never any time

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:07,960
where I really struggled with that I

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:10,240
guess hi thanks for introducing this -

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,610
app because it is great for someone like

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,600
me who has a phobia for node.js and

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:19,330
JavaScript and all web app kind of stuff

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,210
and I see it as a lot of useful for my

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,580
projects but my question is are you or

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,860
have you ever heard anyone using the -

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:33,720
on a server less compute platform such

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:33,720
as AWS lambda I can't say that I have

00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:40,380
and I'm not sure I would think that's

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:44,200
possible okay thank you yeah

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,090
is it possible to embed a - app with an

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:52,179
existing website or does it have to run

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:54,730
standalone as far as I know I believe it

00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:56,399
has to run standalone but I mean that

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,639
doesn't mean that you can't I just

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,320
haven't come across something that

00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:05,610
explicitly says that you can't or seen

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:12,340
an example thanks agree on the time I

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:15,549
was wondering about the use of the the -

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,559
app in real time during like in the

00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,690
field for these firefighters you guys

00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,299
just use these in test environments or

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,370
are you taking them or when once you

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,529
implement this wireless communication

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,049
for these sensors would you take them in

00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:32,529
the field and see in practice how that

00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,940
performs let's get questions so that's

00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:35,799
another part of the reason that I

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,809
started wanting to learn to use dashes

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,570
eventually incorporate into the field

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:43,090
testing that we do and all that

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,500
basically do live visualizations of the

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,100
data that we collect when we're out in

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,789
the field so yes that's a plan down the

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:54,129
road is and I'm pretty excited to see

00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,460
the limitations I've - because we

00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:58,870
collects like over 200 channels of data

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,580
at times when we're out in the field

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,279
during those tests so it'll be

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,679
interesting to see and a good way for me

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,360
to learn about optimization of code as

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,090
well because sure that'll have a lot to

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,960
do with pushing its limits are there any

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:15,700
other sensors or any kind of hardware

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,909
they you have plans for in the future or

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,799
that you already are using that add you

00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:23,470
know something like a dashboard like -

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,860
can provide can you know apply as well

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,330
to monitor other types of faulty you

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,210
know hardware that you might that the

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,289
firefighters might encounter or use

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,299
that's definitely a possibility for the

00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:38,409
future here there's no no plans on the

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:40,149
books job you and I think that's I think

00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,279
we need to stop so if you want to come

00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:44,940
find me afterwards be more than happy to

00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,940
answer your question

00:30:45,890 --> 00:31:03,900
[Applause]
