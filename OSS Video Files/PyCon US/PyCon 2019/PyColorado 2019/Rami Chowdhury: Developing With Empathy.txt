Description: 
	Building software is a team sport, we’re told. Yet it’s cooperation that makes teams work, and without empathy we can’t cooperate. This talk looks at adding care to our code and raising the bar beyond "just come talk to me if you have a problem".

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,610
so good morning everyone my name is Rami

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,710
and I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,210
developing with empathy a little bit

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,070
about myself I'm currently a principal

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,260
engineer at a start-up in Washington DC

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,670
called website travel and you can

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,420
generally find me on the Internet as

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,220
nekaris

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,930
so you know being a developer as many of

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,030
us are I like to start with definitions

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,580
you know start with understanding the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,440
situation figuring out what the problems

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,840
are and then coming up with solutions

00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,190
and evaluating them and I'm aware that

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,140
what I'm talking about right now might

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,750
seem like a solution but I assure you

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,920
maybe you don't have this problem yet

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,240
maybe you've had it in the past but you

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,130
don't right now but I'd be very

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,720
surprised if you don't run into some of

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,140
these problems and I'd love to talk to

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
you about that so let's begin at the

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,130
beginning with an overview of the

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,020
situation I'm gonna steal a few words

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,420
from my fellow Washingtonians mr. Marvin

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,250
Gaye and hope that you can keep his

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,929
smooth tones in the back of your minds

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,800
for the rest of this talk because he

00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,069
sounds better than I do so in my years

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,420
in tech I've heard plenty of complaints

00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:50,640
but there are a few themes that keep

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,860
recurring and I'm gonna just say a few

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,179
things that I've noticed and hope that

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,810
some of these statements resonate with

00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,660
you as well

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,590
I look around myself at work and I see

00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,300
mostly men I'm consumed with dread every

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,770
time I'm introduced to a new Legacy

00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,399
codebase that I have to add features to

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,509
I have junior colleagues at work who

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,380
struggle to feel like they can

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:15,450
contribute at all I personally know more

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,970
than one open-source maintainer who has

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,690
burned out completely from contributing

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,610
and I recently read that over 60 percent

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,230
of the people

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,239
sixty percent of developers I should say

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,700
from an underrepresented group in

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,319
technology left their last job because

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,050
of their work environment and the people

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,430
that were surrounded by that's that's a

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,440
lot so I'm not saying that the solution

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,290
to all of these problems is a little bit

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,660
of empathy not by a longshot but it does

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,090
make us better colleagues better open

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,090
source contributors and I like to think

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,379
better people in general so I'm saying

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,650
we need to bring some of this to our

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:58,000
work as develop

00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,220
I found that different people think of

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,980
different things when I say this words

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,540
I'm gonna go ahead and define it

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,150
according to the dictionary empathy is

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,060
being sensitive to and in tune with

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,049
others thoughts and feelings and

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,150
according to some pop psychology

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:17,200
articles that I've read we can break it

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,970
down into three types personal distress

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,500
is literally feeling another person's

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,940
emotions it's like when you're watching

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,810
a horror movie and you see them going to

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,500
the creepy house and you're thinking

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,500
don't go in there

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,209
empathic concern is a little more what

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,400
most of us think of when we hear about

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,900
empathy it's recognizing another's

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,859
emotional feelings that you know being

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,629
in tune with them and of course there's

00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,970
also a purely cognitive purely logical

00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,260
way to practice empathy which is where

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,420
you understand where someone else is

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,959
coming from and from that you can infer

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,879
their priorities and their concerns so

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,129
one last point of definition or maybe a

00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,629
little reminder we've all heard about

00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,879
this Golden Rule which is cited in

00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:58,900
various places and practicing empathy is

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,209
actually a little bit different from

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,220
that because rather than focusing on

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,290
what would meet our needs and projecting

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:12,190
outwards we try and focus on what meets

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:14,500
those of others now I understand people

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,570
are hard and that's one of the reasons I

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,000
became a developer as a career and it

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,070
may be true for some of you as well but

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,260
I want to remind everyone that it's not

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,750
an innate attribute this is a skill we

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,550
can all practice and it can actually

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,229
make people easier to grasp and work

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,880
with

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:33,490
not to mention like we just saw there's

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,659
a purely cognitive empathic form that

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,580
even mr. Spock could get on board with

00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:41,889
now an aside I learned from the

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,650
excellent book bro topia by Emily Chan

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,389
which ever should read that a lot of

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,909
tests that were developed for program

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,610
aptitude from the 1960s through to the

00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:54,010
1980s featured this entirely speculative

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,849
component about antisocial behavior

00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,280
being a good trait for programmers I

00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:02,440
know right and that mental image has

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,360
definitely influenced many of us myself

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,020
included write about what it means to be

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,300
a good developer

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,730
and I want to remind everyone let's not

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,320
be hampered by these early guesses in

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,790
the infancy of our field and they were

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,130
guesses they're completely speculative

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:20,720
we're better than that so what I think

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,550
of when I think of empathy for

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,170
developers is putting ourselves into

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,870
another person's shoes when we're

00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,880
working with our code so it's primarily

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,620
cognitive it's perspective-taking

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,850
what the healthy dollop of empathic

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:38,900
concern speaking of emotions let's look

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:42,620
at some code how do you feel when you

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,040
look at this code I personally I feel

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,300
inadequate I have to look up I have to

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,970
remember where the standard scaler is

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,220
and what it does and then I have to go

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,250
back and wrack my brain and think what

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,970
are z-scores again and then I have to

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,120
try and wrap my head around

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,890
n-dimensional vector distance and so you

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,060
know I get that I work things out on a

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,920
piece of paper and I feel a little

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,760
better eventually that doesn't take away

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,890
that feeling of inadequacy so just raise

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,400
your hand if you know that feeling

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,170
whether it's z-scores NCS and statistics

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,090
or Z indices in CSS if you're not a

00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,500
front-end person that's the kind of Fe

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,960
I'm talking about we've all felt that

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,520
way at some point so you know it's not

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,950
an eight it's a skill we can all

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,510
practice it and these tips are a little

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,310
bit generic but I found them really

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:35,510
helpful but of course you know the

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,740
biggest thing is practice now being

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,090
curious about strangers doesn't

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,040
necessarily mean talking to random

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,450
people on the train and I'm from the

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,300
East Coast I know how uncomfortable that

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,220
is not to mention you know I'm a

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,780
straight sis man I don't have a lot of

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,810
security concerns that many other people

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,330
do but maybe interact with people that

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,550
you rarely interact with at work maybe

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,370
you know try and go beyond hey you know

00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,750
the the Rockies are doing great too what

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,890
brings them to work in the morning why

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,890
they're there on a particular day

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,990
Anthony is also a two-way street

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,880
and that means listening actively in my

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,680
experience a lot of people in

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,250
conversations they're kind of waiting

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,160
for their turn to say something

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,480
and building a little empathy means

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,290
practicing telling that voice in your

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,570
head to go shush a trick that I found

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,510
really useful is trying to come up with

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,180
a common feeling or experience based on

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,530
what they're saying right at that moment

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:35,670
which kind of forces me to pay attention

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,050
to what they're saying and then you can

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,540
yell come up with a common feeling and

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,220
be open to each other and be a little

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,290
bit emotionally vulnerable that helps

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,070
you to bond with someone else right

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,760
and finally there's expanding your

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,770
circle of empathy so going beyond the

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,390
usual suspects going beyond your friends

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,440
your teammates try and take the

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,930
perspective of someone you might

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,510
consider an adversary now I'm not

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,010
expecting you to have a blood feud right

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:05,250
if you're a Hatfield or a McCoy you have

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,570
bigger problems I get that but someone

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,210
who you rarely see eye to eye with

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,790
anyone like your landlord who won't fix

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,610
your leaking roof or you know the person

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,880
in HR who won't approve your time off or

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,880
anything like that

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,230
now I'm gonna steal an idea from our

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,330
friends who work in product management

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,780
and UX because I think they're really

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,130
onto something with their personas if

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,860
you find some of the ones that I'm gonna

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,979
put up helpful then feel free to steal

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,180
them or create your own but these are

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,120
just people you can imagine yourself

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,680
working with as a developer and I'm

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,440
gonna use them to demonstrate building

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,490
empathy throughout this talk this is Jen

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,530
Ginger's graduated from a well-known

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,089
local boot camp after a career in

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,830
journalism and he's very enthusiastic

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,010
but sometimes he needs a little

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,230
hand-holding

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,240
this is Tiffany Tiffany came to data

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,580
science from astrophysics so she knows

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,960
pandas and numpy inside and out but

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,370
sometimes she's thrown by Python

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,750
features like generators that she

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:12,000
doesn't touch very often this is Tania

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,530
Tania occasionally dusts off for

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,510
computer science degree and leaves

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,310
questions on a pull request but she

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,990
spends most of her time getting her team

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,670
the recognition that they deserve so

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,470
let's start with how we can bring a

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,089
little bit of empathic thinking in our

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,359
code itself

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:33,569
a thing that I regularly have to remind

00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:36,419
myself is that what seems clear as day

00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:39,689
to me is really kind of dark as mud to

00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:41,879
someone else and to bring that back to

00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:44,609
our personas something like asset

00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,799
comprehension that gin might find really

00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:50,519
elegant is a little too dense for

00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,349
Tiffany to rock and similarly you know

00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,329
the numpy Broadcasting function that

00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:59,429
Tiffany finds just so easy to understand

00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:00,479
or incomprehensible to Jen now we all

00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:01,709
know about names right they're one of

00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:04,139
the two hard things in computer science

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:07,739
right on with cache invalidation and

00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:10,799
off-by-one errors but they're also how

00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:12,779
we and our tools like our IDs refer to

00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,469
things and so they loom large in our

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,739
experience I want to start with them

00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:22,159
this is from the SyFy source code any

00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:28,139
guesses what that 8th argument does I

00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:34,379
have no idea this is from a popular iOS

00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:35,849
library AF networking now to its credit

00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,949
the sci-fi sample did have an enormous

00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:40,409
comment block explaining exactly what

00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:42,209
each parameter did but looking at this

00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,789
I'd still I find that I'd still rather

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:48,119
work with this iOS example and I barely

00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:50,429
know objective-c it's because you know I

00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:53,159
know what the method does I know what

00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:55,739
all of its arguments mean I can just

00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,849
look at it so let's bring it back to

00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:03,869
Python put yourself in Tonya's shoes and

00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:05,209
look at these lines of code imagine

00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:07,949
living in a world of JIRA tickets

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:11,249
surfacing only to glance occasionally at

00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:14,429
your latest team pull requests so you

00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:18,929
look at that in a diff how are you gonna

00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:21,679
feel maybe a little lost maybe also a

00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:24,629
little worried that you feel lost um

00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,949
well how about now I don't know about

00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:29,639
you I feel a lot better I'm like oh I

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:31,199
know what that does sort of so I'm

00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,819
saying you know if we can let a little

00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,919
bit of that empathic approach guide us

00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,809
when we're choosing names to start with

00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,799
then we end up with happier colleagues

00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,799
and more maintainable code

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,339
I'm not gonna go into this way too much

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,959
but the the TLDR

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:50,500
is at least in my opinion they're not

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,709
for you like it was totally comfortable

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,600
with this higher-order react component

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:59,920
raise your hand if you are I'm not okay

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,529
how about this slightly magical json

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,139
decoder okay so let's put our empathic

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,519
hats on and let's think of Tiffani

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,990
looking at this code because maybe it

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,050
was written to pull data into a model

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,410
that she built I'm kind of tensing up

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,630
hey are you I mean she has to look up

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,100
the JSON module documentation for the

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,310
slightly obscure object pairs Hulk

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,019
argument then she's got a refreshers

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,660
memory on regular expression syntax

00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:32,139
which as we all know is the clearest of

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,610
things and then she has to remember what

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,769
the star operator does when you applied

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,690
to a list comprehension which you know

00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:40,600
it's kind of syntactically awkward it

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,880
doesn't doesn't look obvious it's kind

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,709
of difficult and I just want to remind

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,589
everyone write to someone on your team

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,880
you're gonna be the Guru on a particular

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:54,550
piece of code and they can learn from

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,930
you use that opportunity like I said I'm

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,389
not gonna go into this too much there's

00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,560
lots of strong opinions out there

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:02,589
commenting too much commenting too

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,930
little sometimes not even at all there's

00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,540
lots but please watch Veronica hannises

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,339
talk on this subject because she takes a

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,110
much more in-depth look at it she

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,110
actually surveyed a lot of developers

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,430
and found that most people said comments

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,699
helped them remember what their code

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,279
does helps them clarify their thinking

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:23,170
and helps current and future developers

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,939
save time don't we want that for our

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,939
teams I know I want that for my dude

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,389
also some people may be familiar with

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,880
anti res the chap who wrote Redis has a

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,589
very descriptive blog he goes into nine

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,019
different types of comments and why he

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:46,810
likes each one also worth a look but

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:48,639
what frog watch piranhas stock first we

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,130
also you know we don't spend all of our

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,530
day in text editors so much of our day

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,870
involves working sort of near but not

00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:00,400
in code so let's talk about that for a

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,050
second many of us have seen or heard of

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,120
Tim Pope or Lin estar Vols in their

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,420
exportations about how to write good get

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,800
commit messages that's the kind of thing

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,250
more power to you that might be worth

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,320
reading I personally I find it more

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,330
useful to remember what good get commit

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,830
messages are supposed to be they're

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,170
supposed to tell a story that the code

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:24,640
can't you know the circumstances and the

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:28,750
reasoning behind each change so let's

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,070
put ourselves in the shoes of Jim let's

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,080
say he's looking through the set of

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,790
changes that make up a feature or even

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,090
worse he's using git bisect to hunt down

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,860
a buck Howard how do you think he's

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,810
gonna react when he sees a commit

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,820
message which might even highlight the

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:47,920
source of the bug that says fix it I'd

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,470
be exasperated can't even be a little

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,560
bit angry and eventually I see enough of

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:58,870
that and just get exhausted and working

00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,720
with exhausted people not super fun so I

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,760
don't have a one-size-fits-all answer

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,339
but I do have a few sets of tips that I

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,270
took from various blog posts and

00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,540
fundamentally I like to think about the

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,890
questions that Tanya would be asking

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,440
she'd be saying okay why did we need

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:20,680
this change how does it do what it does

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,020
are there any side effects and also

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,030
whether you use JIRA or Trello or github

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,650
issues or whatever you use links are

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:34,630
great they provide us a lot of context

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:36,370
so I've got a couple of links myself the

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,900
top post link here is where the tips on

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,160
the last slide actually come from it's

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,110
definitely worth reading in its entirety

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,450
and coming back to I actually have it

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,670
bookmarked but if you like tools then

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,860
there's a get message template here from

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,710
fat bots dot files repo which is super

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,890
useful there's also a project called

00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:01,720
commit isn't which helps you be a good

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:03,550
citizen with your commits clever name in

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,720
my opinion the most effective thing

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:09,779
though is this last tip coach your

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,399
to avoid git commit dash em because at

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,560
least I have found it way too easy to

00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,199
use that command-line option bash a few

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,939
keys and call it a day and every time

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,639
I'm tempted I think about gin in the

00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:26,389
middle of a bisect you know faced with

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,389
you know WASD and I try and think again

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,319
that's all well and good rummy you might

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,730
say but who uses just get commit

00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,889
messages these days I do everything in

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,240
github or get lab or whatever platform

00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:42,029
you may use I don't really think that

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,439
changes things personally I use github

00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,660
at work I use it for most of my

00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:47,490
open-source interactions I feel like

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,649
it's the same text that's there it's

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,899
conveying the same meaning and it's just

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:54,089
as helpful to me to figure out if an

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,709
open-source library included a bug-fix

00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,439
in its latest release from the commit

00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:01,829
messages as during a bisect in some

00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:03,029
internal project plus in a web interface

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:09,120
you can add screenshots I like

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:10,860
screenshots now of course we can't miss

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,230
perhaps the most important part of web

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,699
base code tools right that's where most

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,039
of our actual discussions around the

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,510
code come from and we all have to

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,730
remember that's the thing I have to

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,610
remind myself of regularly that when

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,780
we're reviewing someone else's code or

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,390
when we're responding to reviews of our

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,320
own code or when we're triaging an issue

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,370
or reporting an issue ourselves

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,200
inevitably there's another human being

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,600
reading something that we're putting out

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,370
and so if we put ourselves in Tiffany

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,380
shoes right and imagine the scenario

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,630
right she's a little peeved

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,590
they haven't included basic null checks

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,400
in a data set loader that you wrote and

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,690
you're inclined to just close that

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
discussion and be like it's not

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,870
necessary

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,220
whatever we're fine I checked that or

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,169
she leaves a wall of text in an issue

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,909
because she's really excited about a new

00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,490
convolutional neural that to think that

00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,630
she's been developing and you can't

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,870
really be bothered to hear about it

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,100
because it's not really your thing you

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,559
know whether we're met with resentment

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,289
in the former case or disappointment in

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,190
the latter either way it's not a great

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:15,530
emotional state to leave your colleague

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:19,110
in and a little empathy can avoid a lot

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:21,059
and while we're talking about github and

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,700
comments and issues let's take a moment

00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,500
to empathize explicitly with the

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,990
open-source maintainer 'he's that spend

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,550
so much of their time on their triaging

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,160
issues and reviewing code and often

00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,420
getting no thanks for it just you know

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,190
give them a second they deserve our

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:41,220
empathy more than most I'm not going to

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,230
beat the proverbial horse here Scott

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,850
already mentioned in the intro era

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,190
culture stuff about read the docs and

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,200
read the docs he and many others have

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,059
given better talks than I could on the

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,540
importance and ease of adding

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,010
documentation but let's put our empathy

00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,230
hats on and imagine a scenario with

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,530
Tanja she's trying to help her team out

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,030
and knock out a simple API integration

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,250
easy enough right but there's no

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,290
internal documentation so she has to

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,090
clone some code set up an environment

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,740
get it running locally just to figure

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,640
out what arguments to pass to this

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,380
method what constellation of disgruntled

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,850
feelings is she going to be experiencing

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,830
I personally I felt annoyed and then

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,740
confused and then really stupid and then

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,670
kind of smug and then anxious all of the

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,540
course of trying to figure out one

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:33,150
library function so even if you can't

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,030
stand you know your internal wiki we use

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:39,270
confluence at work and I can't stand it

00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,470
right but put up a couple likes and also

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,929
to take it back to the previous slide

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,390
for a moment if you're a creator or user

00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:48,660
of open source software and we kind of

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,730
all are then you're get commit messages

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,440
and your github PR discussions they are

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,730
documentation right because they're

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,559
public and they're searchable

00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,490
and someone is inevitably going to come

00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,710
across them when they're googling

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:03,059
something but most of us also spend a

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,350
lot of our time interacting with other

00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,420
folks in real time throughout the day

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,750
not just plowing through an endless sea

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,870
of code and documentation as much fun as

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,850
that might be so what role can empathy

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,220
play in a casual conversational forum

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,090
like slack you know beyond the role it

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,600
plays an actual face-to-face

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,890
conversation now obviously as with any

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,620
direct interactions between people

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,299
there's an endless

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,009
number of ways we could practice empathy

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:32,840
in the scenario but I'm gonna highlight

00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:35,240
one links links are kick-ass links are

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,919
wonderful links help Tiffany here

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,740
remember the details of a bug that she

00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,529
didn't write you know links show your

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,360
teammates what you're working on links

00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:46,340
and the ability of platforms like slack

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,960
to show previews critically they reduced

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,879
the cognitive load that we have to face

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,860
when we're dealing with a new context

00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:57,379
and give us the confidence to make

00:20:51,860 --> 00:21:01,100
intelligent decisions I was reminded

00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:02,779
recently that while most of us in the

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,190
world and academically recognize at this

00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:07,999
point that people have different

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,740
learning styles as developers we still

00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:12,139
mostly cater to a visual and sort of

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,789
text based learning even though people

00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,830
may be auditory learners or kinesthetic

00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:19,100
hands-on learners or lots of other

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,269
things so when I talk about white

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,090
boarding I'm not talking at interviews

00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,440
right that's a whole nother talk but

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,240
when I am talking about is using white

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,460
boards to help us communicate more

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,399
empathically to reframe the conversation

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,470
more visually or more kinesthetic Lee as

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,259
an interactive story for people who

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,139
learn and work better that way

00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:41,419
so for example Tonya here our team lead

00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:43,100
she's an interactive learner she can't

00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,570
really feel the impact of an

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,519
optimization we made to our clusters

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,919
performance until we've died rounded out

00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,330
together even though maybe to me

00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,299
it's plainness when I hear the numbers

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,610
recited now I recognize this is hard for

00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:58,009
larger teams or remote teams when I

00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,330
worked remotely and we had team

00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:01,070
get-togethers we'd spend a lot of our

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,259
time at whiteboards It was as if we were

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,740
making up for lost time you know which

00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:08,899
seems to underscore that you should you

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,059
should do it when you get a chance as a

00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:13,309
bonus a whiteboard session provides an

00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,499
explicit forum for explanation and for

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,269
discussion so we're a higher colleague

00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:19,820
may feel it's appropriate to ask a naive

00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,499
question or a more assertive colleague

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,970
statements can be diagrammed out and

00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:27,529
analyzed just like everyone else's for a

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,470
similar reason I'm a big fan of these

00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,450
informal team tactics at work because

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,269
not only is it a good way to reframe the

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,830
conversation for more auditory or

00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,790
interactive learners but it has a bonus

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,440
effect of formalizing and spreading

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,650
some knowledge and leave some artifacts

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,740
behind cuz you've got the slideshow like

00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,300
in this case our junior dev Jim might

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,440
feel more confident with public speaking

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,220
because of his background in journalism

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,500
and so the Tech Talk is a great way for

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,070
him to level up on a topic and gain

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,050
confidence in leading a discussion now

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,400
we've gone through some things that can

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,500
go well but it's also worth a quick

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,720
rundown of a few things I've seen that

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,430
don't work so well or sometimes are

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,470
actively against empathy with our fellow

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:16,170
developers like this attitude of strong

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,180
opinions loosely helped I've heard this

00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,250
called the worst idea in tech and I'm

00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,380
kind of inclined to agree because from

00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,720
what I understand it means you can make

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,760
unequivocal bombastic statements with

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,020
some sort of implicit shared assumption

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,470
that you'll change your mind in a

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,360
heartbeat

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,000
if you're given new data and it's

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,230
supposed to lead to a collegial

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,940
environment in which ideas get a

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,300
vigorous defense isn't that such a

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,450
lovely idea oh yes in my experience if

00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,860
there's any power differential or

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,090
personality difference involved like

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,700
let's say one person is a little more

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,080
senior than another or one person is a

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,890
little quieter and someone else is just

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,020
a little louder

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,190
in their style and I've seen that

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,320
dynamic especially true for

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,300
underrepresented groups in technology

00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,100
well that brings down completely and

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,740
shuts down the discussion and you know

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,830
the loud person wins that's that's not a

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,620
collegial environment like you know in

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,360
the example Tiffani Kant doesn't feel

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,340
that she can contribute anything and a

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,200
lot of discussions because the people

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,370
around her just sound so sure even

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,130
though she's got lots of data to back it

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,530
up and a trick that I found useful and

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,180
you know it's a good one to coach that I

00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,130
learned from a blogpost is to qualify

00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,670
all my strongly worded statements with a

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:33,720
percentage confidence like to say I'm

00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:37,230
97% sure we should not use MongoDB I'll

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,610
be honest I'm more than 97% sure

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,320
but that provides our data scientist in

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,570
this example who actually has data to

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,120
back her answer's up room to argue and

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:51,490
it makes me think how confident I lie

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:53,110
before words come out of my mouth who

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,159
hasn't been tempted to say oh yeah if

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,710
something goes wrong just come talk to

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,000
me I'm right over here I mean you know

00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,320
it sounds so welcoming right you're in

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,809
fighting this alone to come talk to you

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,000
and it's so much easier than writing

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,320
something up you know you have it easier

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,090
to explain in person you might say to

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,500
yourself or you have that lovely

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,789
whiteboard diagram that you came up with

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,360
when you were working it out in the

00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:15,250
first place

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,080
and who is the documentation anyway and

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,240
meanwhile you have your team lead here

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,279
left not wanting to bother you even

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,049
though she does have a problem because

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,269
you know well you said if there is a

00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:26,559
problem come talk to me and that kind of

00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:29,049
implies that there shouldn't be a

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,590
problem and so maybe she did something

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,860
wrong

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,490
she didn't do anything wrong and your

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,200
time is valuable and she knows that and

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,000
in my experience again when someone

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,039
takes me up on this and comes to talk to

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,919
me about something it's all flown out of

00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:47,529
my head by the time they come to talk to

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,960
me or I realize there's so much context

00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:51,730
that I haven't explained and it takes

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,580
longer and then I was busy at the time

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,429
and I'm completely derailed afterwards

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,629
and in the meantime my team lead here is

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,389
feeling really helpless before a meeting

00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:02,620
with senior management now take a second

00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,879
to think about that feeling helpless

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,659
before your meeting with senior

00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:08,799
management that's really not a pleasant

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:10,269
feeling I don't want to think about it

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,850
too much it's not something we want to

00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,649
inflict on our teammates a trick that

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,789
I've used is when I don't want to

00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:17,769
explain something properly

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,259
I imagine that I've been granted a

00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:23,139
30-second audience with master Yoda to

00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:26,110
explain it and I just jot down what

00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:27,940
comes out and more often than not I'm

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,500
Way too embarrassed by the result to

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,169
actually want to put that in any public

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,370
place so I clean it up but even if I'm

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:35,370
not it's a lot better than nothing

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,980
now we've also all heard that most of

00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:43,629
communication is nonverbal text has no

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,130
tone it's really easy to miss

00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:48,440
communicate that's all true

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,170
I also creates my opinion the biggest

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,270
empathy gap because you can read

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,710
anything into a message based on your

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,950
emotional state I know that's true for

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:00,020
me like gin here doesn't know how to

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:04,190
call out a senior colleague on their

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,750
mistake so he agonizes over every word

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,010
in a comment on a pull request because

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,090
he doesn't know how to defang everything

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:12,860
with a smile and I'm not gonna suggest

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,410
that we should immediately stop doing

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,610
anything remotely and start doing

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,870
everything face to face in an office

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,610
because that's really inefficient it's

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,950
limiting doesn't fit how many of us work

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,690
best but we should fully use the media

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:29,320
we have video calls quick phone calls

00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:34,190
one that might be a little controversial

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,390
emojis so I'm gonna I'm running out of

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,120
time so I'm gonna use this real quick

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,520
but I learned from a book by a guy

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,260
called from car from a guy called John

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,570
recorder all the words on the move

00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,640
about how emojis play the part of

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,580
pragmatic markers in language these days

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,710
how dare you form the Winx that tones a

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,440
voice that I know right the the filler

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,720
words and they're super easy so we

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,600
should use them enable our textual

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,070
language to be a lot richer and a dry

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,550
run of this talk I was asked if someone

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:08,570
could use gifts or memes you can i'm

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:10,250
meme challenged i prefer not to the

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,660
final one that i want to bring up is too

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,780
many templates i've seen

00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:17,060
well-intentioned form like this so often

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,770
security checklists jared tickets pull

00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,750
request templates I see them backfiring

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:26,990
all the time please don't overuse them

00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,460
but to sum up empathy is not innate it's

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,430
a skill we can all build a little

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,620
practice there are lots of places that

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:36,650
we can and we should apply it in our

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:40,190
everyday work and we need this in our

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,390
industry finally if you've really

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,340
enjoyed what I've been saying and you

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,890
want a minute for senior management to

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,360
build empathy and your team the Harvard

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,470
Business Review has to do it right that

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,180
always convinces the c-suite thank you

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,290
so much for listening I hope that you

00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,420
try at least one of the things that I've

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,910
mentioned and I don't have time for Q&A

00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,350
but I'd love to come talk

00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,480
to talk about this any time afterwards

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,920
please come find

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:19,229
[Applause]

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:19,229
