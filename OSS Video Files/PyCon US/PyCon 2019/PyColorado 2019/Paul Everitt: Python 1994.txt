Title: Paul Everitt: Python 1994
Publication date: 2019-10-22
Playlist: PyColorado 2019
Description: 
	“Come for the language, stay for the community.” The Python community started in 1994 at a NIST workshop in Maryland. What was the world of Python like in its first years? Did we have any clue whatsoever? A joke-focused tour of early Python, heavy on question-and-answer.

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,950
needless to say I'm not standing behind

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,180
the podium for obvious reasons I'll go

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,750
ahead and get this out of the way

00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Luce what the hell how am I supposed to

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,400
follow that I feel so inadequate you

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,019
took like I can't program but I could

00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,140
give presentations and now I can't even

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,450
have that thanks a lot man

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,190
no brilliant job at least I got to sit

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:17,700
on the front row while genius rode into

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:19,020
town I also want to jump into I want to

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,740
go ahead and give a little bit of a

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,289
shout-out you've got to be crazy to

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,310
organize a conference starting a

00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:32,310
conference whole new level of insanity

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,560
so Scott Frank the entire PI Colorado

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,410
team you've created something wonderful

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,780
and different and distinct kudos to you

00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,710
kudos all of you for coming bring

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,710
someone next year

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,480
[Applause]

00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:57,830
also I want to give a shout-out to our

00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:00,830
hostess Jim Fulton who's going to be a

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,230
part of my presentation Jim's my oldest

00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:09,050
friend in Python as well as my colleague

00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:13,100
and I'll try and sum it up this way most

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:16,730
of us would be very lucky to have and

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,180
deliver one killer idea in our career it

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,580
would take two hands to count the things

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,160
that Jim has done and you'd still forget

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,459
which I in doing some review this

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,320
morning was like Oh restructuredtext

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,860
structure text Jim announced that in

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,810
1996 fabulous things that he's done

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,989
under the over the years thank you for

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,989
everything

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:45,110
[Applause]

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,280
I was joking with this gaggle who's

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,920
going to have a good question for me

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,450
later that I used to do my warm-up joke

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,819
was what were you doing in 1994 when the

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,180
majority answer became waiting to be

00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:02,980
conceived I dropped that joke I mean

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:06,890
it's funny in a nursing-home kind of way

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:10,069
but I get enough of that anyway so

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:17,840
instead let's go back to the topic of

00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:21,139
this talk it's November 1994 there's a

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:27,950
Clinton in the White House this slide

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:35,599
was a lot funnier three years ago number

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:37,579
one movie in November 1994 I enjoy

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,090
listening to the last kind of catch up a

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:43,579
little you could order books without

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,870
leaving the house just to explain books

00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,819
or these things that you go to

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,949
bookstores and they've got him on

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:55,310
shelves you gonna order books you would

00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:58,280
go over to Windows 3.1 and you would

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:04,609
open AOL or NCSA mosaic you'd hoping

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:07,129
it's a it's a mosaic several minutes

00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,379
later you would order a book and it

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:13,099
would show up at your house is it this

00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:20,329
so cool look at this preached EML - oh

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:23,000
isn't that just gorgeous this one what a

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,909
catch a little time one thing so cute

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,229
back then and just the layout of it like

00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:32,990
get your tables off my long pre tables

00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:34,849
but what else happened in 1994 the

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,830
Python community started and that's the

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,840
topic of this talk what happened then

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,720
why do we say it happened then and what

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,539
I'll try and do is frame this a little

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,110
bit in the what happened just before

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:49,520
what happened then and then up to 2000

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,389
in that little time period

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,830
I intend this to be a conversation I

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,890
have a job

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:01,220
do it isn't to inform you it's to

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:05,030
entertain you I will say some things

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,120
that are true by accident if you let me

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,910
know I'll remove them but it's also your

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,730
job to ask questions say funny stories

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,260
and entertain me don't wait to stick

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,600
your hand up if you've got something

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,950
funny to say if it's true even better a

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
little bit about me I've done some

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:28,340
things over the years the thing relevant

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,460
to this talk is in 1993 I did a web

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,060
server for the Navy like everything else

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,880
in this stupid talk it's a funny story

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,300
to include this is the first existence

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,780
of Paulie on the interwebs hey I'm

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:50,860
having trouble compiling this Marc

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:55,040
Andreessen undergraduate programmer at

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:58,700
NCSA in Illinois or whatever answers my

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,710
question my tech support question our

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:08,750
lives went in different paths after this

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:11,120
but I was kind of cute and also my

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,430
Python story a little bit from that same

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,470
time period was its mentioned a little

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,180
bit in there was I needed a scripting

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,820
language I kind of an extension system

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,430
this is pre CGI and back then you had

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,600
choices some people were doing things in

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:34,340
C and not likely something people were

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,110
doing things in bash and then people

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,030
were doing things in Perl like okay that

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,970
sounds alright so I go to the the

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,300
bookstore that thing with books and I go

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,190
to the computer section and I get the

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,980
Perl book out I've got a vivid memory of

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,940
this this one is true I pull the poor

00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,940
book out and like Oh

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:03,520
and there's this thing online it's a

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:06,430
Python tutorial PostScript pre PDF and

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,279
you could print it you can read it and I

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,249
did it is like genetically engineered

00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,259
for my brain I could understand this

00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:16,389
thing and that was my Python origin

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,849
story you had time laughter words come

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:24,729
and hear the funny story of what

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:26,349
happened just after that so pre-1994

00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,840
that's kind of my Python origin story

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,240
what's going on at the time what was how

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,210
did we get there for Guido there's a

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,889
really good article that's come out now

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,870
it's ZDNet I think it came out like two

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,379
or three weeks ago this guy did his

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,930
homework there's this some good

00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:46,210
background in there about what was

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,219
gritos background I won't go into it too

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,189
much but he was on a programming

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:53,469
language project called ABC at CWI a

00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,379
Research Institute in the Netherlands it

00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:59,050
didn't work but he learned a lot and the

00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,460
team disbanded Neil was over Christmas

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,750
or something and he said I never ride

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,759
programming languages it learns from

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,969
those lessons and I'm just gonna give it

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,659
away

00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:10,449
and as Guido pointed out when we did the

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:12,370
keynote panel I believe he said the

00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,729
reason I come was successful was because

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:20,639
the internet existed if this would have

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:23,139
been two years earlier when ABC failed

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,240
Python would have failed because no one

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,129
would have noticed there was actually

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,689
some way to give it away for free and

00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:33,219
for people to for him to reach people so

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,550
that's a little bit about Guido story

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:39,099
and the Millia you like that fancy word

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,380
the milieu at the time was there were

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,699
these languages that were higher level

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,699
than some of the systems programming

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:48,160
languages and they were labeled

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,350
scripting languages where the grown-ups

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,019
would say you and your scripting links

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,970
how cute will bring the girl nuts back

00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,500
later will reimplemented and C or

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,540
something like that and so there was

00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,740
this pile of scripting languages at the

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,829
time that we're kind of competing with

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,440
each other Perl was bigger than bigger

00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:08,890
than big everyone was doing Perl tickle

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,209
TK audience participation raise your

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,369
hand if you know what TCL's

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:20,850
stands for and your name's not Jim

00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:24,490
Fulton or Jim Baker or Moshe anyone yes

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:31,839
you are the first person to ever get the

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:34,059
tea right yay for you did I tell you

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,999
I've got some funny stories so there's a

00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:39,759
funny story about this so this is the

00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,529
first Python book we don't commit Aaron

00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,959
waters I think really was the primary

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,059
author of it and they wrote the book and

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,569
they're like hey II we need cover work

00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:51,069
and Jim and I had our company in

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:53,350
Fredericksburg Virginia at that time and

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:56,589
we paid a graphics artist named Nancy

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:59,949
yeah we'll do it so Nancy comes to Paul

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:05,410
and she says what do I put on the cover

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:09,429
and I'm like the snake glasses Candice

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:13,689
Pam then there gets you the ugliest book

00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:18,100
cover in computer literature history not

00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:24,069
her fault that guidos fault probably my

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,990
fault we know at that keynote panel at

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:29,139
PyCon a number of years ago brought this

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:33,970
up Python had around that time a mailing

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:36,399
list in my mailing list what he means is

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,569
and that's a leases file or something

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,299
that he edited by hand and as the Python

00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,339
community grew that job became a little

00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,379
bit more cumbersome and we don't know

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:50,769
that he has succeeded when he could hand

00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:52,209
that job over to somebody else but that

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:56,769
was how we organized ourselves

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:58,809
we also had o compress sometime maybe

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:02,519
you give me the correction on this there

00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:05,769
was some year where a gateway to this

00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,529
magical thing called Usenet news in NTP

00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:12,369
arrived and there was a news group comp

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:16,899
dot link Python and is burying guido

00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:21,129
point out there's comp in the name right

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:23,540
there's comp there's laying oh it's a

00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:25,639
Monty Python fan group and

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,410
so half of the messages in the early

00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,910
days or people coming in wanting to talk

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:35,269
about cheese shops kids you can never

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,389
ever be smart enough to be idiot proof

00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:42,199
the number of idiots is always going to

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:46,250
be plus one all right this is the very

00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:50,899
first email to the community from Guido

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:53,420
no not 15 minutes not 51 we're not even

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,089
close this is the first email from wheat

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,380
I promise I gave a version of this I

00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,880
think I told you I gave a version of

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,360
this in Saint Petersburg Russia that

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:08,269
went for two and a half hours I'll come

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,699
in under that this is the introductory

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,410
email from Guido to the mail of us

00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,660
explaining the rules of rogue pretty

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,540
cool normal blah blah blah this is the

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,029
very second email this is so cute

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:25,040
first of all up here he has to explain

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:25,550
how replies work oh and then this is

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,360
funny

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:33,980
someday yeah mad day never came did it

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,819
now I do want to go back and do another

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:42,319
audience participation thing this all

00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:49,430
right here's the Wikipedia page get your

00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:51,529
cars ready on this alright audience

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:56,529
participation raise your hand if you

00:12:51,529 --> 00:13:02,949
know what uucp means you got up first go

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:05,720
yes good alright next who knows that I

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:10,310
don't know if I you know I think you

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:14,810
knew the first one say no no you yes

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:17,180
plain old telephone service all right do

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:24,860
you remember when 33.3 was like

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:28,490
blisteringly fast infinity this is my

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,939
very first email to the Python mailing

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:36,480
list those of you who may know me this

00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:38,940
is the funniest paulius message

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,150
the very first thing I talked about was

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,640
my blathering about Python persistence

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:49,410
and objects and stuff on the web and

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:53,340
things then going into the workshop

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:56,250
before we kind of even convened this

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,740
meme started raise your hand if you've

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,300
ever seen this meme reference before

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,160
what if Guido got hit by a bus I want to

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,210
see if that's still popular all right

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,530
not that many I thought there would be

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,500
more than that especially with what

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,880
happened recently

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,140
narrator Guido didn't get hit by a bus

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:18,210
Guido ran over himself I should say that

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:19,380
and as as was the time it was all framed

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,990
in terms of a joke

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,660
and then what would happen if Python

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,460
actually went somewhere and Guido

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,050
departed went on to some other thing or

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,810
whatever what would happen to the rest

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,610
of us a little bit of for thinking even

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,920
though there were not that many people

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,450
involved what do I mean when I say not

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,350
that many people involved we'll get to

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,180
that in just second just I thought I

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,560
would throw this one in for all of you

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:49,650
language geeks from the Bary damn

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:55,080
beginning guido expresses his eternal

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:57,870
love for lambdas I should edit that and

00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,820
change it to be like oh my god I really

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,820
should have done first-class landmarks

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:10,140
and if I give enough speeches and say

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:14,400
that it will become the truth now here's

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:18,420
kind of the crux of it 1994 November

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,880
1994 a workshop was organized which kind

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,840
of kicks off the birth of the Python

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,480
community you may say to me Paul you've

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,550
lied to us so far on everything that's

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,340
come out of your mouth is that this a

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,530
lie and I would say no don't X not this

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,830
actually did happen and you would say I

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:41,400
demand proof and I say proof

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:45,710
you shall have stand up this is the

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,710
t-shirt from that conference

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,650
[Applause]

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,020
because captain buzzkill won't let me do

00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:00,610
to our talk I've got a funny joke about

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,790
my shirt of that I'll tell you later so

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,709
we announced a workshop at NIST National

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,950
Institute the standards Gaithersburg

00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:15,420
Maryland boring windowless office

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:18,790
building with room for up to 20 people

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:26,560
who would need that much space it was

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:28,240
infinity and we put together a agenda in

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,430
advance what kinds of things should we

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,709
talk about at this workshop audience

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,920
participation moment read through that

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:37,990
list while I'm blathering and see if

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,839
there's something on that list that

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,330
still bugs you all right keep reading

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:47,100
keep reading keep reading all right

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,100
butcher goes first what is it motion

00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:55,170
which number number three thank you did

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,910
you do that for me did you do that for

00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:01,900
anybody got anybody else build your hand

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,740
up for something all right anybody got

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:11,069
one that bugs them yes

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:15,459
number one he worked hard on that

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:18,339
anybody else got anything all right my

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:22,150
only right was your hand up number six

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:28,600
Oh we'll get to that I've got a slide

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:31,030
for that all right yes number eight hmm

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,700
you would say that wouldn't you the

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,170
language professor this is the only

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,480
thing I worked on which was funny

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,570
because it was a complete utter and

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,300
comical failure here we are at November

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,670
1994 with all of 20 people in Michael

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:53,350
McClain and I are writing bylaws for a

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:59,480
consortium a pictures to prove it happen

00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:02,210
yeah hey wait wait too much too much so

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,610
this is Guido talking to his future

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,610
co-workers Roger Massey berry Warsaw

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,650
Michel McClay the unsung hero in the

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,850
entire history of Python if not for him

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,289
organizing this and some other things

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,539
that he did later we might not be

00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:26,240
talking to each other this is a picture

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:28,399
of berry Warsaw on the inside my man Jim

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,630
and this is me before I got married and

00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:35,480
learned you could spend more than five

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:37,190
dollars on a haircut so what was it like

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,409
well the nice thing is none of you were

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,080
there so I can say whatever I want

00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:45,549
we had grand strategic visions which

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,730
came to fruition exactly as we planned

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:52,340
no it felt a little bit like something

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,640
that there was a there there but it also

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:59,390
felt like just the nice collegial people

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,500
enjoying a technology but Amy keep going

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,260
back and forth on some of these things

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,880
but some of the seeds got planted there

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,200
that grew into the thing that grew into

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,679
the thing that grew into the thing do

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:15,380
you have anything that you what that you

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:21,919
have is your big takeaway persistence of

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:24,440
course you would say that coming out of

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,320
that what did that November 1994 it

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,480
shouldn't have meant anything mean we'll

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,179
go through the next couple of years of

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:39,169
Python the Python community and the

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:42,470
larger royal Python we had a can I say

00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:45,740
shitload I say Laura we had a

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,480
shitload of these people wandering and

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,620
couldn't be bothered to go read the

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,350
previous 500 shitloads preach you my

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,080
food for me answer this question about

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:01,669
how do you stack up against these do you

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,770
notice a name that's not up there Java

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:06,560
had not arrived I'll talk about that in

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:09,980
a couple of slides later

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:14,000
so we had a lot of that then we had

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,830
another workshop organized by my man Jim

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,450
who organized the third workshop as well

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:28,550
and this time we might hit 20 it was

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:31,700
also a it wasn't a windowless government

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:34,190
office building it had windows but again

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:39,650
the chairs didn't have padding those

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:43,370
chairs were yeah but this one this is

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:49,010
the Menlo Park one right this one had an

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:52,700
interesting point which I swear to god

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,540
it matches what I'm about to say oh my

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,050
god

00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:07,220
a guy presenting sons set-top

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:08,810
programming language named named Java it

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,460
didn't even have the name Java then he

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:17,810
was talking about it it also had that's

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:20,870
cool it also had two guys from the

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:27,680
Stanford digital library project talking

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:29,090
about their project named some of you

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:36,290
said yeah if you don't know what it is

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:41,060
you could google it yes Google at that

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:44,660
time was written in Python and there is

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,490
some dispute amongst us barry and guido

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,940
Jim and me about whether either those

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,630
points are actually true but as the one

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,290
with the microphone

00:21:50,630 --> 00:22:00,410
I declared them true that good one too

00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:02,360
far no all right then things start to

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,190
organize a little more formally this is

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,200
the start of the thing before the thing

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,240
we know the thing the Python Software

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,030
Foundation there was a thing before that

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,700
called the PSA Python software activity

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:16,880
which started somewhere in the 1995

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,680
timeframe organized a little bit under

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,680
CNRI a little bit under our company

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,600
digital creations

00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,400
probably the wrong solution for the

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,800
wrong problem I think that's probably

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,660
the best way to put it but a step that

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,530
needed to be take on taking on the way

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,120
to the right step later a little bit

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,990
more on Python community and

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,570
organization this is not 1995 but it's a

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,850
way for me to talk about 1995 we had

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,590
organized into special interest groups

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,410
people interested about certain topics

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,650
as a way to kind of scale manpower

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:55,370
middle management and there was a sig

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,230
that was it Andrew yeah Andrew couch

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,690
Elaine the catalogs sig which was the

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,530
successor to the very first sig the

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:10,010
locator sig my sig it didn't deliver a

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:12,710
damn thing which is unsurprising we had

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,320
a third workshop hosted by Jim this one

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:19,640
was a little bit different the seats had

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,860
cushions in Reston Virginia no that was

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,440
another USGS office another USGS office

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,740
this one was bigger this was organized

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,570
and almost have like tracks and things I

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,820
remember no one else does making

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:36,110
everyone else wrong and me right this

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:40,370
was where proof of numeric began raise

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:41,870
your hand if you ever use numeric who

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,020
change their hand though you're like

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:50,300
maybe I did yeah all right all right

00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:53,210
cool numeric now being the prehistory of

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,010
the thing saving pythons bacon anything

00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:00,110
else were Thursday yeah all right oh

00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:05,150
yeah my will be gotten locator C Guido

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:06,740
left Europe and got employment at the

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:10,900
corporation for national resource

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,460
initiative CNRI in Reston Virginia

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,500
nonprofit doing research in the public

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,540
interest

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:21,440
headed by a guy named Bob Kahn Bob

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:23,110
describes himself as the creator of the

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,150
Internet the founder of the Internet

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,280
he did a lot of the math and was a

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,420
project manager for Vinton Cerf that

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,390
created tcp/ip

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,810
I'll give him some of that credit Bob's

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,400
wife Patrice with

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,950
an intellectual property lawyer Bob's

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,820
right-hand man Alves Arang conferences

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:44,130
will return to the theme in a moment but

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,040
Guido went there and got a team together

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:51,300
kind of called Python labs a lot of the

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,450
famous people berry Warsaw

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,870
Jeremy Hilton Fred Drake Ken Mannheimer

00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,690
Guido

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,650
Roger Massey and that's it right close

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,790
enough

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:07,610
they made a web browser in Python using

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:10,980
all the Beauty one gets with TK in ER as

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,540
part of a project to do mobile code that

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,340
was one of the research projects that

00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,800
they were going to do that was going to

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,390
bring in a lot of funding they also did

00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,910
it the handle system which was a

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,380
successor to DNS in a number of other

00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,380
things so they were there for five years

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,390
doing some core Python doing some other

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,240
things that promoted Python in CNR I was

00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:37,020
acting as the home for Python community

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:42,690
activities and possibly intellectual

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:44,790
property dun-dun-dun I mention al Vesna

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,540
that right-hand man for tech was a

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:50,340
conference organizing company

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,980
professional high end semi expensive

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,780
conferences they did the world wide web

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,530
consortium conferences which were a

00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,000
thing not just a thing they were a huge

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,040
thousands of people thing they did the

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,860
IETF conferences I think they did some

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,670
others and they took away our spam

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,160
conferences change them into the IPC's

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,930
international Python conferences and

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,940
rates went up and the professionalism

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:19,520
went up and it just kind of changed a

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,520
little bit I'm gonna doing on time

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:31,640
perfect under an hour right now I will

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,650
make my own demarcation and say python

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,620
is separated the history of Python is

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:40,430
separated into thirds and I will choose

00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:43,520
the year 2000 as the pivot point the

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:46,700
ending of the first third and the

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:52,100
beginning of the second third several

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:54,470
things happen in that time frame as /

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,610
thought points out here Guido and team

00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:02,090
left CNRI and went to a dot-com startup

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:06,470
in Silicon Valley called be open what

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:10,820
could go wrong this went wrong it folded

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:13,430
eight months later I will try to not

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,140
give us too big of a pat on the back

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,170
mostly because I can't really reach my

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,960
back but we did a solid for the Python

00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,510
community we employed the five of them

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,980
for three years narrator they're pretty

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:30,110
expensive and if you go to look in the

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,090
Python license file you'll see a lot of

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,580
names in there one name you won't see as

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:37,040
digital creations because we wrote into

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,160
their employment agreement protection

00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:43,040
against us that any work they did on

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:47,050
Python core Python the intellectual

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,050
property would be owned by them not us

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,580
so I'll call this is a little bit of a

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:56,240
pivot point in the year 2000 several

00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:59,240
things coming together one of the things

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,630
the precipitating events at CNRI from my

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,760
perspective at least Guido has done some

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,890
interviews with the computer museum

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,610
online they're really good he talks

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:14,450
about this a little bit see in our eyes

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:21,050
mode was to come up with good stuff and

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:23,570
license it licensing meaning revenue to

00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:27,860
sustain future development things were

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:30,010
afoot to try and get Python to be

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,520
successful in that model

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,640
I've asked Barry this one could imagine

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,370
that

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,670
the history of Python at CNI would in a

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,680
state at CNRI would be a licensed model

00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:46,730
would we be sitting here right now if

00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,230
that happened Halen oh so between that

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,550
and the license issues like there's

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,020
there was a one point six point oh

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,420
release and a one point six point one

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,720
release a couple of days later purely to

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,030
satisfy a negotiated agreement to stick

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,500
their name in the license file for the

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:08,420
rest of eternity for tech in 2000 was

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:11,800
busy organizing their last Python

00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:15,710
conference which would be a year later

00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,060
their model didn't work it became the

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,490
work of the community to pick it back up

00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:22,040
as the Python conference later and make

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:27,500
it successful so the history of the

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:30,590
community and its compris was unstable

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,990
in addition to the intellectual property

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,540
and the core team so the core team the

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,630
manpower takes off and goes to this

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:43,220
thing which then collapses and one could

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:45,830
have imagined the IP issue the

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,540
conference issue and then the five main

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,600
developers scattered to the wind

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,990
possibly never to do Python again nice

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,240
little inflection points a bit so with

00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:08,030
that in mind the best two words in any

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:10,220
presentation dustin europe and even

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,900
close with the same thing i'm going to

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,360
close with so i took a picture of it and

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,790
put it in as the slide and then she's

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,600
like wait so if i get a picture of that

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:22,430
and use it in my next presentation we

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:28,510
get a picture and use it in your next

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,510
presentation we've achieved inception

00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,650
i've talked about the first what i

00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,800
consider the first third of python the

00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,690
story of python in the beginning the

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,100
origin of the community some things that

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:45,710
happen some lessons that could be

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:49,160
learned some jokes along the way and

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,720
in my opinion it all paves the way for

00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,270
the second third of Python

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,360
I think the second third of Python is

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:59,330
the real Python the rise of the PSF is

00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,950
an entity that can go out and actually

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,110
accomplish things

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,120
highly distinct from other programming

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,100
language environments the rise of

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,390
freaking PyCon and all the regional

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,430
conferences well-organized volunteer-run

00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:17,240
providing income to go out and

00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:19,700
accomplish strategic objectives and then

00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,760
the rise of some of the programming

00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,770
systems Jango and flask that we use kind

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,890
of paving the way to the third third of

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:30,620
Python the bounty that we all are able

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,260
to avail ourselves of and then data

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,660
science and then we were talking about

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,640
local meetups you were mentioning that

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,630
local meetups like almost everyone are

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:44,300
new to Python and so I'll do my in

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:49,850
conclusion and do my sort of the future

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:53,210
like Ava similarly which is I gave this

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:58,280
talk at Euro Python clever people

00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:01,100
noticed 3/3 implying we're finished so I

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:04,550
will say I will be a mathematical and

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:08,360
invent the fourth third we are about to

00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:12,530
enter a fourth third where a lot of us

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,540
are here just to support you and the new

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,370
heroes will emerge and the new story

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,650
will be told Lukesh longa has a

00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,130
wonderful keynote from Pyland in iam

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:26,060
talking about Python 2020 and don't be

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:29,240
bound by what was all of you in the

00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:31,820
fourth bird go make it be your own thing

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,410
go make your own Python be your own

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:38,180
Python community set your own agenda and

00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,410
that really is the way we should be

00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,050
thinking about this

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,860
the next story of Python is going to be

00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,990
fascinating we will be the ones watching

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,780
sitting in the audience is the next

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,860
Python badass let that badass be you

00:32:50,780 --> 00:33:03,539
thank you

00:32:52,860 --> 00:33:05,640
I will not be doing slam poetry I've got

00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,830
questions I will don't make me press the

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,840
slide to the next question I'll ask the

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,929
questions if you want that was almost a

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:19,830
question question anybody got a funny

00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:21,240
story okay yes ready okay funny stood

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,889
all right thanks

00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:29,070
so see this is funny I get this I get

00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:31,200
this python tutorial I'm learning it but

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:35,880
I'm about to go on vacation of all

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:42,630
places France to make this woman that I

00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:49,220
was dating and I take my left to 86

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:51,929
compact laptop and in her kitchen I'm

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:57,620
reading and going through the python

00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:57,620
tutorial and she married me anyway

00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:04,059
[Applause]

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,500
also sacrificing the right to ever

00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:15,300
complain because you were fully aware

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:19,210
next question was pythons culture set in

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:22,060
1994 we could say yes probably not true

00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:27,700
but probably partially true a number of

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:30,990
the other cultures were very unwelcoming

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,460
Jim were you and I talking about Perl

00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:36,190
and you were mentioning that the Perl

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:43,000
community was not exactly a warm and

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:45,520
cuddly place possibly and Python was and

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,780
Jim has a good point made a good point

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,260
at that keynote panel on the Y and his

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,000
phrase was hope I get this right

00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:59,650
Python is warm and human because Guido

00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,780
is warm in human and I think that's did

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,430
I get it right and I think that's an

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,920
important part of the story things could

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,109
have gone differently we remain a great

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,530
warm community and other places are just

00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:13,000
toxic

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,589
why do Python succeed while others

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,109
doesn't I didn't open this one up for

00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:22,750
discussion anybody have any opinions

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:26,849
BuChE why us not them it's readable

00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,849
all right person

00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:35,269
government office buildings ok

00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,269
readability good who's got another one

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:47,809
general-purpose all right look the also

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,809
known as the right answer yes yeah

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:56,730
the because it wasn't such a thing in

00:35:51,720 --> 00:36:20,460
the beginning right but the

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:22,860
standardization of it so Jim's point is

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,030
the capi was the thing and maybe that

00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,940
matches up to the scripting language

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,220
thing that says sure you can have a huge

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,610
surface area under the water that's in

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:36,180
sea and then the humans get to engage it

00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:38,880
at a more humane level okay I'm gonna

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,540
ask so I have more time no I don't need

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:46,320
you anymore

00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:52,490
do I have more time one ish hey one all

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:55,350
right yes you think of Earth Earth days

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,990
one that came up in Saint Petersburg was

00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:01,500
in the third third what has caused the

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:03,450
rise and I did audience participation on

00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,270
it and most people got the most obvious

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:11,670
answer data science I would also say

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:15,420
women also underrepresented groups that

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:18,990
Python with PyCon and the PSF had a

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,060
strategy executed and succeeded to the

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,700
point that PyCon went from having like

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,070
3% speaker participation that we're

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,450
women to 37% or something like that it

00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:33,650
didn't happen by accident go ahead

00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:37,490
[Applause]

00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,809
and so as the the guy who's going to be

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:41,980
going back to the nursing home is

00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:46,009
shuffleboard time it's my job to help

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,480
make that next 4/3 happen and I last

00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:49,759

called my wife and talked to her the

00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:53,799
person who drove me drove us to the

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,839
