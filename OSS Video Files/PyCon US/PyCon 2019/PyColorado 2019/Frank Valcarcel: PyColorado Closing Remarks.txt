00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,059
I just wrote this today so let's not

00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,870
bother I'm gonna be looking at these

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,600
notes the entire time I have been to a

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,670
lot of conferences I've had a very

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,480
distinct pleasure and privileged to do

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:05,670
so I've been to a lot of PI cons my

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,930
first PyCon was five years ago and it

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:14,009
was in Montreal and I felt pretty

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,810
freaking special to be able to go so I'm

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,850
saying this cuz I've also been to a lot

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,229
of regionals I'm saying this to tell you

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,970
that I've also seen a lot of closing

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:26,759
remarks and I feel like a normal person

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,320
would have referenced that and used it

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:35,580
as notes and stuck to the script but I

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,840
am NOT well I'm normal I'm just not like

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,000
everyone else you know I'm a little

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,670
different Jay told you we do things a

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,229
little bit differently here I also don't

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:50,070
think that this is you know a typical

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:53,549
regional well let's see where are we

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,070
gonna go with things I am gonna cover a

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,310
couple facts and first I'd like to give

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,640
you a report on conduct I'm very pleased

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,479
to announce that as of now we've had

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,860
only two conduct violations reported and

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,610
they weren't actually committed by any

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,610
of the attendees

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,540
there was a bike stolen yesterday from

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,070
out front it did belong to an attendee

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,300
and then there her see now infamous

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,590
ketchup ketchup incident that I I'm

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,000
knock it happened in the park yesterday

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,420
during lunch I'm not going to talk about

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,170
it but if you see me sometime I'll tell

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,960
you the story it's a good one that means

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,270
that all of y'all have been an exemplary

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,360
model for what makes the Python

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:54,520
community what it is so one more round

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:57,910
of applause for yourselves and also we

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,620
the organizers thank you very much all

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,940
right that doesn't mean that I'm going

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,530
to skip over important information as an

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,530
engineer I understand the importance of

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,420
data as qualitative sorry got that

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,210
backwards quantitative representation to

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,690
any event and we're going to share with

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:22,240
you all all of it because data is how we

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:24,070
measure what happened however we are

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,950
going to take a major detour and look at

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:31,750
the qualitative side because that's what

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:35,470
I think tells us how it happened okay so

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,900
let's go by the numbers we're committed

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,160
to full transparency here and I have

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,680
confirmed with all of the organizers

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,630
that I'm allowed to say this that will

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,350
forever be a core value of pi' Colorado

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:51,640
I don't want you to make any mistakes we

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:53,650
are not a nonprofit pike cholera has

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,970
been planned executed and carried out by

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,970
a small team of very passionate

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,660
volunteers no one here earns anything

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,420
for the work that they put into us so

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,450
let's start with attendance okay we set

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,190
a goal of having 350 attendees that was

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,330
including ourselves the organizers

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,100
speakers exhibitors we sold two hundred

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,510
and fifty four tickets between the

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,730
conference and the workshops combined as

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,500
you know we had two days of talks

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,140
sixteen total plus two great keynotes

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,220
and two workshops on Friday

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,770
now you know what we're working with

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,940
right let's look at the economics

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,910
involved to make this thing actually

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,350
happen the total income for the

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,420
conference was ninety one thousand one

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,010
hundred and ninety dollars we actually

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,980
don't know if that's good for a first

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,710
year conference we don't have anything

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,180
to compare it to the sales number here

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,550
actually aggregates all tickets and

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,370
t-shirt pre-sales and I will mention

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,800
that this is gross revenue and we

00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:01,310
haven't factored in t-shirt sales from

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:05,370
today yet so that will get at it as well

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,290
venue costs include this space sculpture

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,700
park the food trucks catering speaker

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,580
dinner opening reception and the

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,700
workshops operations are things like

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,120
signage badges insurance email and web

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,200
services videography marketing we're

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,520
including anything printed and digital

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,520
stickers artwork the motion graphics

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,830
that have been running all weekend and

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,330
the other category is a catch-all for

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,340
things like speaker gifts tips for the

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,970
venue staff and other incidentals that

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,620
you are bound to encounter along the way

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,560
finally there's three certainties in

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:46,200
life death taxes and credit card

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,270
processing fees like I said we're still

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,130
working with estimated costs especially

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,360
for the venue for today venue and

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,820
catering for today and we haven't

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,530
calculated those t-shirt sales but we

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,340
have been meticulously tracking every

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,920
cent at this moment we know that pike

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,340
Colorado is in the black and that we've

00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:14,300
netted approximately $12,000

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:16,140
[Applause]

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,680
putting on a conference like this

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,510
requires money that's unavoidable okay

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,610
and the first year's conference biggest

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,010
struggle is that they're starting from

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,680
scratch and have to build up the

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,220
relationships with corporate sponsors to

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,810
make these economics work but money is a

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,570
resource that is only part of the

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,490
equation and it's also I believe tightly

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,740
coupled to the quantitative side of

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,120
operations putting something like this

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,880
on the other resources the other

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,100
resource that conferences need and one

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,760
that I sorry I am gonna get a little

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,740
emotional

00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,450
I forgot the tissues in the war room

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,490
okay the other resource that conference

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,490
need I don't need them Scott I'm good

00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:13,190
it's it I think it's required before

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,190
this concept even exists

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:22,949
I arrived in Denver instead on September

00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:27,959
23rd 2016 which means that my Colorado

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:29,489
status is still at toddler and in fact I

00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,649
didn't even meet Scott and Zoey for

00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:35,339
another year when I was speaking at

00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:38,879
Boulder Python actually the story how I

00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,889
became a co-organizer of Boulder Python

00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,769
is really funny I was standing at the

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:46,249
podium I was introduced by Ian Scott he

00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:48,599
and Scott know I got his last name wrong

00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,669
Ian Scott is here from occipital and I

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:54,089
confused them

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,889
Ian Douglas thank you Ian made an

00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,919
announcement that he was stepping down

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:02,039
Scott was new Zoey was new and they were

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,389
looking for a new organizer and I

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,829
remember standing at the podium in front

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,659
of this very computer with a microphone

00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:09,919
in my hand and I said my favorite movie

00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,919
line of all time I'm your huckleberry

00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:16,349
also I wasn't a stranger to community

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,829
development or even organizing Python

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:18,989
meetups

00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,999
and I wanted that to happen when I

00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:23,550
showed up there that night I didn't know

00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:25,589
who's gonna happen that night but I

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,889
wanted it to

00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,749
I tend if you know me you know I tend to

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,560
bring a lot of ambition and passion to

00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:35,759
anything that I get involved in and a

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,919
friend once told me that I don't know

00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,550
how to have hobby I just I just don't

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,740
know how to hobby it's true I'm either

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:50,399
in a hundred percent or I'm not gonna do

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:52,560
it this is really easy to do like it's

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,389
really easy to go all-in with the Python

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,800
community

00:08:53,389 --> 00:09:00,509
you remember Rachel's talk from earlier

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,639
this community is very beloved Paul and

00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:04,620
Eva and many other reasons along the

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,279
weekend have have shown it stupid

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,290
and told you I but it also opens a lot

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,990
of doors it's given me the chance for

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,129
some incredible experiences and it's

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,779
connected me to people who've become

00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:17,730
close and dear friends that I will keep

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,259
for life

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,869
but I'll be honest with y'all about

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:26,759
something this was this was hard this is

00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:32,059
me on Wednesday right before we stuffed

00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:34,739
all the swag bags I have a really funny

00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:38,339
idea about swag bags that I'll gladly

00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:40,350
tell you later if you want to know there

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,939
is also no picture after the swag bag

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:47,540
stuffing for ferry ferry could recent

00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:51,239
but this isn't this isn't about me this

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:55,040
isn't about me at all it's about the

00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:58,769
team and how we lift each other up a

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,779
year ago organizers OHA Scot and Emily

00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,239
Freeman held a panel on building

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,529
development communities with purpose

00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:08,639
that we presented during Denver startup

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:12,419
week but the picture in this photo is

00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:16,579
actually for March of 2018 it's like a

00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,579
year and a half before this

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:27,230
and a few things have changed along the

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:34,060
way but not one and that was our passion

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,060
for community and how much we care about

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,670
there is no power for change greater

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,970
than a community's covering what it

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,970
cares about

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,410
Pyke Colorado is only possible because a

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,610
lot of incredible people step up to help

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,430
we're gonna honor them with the

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:09,200
tradition I like to call the Brandon

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:12,620
Rhodes arpeggio of applause I learned

PyCon in Portland and here's how it

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:23,570
works okay I'm going to begin reading a

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,930
list of names as soon as I start I want

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,310
you all to start clapping and continue

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,640
clapping until I've gotten through the

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:34,310
entire list if you hear your name I want

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,600
you to stand up and be recognized for

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,370
