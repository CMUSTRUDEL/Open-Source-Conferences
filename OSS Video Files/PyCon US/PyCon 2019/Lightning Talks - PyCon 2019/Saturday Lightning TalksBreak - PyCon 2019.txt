feeling like jogs lightly without

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
endangering themselves that would be

00:00:45,329 --> 00:01:00,059

lots of this conference and indeed of

00:01:47,409 --> 00:02:01,390
history yes so please welcome our first

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,799
sweeper who was bumped from this morning

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,209
but we managed to get him on this

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,569
afternoon Christian please give him a

00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,569
big hand

00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:15,250
okay hello everyone so let's be really

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,200
quick with these things so create your

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,940
first you I would cute foot Python so I

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,470
am currently working as a software

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,060
engineer the cute company so the good

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,680
company is just the company that's

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,140
backing the cute project maybe you have

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,329
heard about it so you can find me there

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,190
and since some people will show me some

00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:33,040
apps so I just wanted to show something

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,350
I'm originally from Chile I am living in

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,810
Germany for a couple of years and now

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:43,150
I'm here so you're saying so M cuties

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,160
are cross-platform c++ framework so for

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,140
you i and many other things in my own

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,780
words i kind of provide things that we

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,549
get for free in Python 2 C++ developers

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,150
so it's really nice for them to that but

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,890
we already have them so C++ is a really

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,900
beautiful language but of course it

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,510
could be also a little bit scary when

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,609
you try to do more advanced things so

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,620
now since last year we are officially

00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:08,350
supporting Python as an official

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,329
language to support cute in general so

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,060
we are adding Python to our ecosystem

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:15,579
and we officially supe release cute for

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,310
Python and the PI's a2 module so how do

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,870
we do it it's really easy so we use

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,880
clank for passing already headers from

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,670
the c++ we have our own binding

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,920
generator tool some type system to

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,319
declare things and play play around with

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,269
the ownership and stuff and then we have

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,630
some C Python code and expose it with

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,570
the

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,580
to module so how do you get it just beep

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,520
installers any other part of module and

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,260
how does it look like so I will not code

00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,360
everything from scratch yes we have we

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,760
have sometimes constrained but the

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,260
structure is really simple so this is

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,090
the final application so I will just

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,830
show you more or less this is the

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,140
structure you declare an application

00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:57,280
over load some widget classes you show

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,620
it and then for the widget class you

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,480
just need to add things around so you

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,710
can start to read some file for example

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,110
and then you create a label a button and

00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,640
then you can connect this button with

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,650
some action so every time you click it

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,950
you are connecting this video slot it's

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,870
not is not realize that a a method in

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,450
the class so here you have a simple

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,850
layout and there is some slot there so

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,230
once you execute this thing you will

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,420
have this amazing graphical user

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,740
application so they can you post it in

00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:32,530
your github and get thousands of stars

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,840
so um just a big thank dr all this

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,210

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:22,699
big hand for Andrew howdy y'all my name

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,590
is Andy Knight I work at precision

lender in Cary North Carolina and today

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm going to give you three quick tips

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,340
for software blogging you may also know

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,410
me as the automation Panda I've been

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,770
writing automation Panda calm as my own

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,180
blog since January 2017 I have over 100

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,160
articles out there and I get about a

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,620
thousand hits a day feel free to check

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,000
it out I'm also on Twitter um I love

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,610
writing I was actually a Creative

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,500
Writing minor in college and so it was

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,820
kind of recently in my software career

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
where I decided hey why don't I write a

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,330
blog and so what I want to do today is

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,040
kind of encourage all of y'all yes you

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,289
can write you should write and here are

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,280
some basic tips for how to get started

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:02,479
if you're not sure how to begin so first

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,979
thing I always recommend to people if

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,229
you think you want to write a blog I

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,729
would say set a purpose there's a big

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,800
difference between somebody saying I

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:13,039
just want to write something and I have

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,080
a purpose for writing something so what

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,300
do you want to blog do you want to blog

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,260
something like personal info or guides

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,300
or tutorials example code is it just

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,770
your own journal or blog or just your

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,349
own little notes you write down to

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,370
yourself is your blog a platform through

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,320
which you want to connect with other

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,240
people or maybe you want that to be your

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,120
electronic business card these are all

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,729
great reasons two reasons I typically

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,740
tell people to avoid would be looking

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,130
for fame and fortune because you're

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,240
probably not gonna find that in a blog

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,639
overall though make sure that whatever

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,260
you write about yourself motivated to

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
write about because you are your biggest

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,280
enemy when it comes to writing and comes

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,960
to write it writer's block so be

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,169
self-motivated set of purpose and keep

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,660
yourself to it the second piece of

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,510
advice I would give is write new and

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,630
helpful content we all know the web has

00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:08,060
way too much information out there so

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,680
don't repeat existing content instead

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,849
make something new make something unique

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,520
a perfect example I think of is oh I

00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:18,830
once wrote a website in Django for my

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,610
wife small businesses and I had to do

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,310
some

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,349
translations in the administration pages

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,599
of Django because my wife needed

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:29,960
somebody to use it who only spoke

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,000
Chinese and so I looked how to do django

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,710
app translations for the admit and I

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,300
couldn't find anything on Google so I

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,490
figured it out I wrote a blog post and

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,439
boom unique content so try to find

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,599
things like that search engines will

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,280
reward you employers will notice you and

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,490
people will ultimately thank you for

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,810
adding something helpful a third thing

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,060
I've learned is that the tools and

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,710
platforms really don't matter I know

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,270
this might sound blasphemous but just

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,740
hear me out when it comes to writing a

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,650
blog you care more about the content

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,879
than technology necessarily so if you

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,800
wanted something simple you could look

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,319
at something like WordPress or Wix if

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,969
you want to make your own kind of thing

00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,000
there's you could build your own Django

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,080
site wagtails app at AWS has a really

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,430
cool thing you can do to string it

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,469
together and throw it out there and

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,060
super fast super quick and super cheap

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,099
I've also have a friend who's

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,250
recommended Hugo and there's also this

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,139
page on the Python wiki that can

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,659
recommend some Python blogging software

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,129
so if you want to learn more about this

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,360
feel free to hit me up on Twitter or

00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,150
through my blog I'd be more than happy

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,039
to talk about things or encourage you

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,409
and real quick if anybody is interested

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,969
in bringing a regional Python conference

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,320
to the Carolinas please let me know

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,380
because we're trying to start that thank

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,380
you

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:54,450
all right next speaker is David here he

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:56,160
goes hey so I might give a big ad hey

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,589
I'm David I'm singing wolf boy on

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,820
Mastodon and I have one weird trick for

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,640
you to make it easier for people to see

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,589
what your name is at lunch I found this

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,040
amazing stock photo image which seemed

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:09,600
perfect for this talk and also hilarious

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
so the problem that you have is when

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,779
you're sitting at the table and your

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,610
lanyard is too long and it falls below

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,350
the table nobody can tell what it says

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,360
so what is the name of this guy I have

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,460
no idea the solution to this problem is

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,100
really easy you just tie a little knot

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,260
in the top of your lanyard and it makes

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,880
it shorter and as a result when you're

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,320
sitting on the table you can see the

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,120
nametag of the person sitting across

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,180
from you that's it that's my entire

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:39,740
lightening talk thank you

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:44,250
[Applause]

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,570
thank you very much in case anyone is

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,560
still here in the morning we didn't get

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,450
through although lightening talk

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,770
speakers from this morning and so as a

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,120
result we had a bit of a scheduling

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,950
snafu with who is going to be on this

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,970
afternoon so I think a few people who

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,500
were promised they could be on this

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,410
morning didn't manage to make it on and

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,720
that is my fault for not talking to my

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,330
co lightning talk host and also my fault

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,290
for kind of you know talking whilst what

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,360
you really wanted to see is the

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,310
lightning talks so I apologize to all of

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,770
you I apologize to anyone even get on I

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,230
am really sorry about that Steve are you

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:21,600
rates talk so give Steve a big big big

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:25,140
big big big big big hat okay X TV is a

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,990
database file based similar to Berkeley

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,360
DB or whatever in process you're using a

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,910
C library so your program is doing the

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,680
lookups so it doesn't have a query

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:39,150
language you're using Python is your

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,920
query language I call the Dex DB not the

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,470
best name ever it's extra features on

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,430
top of LM DB which is a fabulous C

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,070
library very well debug very fast

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,830
LM DB you give it bytes it gives you

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,420
bytes but usually in Python I have a

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,970
Python string and I want a Python

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,940
dictionary or something so I was writing

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,190
a lot of code that looks like this

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,460
encode the key to get bytes get the data

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,880
decompress it convert it from jason or

00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,980
whatever that boilerplate many many

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,320
times don't repeat yourself I said I

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,180
want it to look like this and that is

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,600
what X TV gives you this not that drink

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,600
it in

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,410
xdv has multiple options for marshalling

00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:33,870
Jason message pack you can pack the data

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:35,430
yourself with Python struct back several

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,319
kinds of compression including Z

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,930
standard which came from Facebook and is

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,829
great if you have data like mine many

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,329
many records that are individually small

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:47,550
it works very well for multi process

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:50,430
such as for example a web app running a

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,839
bunch of workers and the next abhi table

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,699
acts a lot like a dict

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,350
except that it can be very large without

00:11:53,699 --> 00:12:01,259
using up your memory here's an example

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,089
of creating a file so we use width

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,910
because we're good we give it the file

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,519
name we give it an identifier and a

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,399
string and a version number I mean and

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,259
on opening a file you tell it what

00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,529
identifier and what version number to

00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,809
check for so if you give it an obsolete

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,059
file or a file from the future it

00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:23,610
doesn't just crash randomly it prints

00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,540
the message hey I expected foo version 1

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,100
and you gave me free version 2 very nice

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,749
you open a table you tell it how you

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,249
want to marshal how you want to compress

00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:36,959
and then you can just start putting data

00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:39,300
in it because there's common structure

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,610
and common metadata associated with this

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,699
instead of just bytes I have some

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,699
standard tools dump out the information

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:51,540
dump out examples of the the data and my

00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:53,910
favorite the rep the ripple is just it

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,589
opens a Python interpreter and preloads

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,990
everything and so you can just

00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,689
immediately start using it and I used

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:04,290
the the xtv shell interpreter to make

00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:06,300
these examples of using it I should say

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,389
I'm using it heavily are you made it to

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,620
solve my own problems and it's working

00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:16,579
great for me so here's an example you

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,199
can put whatever you want into an X DB

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:22,470
namespace or table whatever you want to

00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,480
call it so there's no indexing features

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,540
provided by it but you can write an

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,110
index so I've got this table loci DX as

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,920
an index so using this key system that I

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,459
invented we say in the u.s. in new

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,380
or anything named Long Island and it

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,850
turns out there are about six things

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,320
named Long Island in the state of New

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,600
York

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,589
another example more of a query here is

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,420
a list comprehension that loops over

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,490
country codes to let our country codes

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,560
and makes a list of all the country

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:59,899
codes that happen to also be u.s. state

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,310
codes there are 32 of them I am going to

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,769
be sprinting on adding this to the

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,089
Python package index if you're gonna be

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:10,280
around during the sprints you can look

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:15,120
me up and say hi thank you very much

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:18,689
[Applause]

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,480
thank you Steve our next speaker you may

00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:23,100
remember is Veronica I couldn't bear to

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,930
have cut her off and then not find out

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,749
what is at the end of this talk about

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,370
putting images in your git commits so we

00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:30,839
only ever do this exceptionally but

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,410
there's two more minutes she did

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:40,709
resubmit and follow the process so

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:44,309
please give Veronica a big hand but not

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:46,649
too long of a big hand okay okay so here

00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:49,709
I was I decided that I needed to add

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:52,709
screenshots to my documentation and so I

00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:54,389
came back to bring you all the sequel so

00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:57,300
if you were here this morning but just

00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:00,620
in case you weren't our hero was

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,269
struggling to write commit messages that

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,980
brought to mind the visual changes that

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,970
were being made in her front-end

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,740
projects and so this brought the

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,059
frustration as you're learning both

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,559
design principles and working on your

00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,930
front-end work rolling back those

00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,550
commits on to the right one is really

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,980
difficult and can really mess with your

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:26,309
flow if you're additionally learning it

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,230
I swear I tried everything I could I

00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:30,569
tried to handle one problem at a time

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,429
and I said perhaps since I'm keeping a

00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:36,149
screenshot a folder of screenshots I

00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:37,920
will just refer to that but it wasn't

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,170
connected to any particular commit

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,970
message so I still ran into that commit

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,269
problem I we had before

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,240
once I was within my editor I had some

00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:51,389
help from plugins that allowed me to see

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,579
what colors I was using but that really

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:56,160
didn't solve the problem that I had in

00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:58,050
mind so as I was moving towards a

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,529
solution I said you know maybe this

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:07,709
folder of screenshots could be placed in

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:10,050
side my repo and then linked hmm so I I

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:12,029
did have some problems with this time

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,189
spent taking the screenshot by hand I

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,559
might forget to add that screenshot I

00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:20,189
had used all the tools I could I learned

00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:23,429
about screen shot dipping and talked to

00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,270
some designers and then learned that

00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,220
they had

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:30,089
they get for design and that was amazing

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,220
and eventually got ready to dive in and

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,839
use some of the tools of screen shot

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:40,320
dippings puppeteer and pipat ear and um

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,899
use get hooks to kind of tap puppeteer

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,260
or pipe it's here and one thing I'm

00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:49,680
working on right now is creating a

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,860
terminal prompt to help me save by hand

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,260
and my helpful timer tells me that I am

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,020
out of time so I wanted to share with

00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,350
all of you this information if you want

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,180
to find out more about the tools that I

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,690
use this is the slide to take a picture

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,859
of and I wish all of you a wonderful day

00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:11,769
[Applause]

00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,769
[Music]

00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,900
great thank you so much I'm so glad we

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,060
finally got to the end of that it's so

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,130
nice when you get like a long story and

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,050
you finally get kind of closure at the

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,210
end you know I enjoy that sort of thing

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,210
[Applause]

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:40,260
please give brighto gig hands for his

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:42,120
next talk hey Gary my name is Brian skin

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm a chemical engineer by day and I

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,660
dabble quite a bit in Python on the side

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,210
and for this lightning talk what I want

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,420
to do is give a quick very very quick

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,770
demo of a side project I'm working on

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,550
hard to resist the recursive acronym

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:59,070
pentek's tracks numerical text who has

00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,410
had to work with data in a file or a

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:04,470
string trying to scrape it and getting

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,940
it into a data structure yeah who has

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,190
beaten their head against the wall

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,800
trying to get the data out of that file

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,030
or data structure all right awesome

00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,690
you're in the right place hopefully so

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,320
what I put together

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,300
you know I pull up my Python here so

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,040
this is just a data file it's something

00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,260
that I'm playing with on the side but

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,810
it's got numbers in it there there's

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,700
obviously structure to it but it's all

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,250
one big string if you pulled it into

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,860
Python and you know you can write reg X

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,730
and then proofread your reg X and then

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,530
maintain your reg X and it hurts so this

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:47,270
project pent let me pull in the data

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:47,270
first real quick

00:18:48,860 --> 00:19:00,330
txt read text all right we have data so

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,340
in just a couple of lines I'm gonna take

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,310
this block of data and I'm gonna pull it

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:10,980
into a list pent works around the parser

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:13,560
and this block of data has in there this

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:18,540
block of data has a header to it that

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:20,280
you can specify this way and that you

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,470
know so there's this I'm typing a mini

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,430
language here that I'm not going to

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,140
explain because I don't have time but

00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,750
what I'm doing is I'm laying in the

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:35,370
framework of this data in a way that the

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:38,190
parser will understand it and only take

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:41,250
what I want all right

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:45,510
okay with that so I'm now going to

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:53,340
capture the body of this own data there

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:55,200
it is one line so maybe somebody's done

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,790
this before if they have please tell me

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,250
so I don't have to keep figuring this

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,280
out all this is doing under the hood is

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:08,340
is just generating red X so you don't

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:10,860
have to nice isn't that lovely you yeah

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,190
so you can tweak it if I want to capture

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:17,400
both the leading integer I just make add

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:21,120
one character run it again and I get

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,260
them both so I'm here through the first

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,780
day sprints on Monday if you have any

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,840
questions about it or really what I need

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,220
our people to try it on live data and

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,550
tell me where it doesn't work so that I

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,880
can fix it so that's all I've got

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,650
again the repo is I'm B skin on github

00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,440
BT skin on Twitter if you want to find

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,460
me the documentation is in progress if

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,190
you do install it make sure you install

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,720
- - pre pip install for pre releases

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,250
because it's a pre-release at the moment

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:55,030
thank you very much

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:55,030
[Applause]

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,070
thanks very much having a few AV

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,270
problems on the left with the next

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,340
speaker that's up on this side come and

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,030
start getting ready and I have to do my

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,360
job

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,950
cover up some dead air so you know the

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,179
style of jokes that I like is called a

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,070
shaggy dog story and did you know that

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,380
there is actually an original shaggy dog

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:18,960
story does anyone know the original

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:22,620
shaggy dog story well I'm here to fill

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,570
in the gap in your knowledge everyone so

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,100
there's this boy and he has a dog and

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,110
everyone seems to comment on the fact

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,800
that it's a very shaggy dog and they say

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,730
boy your dog is sure shaggy and so he

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,710
goes you know what I'm gonna do I'm

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,840
gonna enter my dog into the village

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,490
shaggy don't competition and there's a

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,840
number of quite shaggy dogs but it turns

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,309
out the judges decide that his is the

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,170
shadiest he wins the prize and he's like

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,040
well that's amazing and the judges go

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,110
well by the way you know you are

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,290
qualified to and to the regional shaggy

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,429
dog championships he goes oh okay I mean

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,630
I haven't thought about it I won't win

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:54,059
but let's give it a go

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,100
so he takes his dog to the regional

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,260
shaggy dog champ suits has convinced his

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,360
parents to go and go there on a Saturday

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,940
and and and like while there's some

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,770
amazingly shaggy dogs like this thing

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,990
like the shaggy nurse of them and he

00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,429
goes gosh I've never seen dogs have this

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,170
shaggy nurse but fine okay I guess I'm

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:12,330
will give it a go and and you know

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,190
despite the the strength of the

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,230
competition the judges vote his dog is

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,780
the Shaggy's dog in there in the region

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:22,920
and so he wins and that qualifies him

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,330
for the Nationals and so he goes well

00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,040

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,110
just going to be a Saturday or whatever

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,400

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,720
were going to do this with just my my

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,280

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,740
speaker a big hand

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,070
hi everybody

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,680
I'm here to represent pilotis Brazil

00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:00,290
it's my name is Debra Acevedo is my

00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,760
first bike on and I'm really excited to

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:07,100
be here and I'm here because I love to

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,960
spread the word about pi ladies so if

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,480
you want to reach me you can find me at

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,270
right over there these information is

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,430
going to be in the last y2 so I'm here

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,590
to talk about a very nice conference

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:21,230
that we had last year in Brazil for

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,680
women only which was called pi ladies be

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:28,820
archons my ladies we're come first

00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:30,650
thought because we had the fifth fifth

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,740
anniversary of pi ladies Brazil we've

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,750
been there for five years now and we

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,150
thought of this conference to celebrate

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:42,770
the birthday and all our accomplishments

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:46,760
and everything so we had 200 people

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:49,640
enrolled 150 attendees and this event

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,790
was a hundred percent made and attended

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,500
by women we only had women organizing

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,870
and we only had women people who

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,150
identified themselves as women attending

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,610
this event so here we have some pictures

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,740
of the people unfortunately it was a

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,910
morning and afternoon event so some

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,550
people they were in the morning they

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,460
were in the afternoon but it was really

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:13,520
really nice and I want to thank you to

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,620
thank the PSF who helped us to to make

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,110
this happen and also the Brazilian

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,650
Python Association which also supported

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:24,890
us so thank you very much and we've been

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,310
changing this scenario of the Python

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:32,030
conferences in Brazil so we usually had

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:34,730
like a lot more men than we do now so

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,560
one of the biggest things that we did to

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:40,370
make this happen was to start

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,620
crowdfunding to make pi ladies from

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,750
different PI ladies chapters all over

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,990
Brazil to go to this conference because

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:51,190
it usually happens in a city that's far

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,600
from most of the pilotis chapter cities

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,870
so we started doing this crowdfunding

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,180
and it helped us increase a lot of

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,280
number of women not only attendees but

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,360
also speakers people who proposed

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,880
tutorials and ever

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,490
thing so I have some pictures so this

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,210
was by ladies Brazil the representation

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:14,750
of pilots Brazil in the PyCon Brazil

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:17,480
2016 and here we have in 2017 which has

00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,570
already increased and here we have the

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,800
picture of the last Python Python Brazil

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:28,550
the Python Brazil from last year so in

00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,680
pilot is Brazil we have over 30 active

00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,840
groups so I dare to say that pilot is

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,390
Brazil is the biggest pilot is chapter

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,710
of the world it's a really huge number

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:41,930
of actually active groups so we have the

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:45,110
the chapters in the cities but then we

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:47,570
are like this huge sisterhood of the

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:51,530
chapters all together in a unique place

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:54,140
and then well we have 20 registered

00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,210
chapters in the official pilots website

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,180
so we are still working on it to have

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,120
all the chapters like official eyes so

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,430
if you want to know if there is a pilot

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,960
is in your city in Brazil you can go to

00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:11,480
pilotage calm and you find it there our

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,430
telegram group has more than 400 users

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,880
and we use it to communicate informally

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:20,030
we have our Google Groups to talk about

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,780
official things but is it a 100 percent

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,520
success well it's not it's a lot of hard

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,160
work and working with people it's hard

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,470
as it was it was already told here in

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,520
this conference that gets easy people at

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,350
heart so we are working on jack'd so we

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,450
have a lot of things to work on for

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,630
example documenting how to organize a

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:44,120
conference or how to organize pilotis

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,120
brazil calm because what happens in we

00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,070
did pilot is ladies conf last year one

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,370
day before the main conference the the

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:55,280
main conference of - brazil happened so

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,900
we use to do this prior to the main

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,490
conference so we can take advantage of

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,530
the girls who are going to attend the

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,090
conference but it's really hard to

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,040
organize all that how to do a

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:08,600
crowdfunding so you're having some

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,550
trouble to document it and well I wish I

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,430
could see you guys tomorrow in the open

00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,000
space 2 p.m. room 22 to talk about bye

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,950
ladies

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,780
how to keep the community engaged keep

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,000
people doing things to keep them

00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,550
motivated to do things because it's a

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,490
lot of hard work is volunteer work so

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,940
it's really hard and we want to keep it

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,740
active or get it and keep people engaged

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,840
so thank you very much if you have any

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,300
questions you can email me or find me at

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:43,480
Twitter thank you

00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:46,580
[Applause]

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,970
so he takes his dog to the national

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,170
shaggy dog championships and I mean this

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,700
while there's some incredibly shaggy

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,250
dogs here and they line up that this

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,910
sort of top ten the judges inspect them

00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,920
one by one

00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,080
they come up to his dog and they look at

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,990
it feel the shakiness of its or its hair

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,520
and it's a lot of suspense and they

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,140
announce the winners in reverse order

00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,490
obviously he's not number three and he's

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,580
not number two and he goes fine let's go

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,470
home but yeah he wins he wins the

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,000
national shaggy dog championships and

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,510
that qualifies him for the worldwide

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,310
shaggy dog championships I was like this

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,450
is crazy I never thought in my life and

00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,590
his parents like by this stage that I

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,660
could of course of course you know we'll

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,260
pay and they're in there in Uzbekistan

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,640
and so it fly it was beca standard with

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,500
the dog and they ruffle up its hands

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,630
especially so it looks extra shaggy and

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,640
and they get to this like in the

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,260
international worldwide shaggy dog

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,970
competition and like there's some

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,350
incredible dogs here like not only they

00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,850
shaggy but they've got like special

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,780
features this one is curly this one is

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,980
straying anyway and and so you know same

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,930
sort of set up you know he gets up you

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,610
know it's the same sort of setup he the

00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,200
dogs climb up onto various podiums and

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,670
the judges come by and inspect them one

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,530
by one and he's sort of nervous they're

00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,540
sitting there with a shaggy dog the

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,420
judges come over and they they look at

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,420
his dog and they go it's not that shaggy

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:09,020
[Applause]

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,150
are you ready answer need to tell us

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:23,240
about fair OSs please give out to be a

00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:25,610
big hand thanks everybody delighted to

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,460
see you all so I'm here to talk about

00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:31,250
Faro SS which is a new startup that

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,830
we're just getting started up it's a

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,600
public benefit corporation before we get

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:39,470
into that just a couple of moments on

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,900
who I am I am the founding treasurer of

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,030
gnome focus I've been around the PI data

00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,650
type ie Co system for a really long time

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:51,800
and I work at Quon site now and Ferro

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:55,100
assesses R is my next big thing so what

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,600
is Ferro assess so it is a public

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,960
benefit corporation structured around

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,820
fair open source and then the the last s

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,110
can mean one of three things depending

00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,900
on what how you want to look at it so

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:10,570
either society sustainability or

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:13,970
software and really what this means is

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:16,790
or what our goal is rather is to amplify

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,040
the production and maintenance of freely

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,930
shareable intellectual property right so

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,330
we all know that open source software

00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:26,060
has a huge maintenance burden and we're

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:31,070
trying to tackle that in a community

00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:33,050
lead developer owned way and so we're

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,560
trying to set up a system that isn't a

00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:38,390
501 C 3 like Nam focus but instead is

00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:42,710
this public benefit corporation that

00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,850
everyone can be a part of and you know

00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,740
you can think about this kind of

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,330
analogous to other public benefit

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,680
corporations that exist that we all kind

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,440
of know and love like the fair trade

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,850
movement movement or organic

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,600
certification and those kinds of those

00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:58,430
kinds of labeling activities and and so

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,950
there's sort of two sides to this right

00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:03,170
so the one side is you all right that's

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,670
the developers and the creators of the

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,940
open source software or other

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,800
intellectual property and this is where

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,830
your input is really needed on what does

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,530
it mean to be fair and how you want to

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:17,480
participate in with companies in a fair

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,450
way and then the other side is the

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,350
businesses so you know what fair OS us

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,780
will be doing is

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:27,350
we'll be providing certifications that

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:29,570
businesses are adhering to the best

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,419
principles of our ecosystem and our

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,220
communities and there's a number of

00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,169
strategies there but we're in the very

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,110
early stages of just setting this up

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:44,600
we are finally incorporated on Thursday

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:45,890
so that's excellent and one thing I

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,840
think we need to be successful is to

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,120
really connect with communities outside

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,039
of the Python community and outside of

00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,900
the PI data community obviously we want

00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,280
to start here but there's a lot of

00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,380
open-source software out there in the

00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:02,150
world and you know we need more eyes

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,429
than just just ourselves so to that end

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,690
we're developing what we're for a lack

00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:08,059
of a better term right now we're calling

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,039
equity badges so there's obviously a few

00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:12,220
different levels right so you can think

00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:14,240
of this as sort of silver gold platinum

00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,450
we might come up with different names

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,760
but basically what happens is or what we

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,799
envision happening is that Pharaoh SS

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,150
will go out and certify a business that

00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:26,179
they're responsibly and sustainably

00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,640
using open-source in some way and then

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,980
we'll license to them a trademark that

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,409
they can use but then you all will know

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,600
this company is doing open source the

00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,159
right way and they can use that in

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,510
marketing or in recruitment so that's

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,970
kind of the fund rate one of the

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:43,880
fundraising mechanisms that will will

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,030
employ and then we'll use that money

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,059
from the licensing to feed back into the

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,120
maintenance pay for maintainer x' to do

00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:55,669
maintenance and those other activities

00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,210
and so really if if a company is

00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:00,470
successful then the open source projects

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,450
that they're using are also successful

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,630
so we're trying to couple those things a

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,070
little more than they are right now and

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,530
companies that are sort of already

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,909
engaging with us in this process even

00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,179
though we're in a really early stage our

00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:17,030
auto auto ten of ox vertullo Saturn

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:20,960
cloud open teams and of course on site

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:23,480
and / on site futures so thank you all

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,520
we'd love to hear your feedback just I'm

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,159
at scope ATS kind of everywhere or you

00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,659
can email me it's going to be a great

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,659
journey thanks

00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,880
Thank You Anthony can I also get a round

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,350
of applause for the AV technicians who

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,970
like took this failing laptop as an

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,580
absolute challenge they would not give

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,170
up they had won then there were two of

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,450
them they switched it on and off about

00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,580
12 times and it is now finally working

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:55,110
so Joey is gonna be able to give us this

00:33:51,580 --> 00:34:00,880
talk please give him a round of applause

00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:03,700
okay all right so what a fitting

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
introduction this is sort of the premise

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,910
of my talk is kind of easing the

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,020
experience for developers whenever

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:13,210
they're beginning on a project so this

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,550
always comes up at least whenever I'm

00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,290
developing a feature working with some

00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,820
users we always talk about the user

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:23,139
experience this not so much this doesn't

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,490
always often has come up

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:29,260
and so at MailChimp I hear this a lot

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,899
I've heard this every software project

00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,460
I've ever worked on in my entire life

00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,350
and I think I'll always probably hear

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,810
that and I feel like I encountered that

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:39,850
today during my presentation I feel like

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:43,740
every single speaker is had zero issue

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:47,800
and then I come up here and add several

00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:50,560
so at MailChimp we kind of have some

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,020
some Givens basically we sort of have a

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,540
very uniform hardware an OS environment

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:59,230
so we all pretty much have MacBook Pros

00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,580
and then we all mostly run Mac OS some

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,800
people you do have the freedom and

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,540
flexibility to choose Linux if you want

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,340
but a lot of our tooling and a lot of

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,840
our decisions are made under the

00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,580
assumption that our development teams

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,530
will be using this kind of uniform

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,440
environment so we covered those first

00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,220
and then sort of when you choose Linux

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,040
that's a sort of

00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,470
choose-your-own-adventure and then I

00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,670
also tend to support our my Linux users

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,210
at least for the internal products that

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,470
I work for I try to include everybody

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,010
but not every team will have that kind

00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:32,530
of flexibility so this is quite a sort

00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,390
of an engineering message that we carry

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,920
internally at MailChimp and so it's the

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,930
idea of reducing cognitive load as much

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,490
as possible and so again this kind of

00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,840
follows the pattern of having a uniform

00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,730
environment where I don't have to

00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,920
consider every single tiny little edge

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,450
case I can hit sort of the main

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,880
group and then that encompasses

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,290
everything so these are kind of some of

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,420
the things to keep in mind again this is

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,130
a little bit opinionated and given how

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,080
we do things where we are but hopefully

00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,740
you can apply it to your development

00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,540
project and then this is another one so

00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,640
what I'm about to tell you in demo in a

00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,160
second it's not going to be new and

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,750
trendy I'm pretty sure the majority of

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,770
you will maybe roll your eyes or begin

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,260
looking at your phone and scrolling

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,900
through Twitter but that's okay the idea

00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,220
is just to kind of work towards what can

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,250
get us going and what can get us

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,720
developing features in increasing you

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,400
know our user experience and helping

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,300
them and our developer experience by not

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:31,040
overcomplicating so with that we'll go

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:34,520
ahead oops wrong way demo so this would

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,830
be basically just it's a kind of a blank

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,390
empty demo kind of application but

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,580
typically this is sort of what something

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,220
would look like and so you'll notice

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,240
that there's this script directory

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:50,330
hopefully this is big enough I can

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:53,560
increase it oops

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,560
maybe I can't

00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,950
sorry about that there's my history so

00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,520
so I'll try again so here's your

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,280
directory again we have this script

00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,840
directory and so what's in here these

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,580
are all mostly bash scripts that

00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,470
actually run and each one has a very

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,660
clear purpose and these are very

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,790
uniformly named across the company in

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,460
every single project that we have and so

00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,890
when I come into a project all I do is I

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,350
clone the repo out of github and then

00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,300
basically I know that I already have my

00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,610
machine is set with the core things that

00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,210
I need and then I begin running sort of

00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:38,070
like a there's certain scripts so one

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,170
thing that you often do is if you run

00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,550
script help that kind of gives you a

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,350
directory listing of everything that's

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,880
here and what you need to run and so the

00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,830
ones I like to point out is we have a

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,540
script slash bootstrap and so basically

00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,160
you just run this and then in a few

00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,510
minutes later it downloads basically all

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,280
the software all the libraries all the

00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,780
dependencies everything you need it

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,180
checks all of your configuration of

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,560
anything locally installed but we do

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,050
have our development environments for

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,730
the most part in docker and so basically

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,990
it's just making sure your docker

00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,340
environments there there's no kind of

00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,260
special configs and if there is it

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,270
alerts you and then again all of these

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,910
little helpers so when we want to vendor

00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,380
something add it in remove it there's a

00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,600
helper for you so you would just say

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,580
vendor install package name I want to

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,290
remove this package vendor uninstall and

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,690
then it would remove it from the project

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:24,000
and so that's kind of basically it if

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,620
this interests you or anything it's sort

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,980
of a different pattern the more common

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,850
one that you may see is make files

00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,100
there's a lot of reasons why we don't

00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:35,160
use make files internally and I can

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:39,230
discuss that if you if you'd like but

00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,230
there we go thank you very much

00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,220
thank you very much a little bit of

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,330
housekeeping anyone that I was thinking

00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,010
of doing a lightning talk about a

00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,780
conference we actually have a special

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,760
slot for people who want to announce

00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,410
conferences and we basically give

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,390
conference speakers just one minute and

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,010
one slide and we do that on Sunday

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,950
morning so if you'd like to advertise

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:05,500
one of your local conferences or even

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,600
the next PyCon I don't know maybe maybe

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,190
maybe maybe someone wanted Kai's next

00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,540
conference in more than one slide in

00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:16,210
more than one minute but yes please send

00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,380
us your slides and we'll fit a slot for

00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,960
just all the conference announcements

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,430
tomorrow morning on Sunday at what is

00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,410
also a very good slot for lightning

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,340
talks I am certainly looking forward to

00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:30,610
the 8:30 a.m. Sunday lightning talks

00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,840
obsession that I have to share yeah so

00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:39,850
please give I was gonna say Scott yes

00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:42,280
please give Scott a huge hat hey

00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:43,930
everybody my name's Scott Sanderson I'm

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,870
a software engineer working for a

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:50,170
start-up in Boston called quanto p.m.

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:52,660
and that's my day job in my spare time I

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:55,780
often enjoy sort of working on strange

00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,100
unreasonable metaprogramming projects so

00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,920
if you you may remember me from last

00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,530
year I showed you how to take all the

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,770
expressive power of C style for loops

00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,360
and put them in your python class bodies

00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:09,570
and so I was thinking you know what how

00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,770
I could you know what new kinds of

00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,560
expressive power we could add to the

00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,970
Python language and you know I thought

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,610
and thought I had some kind of different

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,780
ideas and then I realized that I was

00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:25,060
really being selfish in how I was trying

00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,470
to add new features to the language you

00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,450
know that's I think that really is

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,370
rooted in the fact that I'm part of the

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,900
millennial generation which if you watch

00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:35,800
any cable news you know is the most

00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,940
selfish generation and I think Python

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,560
unfortunately is language really

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,080
contributes a lot to that selfishness

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,200
because we use the key word self in a

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,260
lot of places you know we have self dot

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:50,500
X self dot why we use self everywhere

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,110
and so I was trying to think of ways how

00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,600
can I make the Python language less

00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:58,110
selfish so this is writing selfless

00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,110
Python

00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,850
and the answer that I came up with is

00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:08,350
this little library so I can do from

00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:10,270
selfless import selfless and when we're

00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,490
self within a selfless society we also

00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,790
don't have classes anymore or at least

00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:22,390
we don't talk about classes explicitly

00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:23,680
so so in our selfless programs what

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,300
we're gonna do is we're going to write

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,500
classes but we're gonna pretend as

00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,150
though they were functions so I'm gonna

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,820
write a function and decorate it with

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,620
selfless and then we're gonna make like

00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,060
a simple like two dimensional vector

00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:39,280
class with the next field in the Y field

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:41,200
so I'm gonna do def Dec 2 X Y we need to

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,450
assign the local variable or the the

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,420
instance variables of our class so we're

00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,580
just gonna do x equals x and y equals y

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,960
and then we should probably put a

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,550
wrapper on our class so we can read it

00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:56,100
nicely so I'm just gonna do def dunder

00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:58,960
wrapper no arguments and we'll return

00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,280
we'll use a fancy new Python feature F

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,020
strings if you're not using up strings

00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:11,440
already they're awesome well the x

00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:14,140
equals x and y equals y and so now if we

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,350
look at my Beck to here you might expect

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:20,230
us to have a function here but in fact

00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:25,090
Beck two is a type so I can do you know

00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:27,550
V equals Beck to construct that and I've

00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:32,560
got a vector here with you know two

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:35,500
fields x and y and of course we can add

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,870
add more methods to our vector class if

00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:42,340
I want to add say like an ADD method to

00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:46,780
this so you know def add XY and we're

00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:50,290
gonna return a new vector like two and

00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,960
we'll do X and we need to get that local

00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:55,600
variable out of our class of course I'm

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,820
sorry this should be another vector so

00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:04,529
we need to get X out of you know not

00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:16,599
self but our vector so do x + BX + y

00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:19,210
plus V dot y now if I do deck 2 1 2 and

00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:22,390
I'm going to V dot add V now I get a new

00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:26,200
vector so this should be like moderately

00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:27,640
concerning to you probably I think but

00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,869
so far we're only reading local

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,059
variables and of course we all know that

00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:34,029
the most important best code uses

00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:35,289
mutable state as much as possible so we

00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:38,049
need to make sure that we can mutate

00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,749
these variables as well so we know we

00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:44,259
can just do that like def set X and

00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:46,480
we'll take like a new X and then it's

00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:48,130
important that mutation of a local

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,989
variable and our function looks the same

00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,420
as mutation of an instance variable of

00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:58,390
the class so we can make that happen so

00:43:52,420 --> 00:44:01,509
I just do x equals new X someone's

00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:06,099
enjoying that and so now I've got my

00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:10,059
vector but I can do V dot set X 10 and

00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:12,339
now my vector is 10 so if you're curious

00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:13,509
or horrified or both by any of this and

00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:15,579
you want to learn about how this works

00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:19,150
this is using a library that I maintain

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:22,359
called code transformer where I've

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,589
implemented this idea there's still you

00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,119
know there's still some kinks to be

00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:27,430
worked out but I think this might be the

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,440
future of a selfless classless Python so

00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:36,870
thank you very much

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:39,220
[Applause]

00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,980
thank you our next speaker is Travis

00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:46,780
Travis are you ready to go take it away

00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:48,820
Travis all right Mike given CAD fest can

00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,630
you hear me is this mic on now all right

00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,040
great I don't know whether to be scared

00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,450
or excited by that was pretty

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,610
interesting I get to talk to a lot of

00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,660
folks at Quon site also who do

00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,220
interesting things but also a little

00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,690
nervous kinds of things there's a lot of

00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,180
things to explore in the world I'm here

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,260
to talk about quonset initiate which is

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:05,140
one of the new things we're doing at

00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,790
Quon site to help companies grow out of

00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,900
open-source really want to help I

00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,600
realize what I want to do when I grow up

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,400
I want to help people build companies I

00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,020
was the founder of anaconda helped

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,460
anaconda grow and now at Quon site we're

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,340
trying to help other companies grow as

00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:20,410
well so we spun out of anaconda we

00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,640
formed one site and we hope to spin out

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,410
multiple companies we're a service

00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,540
organization at heart but we build

00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,790
companies one of the things we're doing

00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,320
is Quan site labs Roth comers just join

00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,940
us as the director and the goal there is

00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,490
to build a group of maintained errs for

00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,380
the numpy ecosystem started an untyped

00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,970
project started the sci-fi project the

00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,560
lots of work in your in the open source

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,240
community but kind of feel a little

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,710
guilty that there's nobody funding this

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
stuff still right there's just a bunch

00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,010
of people out there volunteers wonderful

00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,810
volunteers but nobody's funding it

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,880
primarily so we're working at that fun

00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,740
set Labs will host and hire people to

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,030
work in that in that community excited

00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,040
about that but not gonna talk about that

00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,510
I'm gonna talk about open source TV in

00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,920
the world is the famous quote mind

00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,450
racing Horowitz but it's not just

00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,130
software open source

00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,230
I believe that all software in the

00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,580
future foundation about software will be

00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,500
open source there'll be some proprietary

00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,840
software but the foundation will be open

00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,240
source all the major buzz words all

00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,440
based on open source it's winning and

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,190
there's articles out there to talk about

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,750
why it's winning

00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,460
most of them actually don't recognize

00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,410
that the big reason it's winning is

00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,030
because of the community it's about the

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,400
connectivity it gives us with each other

00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,720
it's about connecting people and that's

00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,710
why it's very similar to businesses

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,110
business are about connecting people

00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,510
also and so quasi initiate is about

00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:30,730
trying to help businesses connect with

00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:33,340
the communities that they're serving and

00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,500
build new profitable explosive

00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,940
businesses around open source I've been

00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,890
involved with open source a long long

00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,420
time some of this has given me some

00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,890
useful information some is things I'm

00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,900
probably need to unlearn but nonetheless

00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:47,050
I've learned a lot about a pro

00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,300
appropriate ways that people can make

00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,470
money inside a commune

00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,870
he's helped those communities and

00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,000
sustain them together so quantity in a

00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,710
shape tune already saved seed fund we

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,970
invest in companies that use and rely

00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,650
heavily on open source software

00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,420
companies of interest it could be

00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,950
anything come inspire me come excite me

00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,480
about something you're working on tools

00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,760
and platforms that improve OSS

00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,800
collaboration disruption so legacy

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,660
software there's much there's a lot of

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,460
out opportunity out there efficiently

00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,070
solve a broad pain point using open

00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,510
source quan site itself is a service

00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,370
organization that spins out companies

00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:19,170
and well we help those as well we have a

00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,780
current portfolio still early stages

00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:24,030
we're just kicking off the ground but

00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,640
saved a ton of oxford tallow anaconda

00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,680
auto auto Saturn Cloud Faro SS these are

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,330
all early-stage companies I'll tell you

00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,790
briefly before I go about one of them

00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,380
really excited about it open teams just

00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,240
started we just hired the CEO of this

00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,310
company she's gonna basically take it

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,320
and make it big and open teams about

00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,850
helping people create share and sustain

00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,640
open source projects

00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:46,950
it connects communities and companies at

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,780
scale on site does that we do it on a

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,340
service basis we do it on a small basis

00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,500
with individuals we can only scale about

00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,420
a hundred people open team is about

00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,520
helping us scale that to millions of

00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,380
people connecting hundreds of thousands

00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,680
of companies that's our goal with open

00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,090
teams connect sign up log in you can

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,250
make a profile for yourself

00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:06,420
a way for you to showcase what you do we

00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,560
want to make sure people get the credit

00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,360
they deserve the open source that

00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,860
contribute to not just a code credit but

00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,480
also the presentation credit to help

00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,130
credit the stackoverflow credit the

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,200
credit all the kinds of contributors

00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,640
that make open source work let's have

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,900
all those folks get the credit they

00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,970
deserved from the communities who want

00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,530
to give it to them and then using that

00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,330
helped them get connected to the

00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,860
companies that want to build with those

00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,780
open source software that they're

00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,890
building so help people get compensated

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,720
for their work showcase their

00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,310
contributions and then help you as a

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,320
company recruit open source contributors

00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,120
as well as build projects around your

00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,560
organization so this is just kicking off

00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,890
its early stages there's something there

00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,390
now

00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,860
be looking for over the next few months

00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,930
there'll be a revamp of the site and

00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,370
it'll be even nicer and even better but

00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,590
a place to kind of show your support and

00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,900
get involved so that's open teams that's

00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,330
Quonset initiate come talk to me love to

00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:56,820
be happy a part of our family thanks

00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:56,820
[Applause]

00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,710
thank you very much

00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:05,380
Rami you wanna do a microphone check

00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:06,420
hello what you rabbit please give Randy

00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,030
a big hand

00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,030
[Applause]

00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:17,590
hello yeah that word all right

00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:20,290
my name is Rami like I said and I'd like

00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:21,609
to talk to you about comments so where

00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,080
sometimes told and I know I've told

00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:24,580
people this in the past that comments

00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,869
are for like the future version of you

00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,880
and that's why you should write them

00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:29,740
I've changed my mind on this a little

00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,930
bit I'm not entirely sure I'm not sure

00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,690
that's entirely true but you should

00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:36,430
write them anyway so the thing is as

00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:38,290
developers we get mixed messages about

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,780
commenting our code you know we're told

00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,690
top sometimes to comment profusely put

00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,340
comments everywhere that way everyone

00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,590
knows what's going on and we're taught

00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,820
other times that actually commenting is

00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,560
redundant and your code should be

00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,420
self-explanatory and people she just

00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:58,780
read the docs if they don't know what it

00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:00,250
does and who has time anyway right well

00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,810
all right who wants to read code like

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,869
that raise your hand if you know exactly

00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,350
what's going on right now yeah I didn't

00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:08,170
think so

00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,880
okay let's refactor it okay let's

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,160
refactor it add some meaningful variable

00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,440
names you know call some methods instead

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,200
of using obscure operators still know

00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,780
what's going on no okay

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,100
how about now I don't know about you I

00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,720
actually find it much easier to

00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,220
understand what's going on now even with

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,760
the harder read version of the code

00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:29,770
because there's context we're all

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,330
problem solvers but to solve problems

00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:35,740
efficiently and effectively you need

00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:36,760
context so also the thing to remember

00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,500
and the thing that I want to remind

00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,630
people is that your primary domain is

00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,280
many other people's secondary domain so

00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,850
if given everyone a chance to look at

00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,170
this code

00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:49,990
raise your hand if you know what's going

00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:54,000
on I see a small number of hands up okay

00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:56,680
how about now you know what's going on

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,390
as good problem solvers we don't just

00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,710
work in isolation we know that our

00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,440
solutions are read much more often than

00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:03,490
they're written and you know a little

00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,810
bit of this let's say you're a data

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,430
scientist and you know one of your

00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:08,530
co-workers who's primarily web developer

00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,300
goes in and has to work on some of your

00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,500
code well this way you can be pretty

00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,760
sure that they're gonna do it right

00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,740
they're not gonna change any of the

00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,720
logic that you worked so hard to perfect

00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:20,080
and they know what's going on in your

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,400
code I don't want to hate on what

00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,500
developers I'm a web developer myself

00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,240
let's say you're a web developer and you

00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,440
say okay I have to help my data

00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,570
scientist Polly expose some

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,990
functionality as a REST API I give them

00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:35,140
this code snippet holiday we're good oh

00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:36,460
how about now see now they make sure

00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,470
that they actually know how to use that

00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,670
code snippet and they're not gonna break

00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:43,930
stuff that you're gonna be called upon

00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:45,280
to fix later comments are good also

00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,290
remember that many other people's

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,910
primary domain is your secondary domain

00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,359
and so you know it kind of goes both

00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,609
ways

00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,520
who who looks at that reacting opponent

00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:56,770
and goes woo I know what's happening

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,210
okay I see a small number of names until

00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:00,670
how do people that's clear as day I

00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,020
personally I still struggle with the

00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:04,330
order of arguments to reduce I

00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,040
frequently forget to put the emulator in

00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:08,970
lots of things I have to look at it to

00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,680
figure out what the hell's going on I

00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:13,570
find this much much easier to understand

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,060
there's comments I know what's going on

00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:18,310
and critically I could make that

00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,599
one-line change that I actually wanted

00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,800
to make without having to remember

00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,970
things like the order of arguments to

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,190
reduce or whether I should use

00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:28,869
you know accumulator concat or not push

00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:30,910
so even future you doesn't remember

00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:32,650
context right so sometimes you're weary

00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:35,050
of over commenting you're in the middle

00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,430
of flow you got your code working you

00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,540
know what's happening the person

00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,890
reviewing your code knows what's

00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,480
happening you put a one-line comment in

00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:43,150
and you call it a day you comment it

00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,380
right you put context in but then six

00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,240
months later someone looks at that code

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,619
and it says were they're having a

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,730
philosophical discussion about the

00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:53,420
meaning of freewill

00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:54,800
oh okay that's what they were doing so

00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,450
this is for tests to make sure we don't

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,370
break our test so now everybody's happy

00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,840
and we still have code coverage and our

00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:03,410
CI passes and github has the little

00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,790
green checkmark so I'm just saying think

00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,280
of other people that might read your

00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,840
code not just future you but if your

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,550
data scientists think of a web developer

00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,200
if you're a web developer think of a

00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:19,450
DevOps person if you're a DevOps person

00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:21,710
Thank You vatta's I anticipate to me and

00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:24,320
you may be surprised by who your

00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:28,850
comments help out even if they're not a

00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:30,500
traditional programming so yep Rami you

00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,060
can find me on the Internet as nekaris

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,930
you can find me in real life by this

00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:38,070
giant purple hat thank you for listening

00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,070
[Applause]

00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:49,120
thanks very much there is a tip for both

00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:51,320
season conference goers and newcomers

00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,060
when you're at lunch and you've lost all

00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,170
your normal friends you could spend a

00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,940
long time trying to find your normal

00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,860
friends or just go and join a table full

00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,570
of random people it's a much better way

00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,130
of meeting people so if you haven't done

00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,390
that people do want you to come and sit

00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,890
at their table interrupt their

00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,360
conversation and hi my name is Eric's

00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:07,520
what are you talking about

00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,960
we're all here to meet new people that

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,820
is that one of the primary purposes of

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,620
the conference so if you're feeling shy

00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:14,330
about that please do that if it hadn't

00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,500
occurred to you please do that join a

00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:17,570
table of people you've never met before

00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:20,360
each lunchtime or whenever you're not

00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,830
with your friends with that said please

00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,010
give our next speaker the biggest hand

00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,010
yet

00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:31,019
okay okay good evening I'm here to

00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:33,059
introduce the Python test runner it's a

00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:35,609
small puff and rapid to all our favorite

00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:37,410
tools that crawls your repo I'm Cooper

00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,969
Lee's I work on those radios at Facebook

00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,729
Facebook connectivity labs there's 60

00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:43,349
gigahertz wireless point-to-point radios

00:54:41,729 --> 00:54:45,209
that can do about 1.8 gigabit per second

00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:46,859
and we had partners that wouldn't run

00:54:45,209 --> 00:54:49,680
our tests so I tried to make it easier

00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:51,359
for them do you want to see I but it

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,940
takes so long to set up do you have

00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,229
multiple projects in one big repo do

00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,910
they all have different testing coverage

00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:59,579
linting and formatting requirements

00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:02,489
if so then PTR or python test run o is

00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:04,680
probably for you also it doesn't tie you

00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:08,400
into github pre hooks so it can run in

00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:11,249
some vendors strange CI environment it

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,069
runs on all modern operating systems and

00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:15,599
lineThe and so what are we actually

00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:17,099
going to be doing so we're going to run

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,099
unit tests we have the ability to

00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:21,329
enforce coverage on per file basis we

00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:23,369
can apply formatting with everyone's

00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:24,660
favorite formatter we can check for lint

00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:26,910
errors and then we also do some static

00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,979
type analysis all their favorite

00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:31,170
projects as you'd expect coverage black

00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:34,140
flake ate my pie Empire which is

00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:36,359
Facebook's a type checker so just go off

00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,920
run pip install PTR and PTR help and

00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,869
away you go but let's have a quick a

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,219
look what the nice thing it does

00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,809
different the tops or any other test

00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,640
runners if you have a mono repo where

00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:46,440
there's a project in a B in C

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,869
directories we will crawl in there and

00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,670
look for a setup dot CFG or a setup PI

00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:52,289
and there'll be a stanza and you set up

00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:54,029
that CFG that will talk take a look in a

00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:57,449
sec or in setup of CFG you'll have a

00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:59,699
stands in the ini file it then also uses

00:55:57,449 --> 00:56:01,670
a sink iota sub process and run them all

00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:04,890
in parallel and you can set that

00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:07,709
parallelism on based on your AWS

00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:10,440
instances or capacity the example set up

00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:11,999
CFG you just have a PTR stanza you said

00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,759
your entry point modules and some other

00:56:11,999 --> 00:56:16,829
if you want to run black myapi etc so if

00:56:14,759 --> 00:56:19,319
you go and look at the CI of PTR itself

00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:21,539
it runs PTR so it's testing meta testing

00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:24,299
inception and it will also run every

00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:27,059
single option then if you want to also

00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:28,829
if you like I am predominately you can

00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:30,690
add a dictionary to setup py and we'll

00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:33,660
pass the ast to pull out that

00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:37,199
configuration and run the CI that you

00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,700
want to do a sample run because I'm

00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,210
scared of live demos basically

00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,920
make a virtual em install PTR and then

00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,010
basically run it from the root of your

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,270
repository it'll crawl and find those

00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:50,369
configured projects and run all the CI

00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,500
that you asked it to otherwise you can

00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:53,970
use the - B option to just run your

00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,260
project while you're working on it so

00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:56,730
you don't run the whole repos and you

00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,859
can use it locally on Mac Windows and

00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,119
Linux I'll be around at the sprints if

00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:03,450
you want to see it I can help plumb it

00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:05,660
up TCI that's PT are available now on pi

00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,660
PI

00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:10,070
[Applause]

00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,460
thanks very much please give all of our

00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:16,380
lightning talk speakers from today from

00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,410
yesterday up from this evening a huge

00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,000
huge fan thanks very much

00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,589
to each and every one of you for coming

00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,820
here for being here for this whole

00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:26,609
conference and specifically for this

00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,770
session that is the end of Pi Khan's

00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,359
talks period for today but there's lots

00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:32,430
more activities as I'm sure you know

00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:35,010
check out the open spaces check out

00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,900
dinners check out after-party events or

00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:39,060
get home early to bed that's one option

00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,410
if you have to come to the lightning

00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,310
talks tomorrow morning there are eight

00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:45,960
thirteen or eight 31 and people who are

00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:48,420
giving talks I should be informed about

00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,660
those shortly and so you have to show up

00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,880
