so this is my first lightning talk I'm

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,919
just waiting for my slice to show up

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,420
over there so my name is Jonathan Biddle

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,900
I lead a team called developer

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,950
acceleration at Wayfarer and today I'm

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,049
going to talk to you about one of the

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,029
ways that we spread best practices

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,609
around Python and Python excellence

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,020
across the company so for those of you

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,060
who aren't familiar with weight fair

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,810
I'll give you just a really brief idea

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,269
of what we do we are a ecommerce website

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,390
that focuses on furniture and home decor

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:37,559
and we're kind of big a little bit we've

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,210
got 14 million products 16 point 4

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,219
million customers which means we're like

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,010
2.4 million products away for literally

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,309
having something for everyone

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,280
and we've also got 2,300 people across

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,649
our various tech teams so what about

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,590
Python at Wayfarer well two years ago I

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,210
was given the opportunity to do what I

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,129
think is probably my favorite job ever

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,670
and it was basically to figure out how

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,589
do we make it intuitive and easy for any

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,610
software team to use Python to solve

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,040
their problems

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,780
and reach their business objectives in

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,479
the form of a Python platform team at

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,760
Wayfarer one of the things that we

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
thought about early on is like ok if

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,030
we're gonna get a bunch of people

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,470
adopting Python how do we make sure they

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,210
adopt Python the right way how do we

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,979
make sure they're using idiomatic Python

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,259
and leading into some of the pythonic

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,810
things that may come naturally to you if

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,079
you'd be doing it for a few years but

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,189
out of the gate are a little mystical

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,340
you don't really understand what

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,450
pythonic means is if we're gonna have a

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,979
bunch of doing this for the first time

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,850
it's kind of important that we have a

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,740
good story here so we could do a lot of

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,149
training and point people to good books

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,470
to read and things like that but we were

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,630
concerned that that wouldn't really take

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,040
in the way we really wanted so what we

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,649
came up with is this model called

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,030
auxilary engineering and what it is it's

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,310
kind of like embedded engineering we go

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,189
when we work with the team on something

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,899
but we have two goals one we want that

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,320
team to be successful we want them to

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,420
reach whatever MVP or a goal that they

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,060
have to achieve some business outcome

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,530
but we also want to transform the team

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,620
in some way we want to bring in those

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,099
best practices

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,900
comes second nature to us you can

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,400
recognize any project that we contribute

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,470
to because we have a little badge and

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,010
readme files for any of these projects

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,239
where we've been involved so let's talk

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,069
about what a NOC sense project looks

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,799
like there's some preparation before I

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,750
even get started one thing that's really

00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,190
important we don't want to force this on

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,450
anyone we want to want to feel like

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,530
there's some like group of experts

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,750
they're gonna come across the company

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,370
and then like say oh no this is how you

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,750
should do it we want teams to come to us

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,159
we want them to feel like whatever we're

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,420
doing is so valuable that they'll kind

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,859
of reach across the company say hey

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,799
could you come and partner with us on

00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:50,410
this we also make sure that we have

00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:52,510
really clear goals we want the software

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,980
team our auxilary engineer and the

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,230
product owner to feel like they are

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,000
aligned on a common outcome that

00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,769
includes business objectives but it also

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,549
might include things like code coverage

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:05,769
or some bring in best practice maybe

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,760
black or automatic limiting pipelines

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,040
things like that we also do three-month

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
durations now yes that conveniently fits

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,819
into like a quarter you know of time

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,079
maybe makes planning easy but there's

00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,060
another reason that we do three months

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,849
there's a research that shows that it

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,069
takes about a bit over two months to

00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,840
form a new habit and that's kind of what

00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,849
we feel like we're doing we're going to

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,829
that team we're working with them and

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,480
we're helping them build good habits and

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,150
if we were to do this for a few weeks

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,459
maybe we'd see some of it but I have

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,049
some concerns that once we leave they're

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,519
just gonna reach for whatever feels most

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,959
obvious to them and those habits really

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,329
aren't gonna take so we spend a lot of

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,489
time just reinforcing and trying to make

00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:49,349
that what second nature to us second

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:52,150
nature to the team so during a project

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,709
it's very important very important that

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,199
we are part of that team not some

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,489
outsider who's kind of like advising it

00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,930
we are in the team we are working

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,239
towards the same goals we sit with the

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,500
team we do meetings with the team we

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,010
want to feel like we are a member of

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,799
that team throughout the project also we

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,449
pair on the hard work we don't take it

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,889
on ourselves that we absolutely do not

00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,959
want to go and solve the hardest problem

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,060
in a project ourselves because that

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,880
Rob's the team of the ability to learn

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,989
that robs them of the chance to

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,140
understand really why a particular

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,490
solution was selected so it's important

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,289
that whenever a hard

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,520
or hard part of the project shows up we

00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,199
pair with them we make sure that we're

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,930
passing that knowledge on to whoever

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,699
else is involved we also focus a lot on

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,150
feedback feedback is very important to

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,979
us so we do weekly retros with the team

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,360
specifically on the aux engine

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,770
engagement what's going well what's not

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,479
going about we talk about the project we

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,479
also talk about our role in the project

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,740
is it is it working is it healthy and we

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,150
want to get like really good feedback we

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,770
actually encourage teens to give us

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,090
critical feedback if something's not

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,000
going right we want to know that we want

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,120
to address it which leads well into like

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,810
the learning aspect of this it really

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,490
goes both ways

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,810
it's not like we're bringing a whole

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,580
bunch of knowledge as experts on to the

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,889
team and taking nothing back ourselves

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,919
we get a lot of really good information

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,169
from this I'm and I I say a lot it is

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,900
impossible for us to know what it's like

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,610
to learn Python for the first time today

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,319
or what it's like to use our platform

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,400
for the first time but when we're

00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,750
sitting with people and we're watching

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,909
them get confused because some

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,630
documentation wasn't clear it's

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:27,819
extremely obvious and we also funnel

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,650
that into 20% time so anyone who's doing

00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,210
auxilary engineering gets one day a week

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,830
to just take all of that information

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,469
they got in the course of the week maybe

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,780
it was something that was unintuitive

00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,159
and an address is completely

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,659
self-directed just take action there's

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,960
no real process to go through just work

00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,550
on improving the platform we follow up

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,159
six months later with the team want to

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,320
make sure that whatever knowledge that

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,150
we brought in actually state and then we

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,240
are seeing that take hold and often case

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,090
that is that's what happens and actually

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,319
even gets a little better than that

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,240
we've done this about ten projects a

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,919
number of them what we've observed is

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,770
not only does that team start to become

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,539
strong but the teams adjacent to them

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,159
start to become strong too they start to

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,770
spread those best practices that we

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,120
tried to spread and they be and this the

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,159
idea of what pythonic is starts to

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,870
replicate across the company and it's

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,370
really quite amazing there's also a

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,020
really high demand for this it's not

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,810
like we have to go and find teams to

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,520
come and like hey would you want to work

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,380
with us on this no we actually have to

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,060
turn away people unfortunately every

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,800
every time we go through a planning

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,270
cycle because there's just not enough

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,740
engineers on the platform team to meet

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,880
that demand so that's a really good

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,880
indicator that what we're doing is

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,319
extremely valuable it's also led to a

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,150
ton of platform

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,650
being with the team seeing what was

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,580
working well and not working well makes

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,960
sure that we are not okay this is Clive

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,979
I wasn't sure if you're Tommy to cut off

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,150
because the time okay so we've made a

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:57,009
ton of platform improvements just

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:59,289
because the you know there's a lot of

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,940
good feedback in that process so my name

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,940
is Jonathan Biddle I work at Wayfarer

00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:10,210
you can find me here and if you want to

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,560
talk to me a recording booth at the job

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,699
fair so thank you judge Shh okay well

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,259
the next person come and sit up over

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:25,180
here number three you know who you are

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:28,210
loading Gmail so our man really wants to

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,800
touch this tractor this is the you know

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,639
the the you know this thing called the

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,020
and the the IMP of the perverse he wants

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,210
to touch it he knows he shouldn't but he

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,879
kind of leans over the velvet ropes and

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,740
he just touches the kind of like that

00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,870
would you call it the little arch over

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,900
the front wheel and he like a little

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,190
shiver goes through him and he looks

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,840
around he's the first person in this

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,370
whole convention right there's no one

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,830
around there's no security guards and

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,650
he's already transgressed so he just

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,110
goes okay well she's unhooks the velvet

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,669
rope it's himself round and gets just a

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,520
little bit closer to this tractor right

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,229
he runs his hand across it walks around

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
the tractor it's incredible right in

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:10,479
this thing is massive it's brand-new

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,210
like the tires are like spotless and he

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,529
feels them and he and he really gets to

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,340
know this tractor on the way around and

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:22,150
as he's walking around he notices that

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:26,469
the front door of the cab is open say

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:29,080
guys like well there's no one here come

00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:31,810
on and and he sort of takes a step and

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,390
he just climbs into this tractor sits in

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,680
it and he goes this feels amazing he sat

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,399
in a few tractors before but nothing

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,539
like this very comfortable cabin is full

00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,950
of all the equipment he's read about

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,390
he's seen a million pictures of what the

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,020
entire row of this this tractors going

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,870
to look like but

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:52,770
being in there is amazing and then he

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,770
sees that the keys are in the ignition

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,750
so he had a little fight with his

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:03,010
conscience but in the end he he can't

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,960
resist and he leans forwards he touches

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,280
the key and he he goes come on I just

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,210
want to hear the engine alright like

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,500
that's that that's that we'll just

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,480
switch it off straight away but I just

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,400
want to hear what it sounds like that's

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,920
what it sounds like so he leans forwards

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,530
and he turns the engine on the engine

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,870
roars alive like gently like modern

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:27,490
higher powerful engines do it's not like

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:30,520
a oh but the power is really evident in

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:34,660
this thing and then he he just loses

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,160
control right like he puts his hand on

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,320
the steering wheel he puts his hand on

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,670
the gear stick puts the clutch down he

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,360
puts it in gear and he takes this

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,550
tractor and he drives it off its podium

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,040
out into the convention hall through the

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,200
velvet ropes crashing through dozens of

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,330
exhibits of monks like several flimsy

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,480
panels he's just going on a mad right to

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,220
rampage laughing maniacally at himself

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,690
like they call in the police they call

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,150
in the National Guard they have to

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,850
eventually stop this tractor they block

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,810
it with an APC they wrestle him out of

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:11,050
the cab they drag him off to jail

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,820
it's quite a scene but not as much of a

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,160
scene that's the one that you're about

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,260
to cause in order to welcome our next

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,440
speaker please give Brienne a huge huge

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,440
Rock

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:28,150
[Applause]

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,850
hi everyone my name is Brianne Kaplan

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:35,140
and I'm the founder of code our dreams

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:37,150
we're a 501 C 3 non-profit in Chicago we

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,180
serve under-resourced high school

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,010
students and teach them computer science

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,620
so they can build applications that

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:48,820
drive positive change in our communities

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:52,030
so I think we can all agree on two

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,790
things this morning number one this is

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:59,170
my dog Piper and we can all agree that

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:01,980
she is super cute but the second thing

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,980
probably more importantly is that

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,230
computational thinking is important

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,560
teachers agree according to a study by

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,840
Ed surge 88 percent of K through 12

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,790
teachers said that computer science is

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,390
crucial to preparing students for the

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:22,180
workforce and as Python II says we know

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,120
that STEM education is more than just

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:28,480
preparing students become scientists

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,700
engineers or mathematicians it's just as

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,650
important as a liberal arts education

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:39,700
but the reality is with the same study

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:42,910
only 20% of students are actually being

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,180
reached so there's a disconnect between

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,790
the belief that computer science is

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:53,760
important and the actual application of

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:58,870
these skills in schools so the problems

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,080
they can be put into four buckets the

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:05,200
first two lack of teachers lack of

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,900
standardized curriculum over half of

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,430
public school districts in the nation

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,040
report struggling to recruit and retain

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,430
certified and effective stem teachers

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,430
and this figure raises to ninety percent

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,760
in districts serving large proportions

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:24,910
of african-american and Hispanic

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,110
students number three and number four

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,000
lack of gear and lack of funding in

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,880
Illinois where I live and where I teach

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,660
it has the most unfair school funding

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,519
system

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,509
the nation according to a study released

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:42,160
by the Education Trust and in this study

00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:46,569
individual schools were underfunded by

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:51,339
2.4 billion dollars so I know you're all

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:54,370
asking what can we do we really need

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:58,720
your help as a community let's invest in

00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:03,459
the schools that have the least and this

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,639
is why I started Kodar dreams as I said

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:09,579
kotor Dreams is a 501c3 nonprofit in

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,040
Chicago every student cohort that we

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:14,110
teach starts with the question what

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,709
communities are you a part of what makes

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:21,329
them great and beautiful but also what

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:24,129
problems do you see our students id8 on

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:26,439
applications they can build that address

00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,180
some of those problems and then that's

00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,970
the applications that they build

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,790
throughout the year-long program they

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,879
learn everything from ideation to user

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,279
experience in design Python programming

00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:44,470
and the delivery of the product to

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,240
showcase to their communities and coming

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,850
this fall we'll have three different

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,910
tracks the data science web development

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,910
and physical computing offer social good

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,709
so there are a few things that we're

00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:03,399
doing that we think are important and

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:05,019
that are different so the first is that

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,920
we think it's important to reach

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:10,600
students where they are nearly all of

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,959
low-performing Chicago high schools are

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,019
on the Southside and sit on or border

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,389
the poorest census tracks however the

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,240
majority of stem programming occurs in

00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,009
the city center which is inaccessible to

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,759
the majority of students who need it the

00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,680
most

00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,000
it's really important that we meet the

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,160
students where they are

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,920
the second is focusing on schools that

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,959
need it the most there's a huge gap

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,500
between resource versus under-resourced

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:44,200
schools so in Chicago where I live

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,680
I can give two examples there's a school

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,930
up north called Stevenson that school

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,060
has an Olympic sized pool an espresso

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:58,199
bar two different gyms and theater

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:02,529
performances versus a school in Waukegan

00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:05,589
which typically has 20 students to just

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:07,089
one computer and their bands plays in

00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:11,290
the hallway because they don't have

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:13,720
enough space the third thing that we

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,730
think is important is exposing students

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,800
to all opportunities intact

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,019
our students have the opportunity to

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,940
take on the roles from product manager

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:26,920
to product designer programmer sales and

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,769
marketing something in there will

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,510
resonate with all students so let's get

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:35,680
together and expose students to

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:37,839
everything within tech and lastly I

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,760
think it's important to empower students

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,649
to actually create the change that they

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,889
seek to see our students build

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:51,519
applications that make positive impact

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:54,610
on their local communities and if you or

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,959
your company is interested in sponsoring

00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:02,199
or donating to 501 C 3 s please give me

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,000
a shout or drop me a business card you

00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:08,589
can visit our website at code our dreams

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,829
org and we'd love to talk to you thank

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,829
you

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,540
thank you so much all next time here in

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:26,200
Griffin my next talk is Daniel please

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:27,970
give him a big hand hi hello hi hi this

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,160
isn't nearly as serious so I apologize

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,839
in advance so I'm from here but really

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,970
from here this is my daughter in

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,980
addition to liking Unicoi she also likes

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,630
Minecraft and I like minecraft which is

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,640
you know I thought that might be worthy

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,920
of study but apparently like that

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,839
doesn't actually work as a thing but in

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,970
the meet but as a result of the research

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,170
I ran into this that I like the idea of

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,050
transforming your world with the power

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,060
of Python that seems like a good idea

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,950
and the way this sort of works in

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:59,350
practice it's for the Java version of

00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:01,570
the thing and there's a you take the

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,850
chat version of the program you embed it

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,339
in a server it exposes a java-based

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,870
stuff plug-in framework it's built for

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,750
the Raspberry Pi version of the game

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:12,309
there's a beautiful Python client that

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,870
some folks from Python UK's printed on

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,270
and got to work really well in the fruit

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,760
in its and it works really well

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,800
I do inject content into the game so my

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,230
problem is that this is mostly one-way

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,880
you know you can put stuff in but what I

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,959
really want to do is I want to be able

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,640
to respond to game events you know

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,780
players move you know blocks change you

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,580
know there's a chicken up here you want

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,720
to do chicken things with it you know

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,730
and anything else that you sort of have

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,220
this this really sort of rich API that

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,350
is actually exposed by the game so I

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,270
figured well let's see if we consider do

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,620
this with some modern Python and it

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,510
turns out there's a thing we can do we

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,460
can write like a web socket adapter use

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,190
that instead of a transport there's this

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,330
beautiful library called Treo WebSockets

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,440
so those folks have been doing a really

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,650
good job in getting an asynchronous

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,630
client that sort of works on that we can

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,220
write something between I mean it's big

00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,450
it's so washer I don't know

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,490
and then you could sort of write on that

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,929
so the scope of the implementation is we

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,520
have to write this java web socket

00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,170
plugin I mean there's others but it's

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,090
like for web things for web people and

00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm not one of those so we need our own

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,059
and what we're really doing is

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,620
serializing and deserializing a bunch of

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:16,030
these these java api things and for the

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,309
sake of actually making it easy to use

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,510
on the same level as my name yeah we

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,820
need a Python module to hide all those

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,240
details so let's say we have something

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,920
that looks kind of like this

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,130
we register a bunch of callbacks we can

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:32,280
set blocks and in this case the idea is

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,540
to respond to a player moving and sort

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,270
of put a block behind them in other

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,320
words Tron so you know you have

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,670
something that sort of looks like this

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,360
you know the game it talks to the server

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:46,800
the server talks to the Python client

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,420
what's the current state this is other

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,560
software development lifecycle is the

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,600
proof of concept stage so it works it

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,040
this actually works the Python client

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,270
considered do that send messages the

00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,760
Java thing can send messages to

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,950
connected clients and so on if this is

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,070
where your nerd is that's where mine is

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:12,270
you know let's chat thank you very much

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:13,530
for your patience all right that is

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,800
definitely the first time I've seen the

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,840
poof of concert emoji proof of concert

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,760
my projects of the proof of concert

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,420
stage the next speaker is hi and please

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,420
give him a huge hat

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,900
good morning everyone I hope boy

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,240
everybody's having a great beginning to

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,860
the third day of the conference so I'm

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,570
gonna talk quickly about PI slackers

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,640
because everybody needs more workspaces

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,070
in their lives slack has an amazing

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,810
workspace switching interface you just

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,400
switch your interfaces and so you should

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,510
all make use of it by joining Pi

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,810
slackers it I'm gonna tell you what that

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:51,710
is in just a minute that's our logo

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,390
it's a slack fur Python it's been around

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,300
for about three years I actually joined

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,640
in December and if anybody here has

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,600
spoken to me at the conference or in any

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,890
other time I participate let's put it

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,910
that way so I joined in December in

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,920
February they were looking for new

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,300
admins and I was nominated and

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,390
maidenhead bin so there's about ten of

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,520
us and that was really cool and I joined

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,950
Pi slackers because you know I do Python

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,720
at work every day but I don't get the

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,460
community like this every day and I

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,100
wanted to find one and I found it on PI

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,540
slackers and it's amazing so some

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,780
information about Pi slackers we have

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,280
twenty 1352 members as of 12:30 last

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,730
night I checked a few minutes ago we

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:37,820
have three more 79 channels we make them

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:40,250
new channels with thoughtfulness

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,410
so we're opens creating new channels but

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,970
we like having a channel used and not

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,230
just channels that aren't used so if

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,710
there's a new channel that we need great

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,480
but if not use one that's it

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,730
90% of the messages are public we tend

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,200
not to use threading like I said slack

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,420
has a great workspace switcher the

00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,740
threading interface not as much but 90%

00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,260
of the messages are public which is

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,260
great but because there's 20,000 of us

00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,180
we don't pay for slack because well that

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,130
would be kind of insane so messages only

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,220
live for about a week so if you're going

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,750
to join check things out it's amazing

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,930
I'll give you a brief moment to just

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,340
look at that that's a sampling of our

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,750
channels if you want to find me any

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,560
other time today and talk about some of

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:24,320
them I'm happy to I'm active on more

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,960
than a few of them and that's great and

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,800
I love it so I'll leave that up for just

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,800
a minute you can peruse

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,360
and that was ten seconds which is plenty

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,610
so join us

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,410
I would love everyone here to join I

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,460
know not a lot of people have heard

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,630
about it even though we have twenty

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,030
thousand users so if you haven't heard

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,740
come check it out we get about 150 new

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,090
users a week because of this

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,590
presentation that I'm giving I would

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,060
love to increase that by an order of

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,070
magnitude this week just so I could say

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,770
how I did that and that's awesome

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,470
in particular if anybody is between UTC

00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,000
plus 7 and plus 14 which is also known

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,410
as minus 10 which I learned last night

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,910
and that's amazing that there are two

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,310
time zones that are both plus and minus

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,680
time zones we don't have as much

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,090
coverage there and we do definitely have

00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,250
users from there that are asking for

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,170
help in their time zone and things are

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,580
quiet so if you know Python if you want

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,030
to help people and you're in those time

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,230
zones

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,360
please join because that would be

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,190
awesome thank you again I'm fine Kirby

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm at miss hop on PI slackers I'm not

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,350
going to give you an email address

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:29,450
because if you want to talk to me you

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:32,090
got to join thank you hi I'm VP are you

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:42,230
ready to go then you first you audience

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:44,180
must give them a big welcome and then a

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,550
community pageant that works for you and

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,920
our actual talk is going to be about

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,870
reinventing the wheel funny thing our

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,640
first title was beyond the wheel and

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,630
then we realized that a better title be

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,550
working brothers so just a little bit

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,080
about how the force before we go like we

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,230
try to address all the packaging needs

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,500
it's going to be a one-stop shop for all

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:10,100
the platforms Windows Mac Linux arm our

00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,350
power 89 in no words so if you have to

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,900
support multiple platforms with a single

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,480
tool and you need a lot of packages only

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,310
kind of Forge is the tool for you what a

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,860
forge is big and it's growing more and

00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,300
more every day like more than a hundred

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,430
and thousand artifacts

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,490
totaling up to more than four hundred

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,650
and fifty gigabytes spread over six

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,750
thousand feedstocks with more than at

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,420
all the maintainer taking care of all

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,909
these packages we have so far more than

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,039
4,000 who request

00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:41,950
and I believe we broke the record and it

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,610
helped for most soup mod the repository

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:48,639
of the most sub modules so but we are

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,289
here to talk about wheels and then I

00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:52,539
would like to introduce you to the press

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:56,590
cutter press is a new tool that converts

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:58,630
corner packages to wheels you can find

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,139
it on the real organization corner press

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,029
it's a pretty new project conduct

00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:06,220
prayers tries to address some problems

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,320
mixing peep in Conda because that

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,279
usually end up with all this a bi

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,950
incompatibility so or go strategies that

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,950
some people may want a package with

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,049
different pills or newer abis then the

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,669
mineral units like for example if you

00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:29,620
wanted tensorflow with different alexei

00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:31,480
ladies lips juicy lip and what i have a

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,940
lot of packages there are not on wheels

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,309
so maybe we can try to port those over

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,860
there as well now because i'm not crazy

00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:42,750
enough to speak foreign language into a

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,429
demo i'm gonna head over to show you

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,870
everybody

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:51,129
let's like get out of presentation mode

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:54,399
here so we're gonna go ahead and build

00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:57,789
up a little Conda index here with Conda

00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:02,429
press so here what we're doing is we're

00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:06,759
going to build a wheel for Python 3.8

00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:09,669
using a condo for just 3.8 package so we

00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:16,450
get we're gonna go ahead and run this

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:19,690
oops sorry timed - P and you can see

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,000
this is actually just contain the the

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,159
actual Conda for - artifact this of the

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,409
tarball and then turning that into a

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,179
wheel without doing a lot of extra

00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:32,860
things right it's not rebuilding that

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:34,240
package what it's doing is hopefully

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,769
will assuming I'm connected to the

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,570
Internet no I'm not connected to the

00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,570
Internet so the Oh No

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:47,240
live demos boo yeah Hey

00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:53,100
okay so let's turn off the Wi-Fi that's

00:25:50,190 --> 00:26:02,220
turned it back on this was literally

00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:05,460
working like a couple seconds ago and I

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:11,190
am going to try hot spotting right down

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:13,460
oh but it looks like we might be back on

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:22,200
PyCon so let's try it again

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:24,120
and yes no yes there we go we're going

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,690
so right now it's converting it's

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,910
converting these things what it's doing

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,100
is it's it's taking all the metadata out

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,930
of those tarballs and repackaging them

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,140
into metadata that wheels understands

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:40,890
moving all the files around such that in

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:45,090
a way that is meaningful oh come on

00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,930
people what's going on why is it uh why

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,520
is it taking so long

00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:56,330
so is the internet really that bad here

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:59,250
yes okay lets us like network here and

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:02,220
do I need two discs and oh yeah let's

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:11,670
connect to my personal one and hopefully

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:17,460
this works come on Faline space because

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:18,840
space needs to be filled so hopefully

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,430
we're on the right network okay it's

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,340
going again hopefully this actually

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:25,340
works and it gets to the next package

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,190
there we go okay it looks like it's

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,570
actually moving now

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,520
so right now what it's doing is it's

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,770
it's it's not it's also walking the

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,120
dependency tree so it's built it's going

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,850
and actually getting the runtime

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,880
libraries and taking the artifacts were

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,050
those runtime libraries building those

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,450
it's doing it right now that's what it's

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,510
doing with Lib GCC you'll see it do open

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,100
SSL in sequel light and end curses and

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,770
all of the things that

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,020
term info and TK and all the things that

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,030
Python depends on because and it only

00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,380
took 30 seconds once the doc once it's

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,210
actually working you see all of the

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,500
wheels for these crazy packages be zip

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:07,320
LZ - we've got a virtual end down here

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,740
so you can see it's clean it's a clean

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,900
virtual em so if you do Python - -

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:17,160
version sorry I don't normally use batch

00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:19,710
right this is this but now because we

00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,780
have these wheels we can point pip to

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,270
the local index directory where things

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:28,080
live tell it not to go use pi PI and

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:30,350
then install this Python 3.8 wheel it'll

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,880
install all those packages as normal

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:35,970
resolve them and now if we go ahead and

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:42,810
we run Python - version bam we have just

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:45,390
pip installed Python 3.8 here this works

00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,430
for all packages if you want make if you

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:51,210
want C make if you want you know GDL or

00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:54,710
other crazy packages yeah this where

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,710
we're come talk to us

00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,880
thank you very much so up next - some

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,960
regional Python conference announcements

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,650
would you like tonight to announce them

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,970
just in case you didn't know in case you

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,560
didn't know in case you didn't know

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,510
there's lots of regional pythons that

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,890
happen as well probably one is happening

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,300
really close to you it's a lot smaller

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,860
than this Python but it should be a lot

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,940
of fun as well so we're gonna do some

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,620
old bunch of regional ones and they're

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,200
gonna announce their dates starting with

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,010
PyCon all right so our usual rule for

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,630
conference announcements is once like

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,790
one minute we got a it's going to be one

00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,460
slide one sentence okay and just make it

00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,230
a really good sentence

00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,280
everyone don't clap between the

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,880
announcements because otherwise it will

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,860
take forever

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,260
everyone please assume your claps are

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,760
there and then go as quickly as you can

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,160
all right clap all the speakers now in

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,050
advance clap all the previous speakers

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,710
clap everyone that's involved in Python

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,900
at any hanaway regional conferences go

00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,580
okay bye consulate will be on Strava we

00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,830
have a PI data track so if you want to

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,020
do data mining in an actual former coal

00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:59,620
mine come to Pike on Caesar

00:29:53,020 --> 00:30:01,450
oh so you have to choose one and only

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,100
one conference don't trust anyone else

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,929
it has to be prolonged in name we have

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,490
the spice girl coming before the before

00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,660
that weekend is in June we have the

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,059
Backstreet Boy afterwards we have

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,800
amazing speakers check the schedule and

00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,240
all the prophets all the prophets from

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,320
the conference are going directly to the

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,340
cpython core developer sprints and oh

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,179
yeah there is also they don't know that

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,059
way but I think it's not the right

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:24,070
audience also if you have to choose only

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:28,420
one conference go to Europe iPhone this

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,770
year it's July 8th to the 14th it's in

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,059
my cell if you have gone to Europe -

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,630
before you know it's an amazing

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:38,950
conference you cannot miss it

00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:42,070
if you like Python in Ohio PI Ohio is in

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,500
this summer the weather will be nicer

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:49,020

take your talks on testing and

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,580
contributing to open source on data vis

00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,620
and Jango when converting a ski into

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,179
Moore's about stock automation and on

00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,860
scientific things have note the packages

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:16,360
you love to use an engineering anecdote

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,679
your teamwork hacks disaster plans and

00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,520
writing Doc's for all that code on what

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,970
to do when all your applications

00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,650
overload in short on topics both complex

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,150
and also Elementary I am the very model

00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,050
