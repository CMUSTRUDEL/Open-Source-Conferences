[Applause]

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:11,790
thank you so thank you everybody for

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,070
being here today the Python education

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,500
summit is one of my favorite events of

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,510
the year because it's the only place all

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,449
year I get to be around a whole bunch of

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,080
people who are just as passionate as me

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,960
about education and Python and that's a

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,869
really special sort of nerd I have to

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,730
say so thank you for making it what it

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,340
is by being here so today we are going

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,829
to be having a conversation together and

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,219
working together on open education

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,590
resources for Python so I wanted to

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,710
really dig into what makes those

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,489
resources work what do we need how can

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,590
we do this differently how can we build

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,039
on what we're doing and because this is

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,370
a Python conference I have put all of

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:10,860
this into a forum the Zen of Python open

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:12,900
education resources so it works all

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,049
right so if it's your thing please tweet

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,090
along part of the theme today is

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,670
bringing together people in the

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,790
technology sector and education sector

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:33,060
so I've put up hashtags that are popular

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:35,759
in tech and in education there we go

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,320
so I want to start out by telling you

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,890
about the best Python open education

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,759
resource I've ever created I used to

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,450
work for a start-up where I was writing

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,110
middle school Python curriculum we had a

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,390
visual interface interface that was in

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,090
the browser students could code in

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,850
Python and very much like scratch they

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,229
would see an animation in the browser

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:11,640
that they could program so we really

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,680
struggled between how do you show guide

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,269
it guide instruction and sub

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,840
Court students versus helping them build

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:21,180
open and a problem-solving skills and we

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,540
struggled with that balance we had some

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,250
great tutorials but we kept hearing from

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,620
teachers students aren't retaining the

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,230
information they aren't able to apply

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,469
the skills so I have this great idea

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,079
they'll go through the tutorial at the

00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,629
end of every lesson they'll complete an

00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:41,489
open-ended project that asked them to

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,420
apply the skills that they just learned

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:48,959
it will be creative it'll be great

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:53,069
so an example of that they were learning

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,129
to program shapes so we took the artwork

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,950
of Alma Thomas as inspiration and we

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:02,489
asked them to look at her artwork and

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,750
create something in that style using

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,840
Python

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,079
I was excited this had everything it was

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,069
open-ended problem-solving it was

00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:14,700
creative and artistic

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,650
it went into expressionist art it was

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,639
bringing forward the work of a black

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,819
woman artist I was so excited it had

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,909
everything but I started going into

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:30,419
classrooms that I realized no one was

00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:33,030
using it they were skipping all of my

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,150
open-ended projects when I asked why the

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,620
teacher said it's too hard the kids

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,949
don't know where to start

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,680
we just we can't do it and I would

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:46,379
always figure out a way that they could

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,900
make it work I would say well have you

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,959
tried all our supports there's code

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,329
comments that you can use as a guide

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,849
there's a project planner that you

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,409
should be using with your kids I had all

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,659
these supports and I could always figure

00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:04,680
out how they must be able to make it

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,829
work well three years later I was

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,840
coaching a teacher in a classroom who

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,150
happened to be using this curriculum and

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,840
they were skipping the open-ended

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,030
projects with some distance I was able

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:26,190
to see that I had missed an opportunity

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:27,430
to make my resource work because it

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,860
didn't work in the

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,080
last room it didn't matter that I could

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,710
make it work it mattered that the

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,320
teachers could make it work because they

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,259
couldn't make it work no students were

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,180
using these amazing projects I still

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,039
think they're great but I missed the

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:51,280
opportunity to have them actually be

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:53,470
used so that brings me to one of my

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,050
biggest mantras that teachers I work

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,289
with will constantly hear me say if it

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,979
doesn't work in the classroom it doesn't

00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,120
work

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:06,400
end of story so we have all these great

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,289
ideas and great interventions for

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,560
computer science teachers but if they

00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:16,570
can't make it work it sits there and it

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:19,389
doesn't get used so how can we make our

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:24,210
open educational resources work instead

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:26,800
of sitting on a metaphorical shelf well

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,789
before we get into that you might be

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,169
asking why am I talking about classrooms

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:34,539
maybe you're when you think of these

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:37,150
resources you're like well they're used

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,680
after school they're used at home for

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,860
our free learning for kids who are

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,409
really interested they're using

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,400
nonprofits those are all great uses and

00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:51,430
that's very valid I want to challenge

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,520
everyone here no matter what area that

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,280
you work in to think about in addition

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,370
to that starting to contribute to

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,789
classroom resources and here's the

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,250
reason there is a movement called CS /

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,099
all this is a movement to include all

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,419
public school students in computer

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:15,340
science education think of this you

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:19,210
might ask why think of this at like

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,250
science we teach every kid basic science

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,500
and then when they get to high school

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,750
they have to take a certain number of

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,430
credits and then if they want to they

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,740
want to go into a stem career they can

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,320
take more advanced courses or more

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,520
specialized courses but we want every

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,919
student to have a basic understanding of

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,350
what is the scientific method how do I

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,260
evaluate things in the real world using

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,860
science that's important to them

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,710
functioning as an adult and this is the

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:56,980
same philosophy that we want them to be

00:06:50,710 --> 00:07:00,330
computationally literate so the gold

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:03,370
standard for this is a required class

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,250
during the regular school day that's not

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,290
happening everywhere and that's okay but

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,690
that's where a lot of places are moving

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:16,000
towards so it's also widening our circle

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,450
of who takes computer science courses

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,150
and who programs this includes lots of

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,970
groups who have been underrepresented in

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,070
the past in programming and that also

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,810
just to point out include students with

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,590
disabilities

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:36,000
so as we're programming I mean as we're

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,710
writing materials we want to think about

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,710
students who are from different cultural

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:45,100
backgrounds than us students who learn

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,860
in a variety of ways there are many

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,700
things to consider and then additionally

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,540
I want you to know that this isn't a

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,760
singular movement it's being adopted in

00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,290
different areas in different ways and

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,120
it's slowly all growing but different

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,420
states and cities may define this

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,500
differently so now that you have a

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,360
background for that I hope that I've

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,620
inspired you to think about the

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,320
classroom as we move forward I also want

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,750
to give us a background of open

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,200
education resources versus open source

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,570
software because I think that many

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,180
people in this room may have worked in

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,539
open source software before but not

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,599
necessarily open education resources

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:40,900
possibly vice-versa so they're similar

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:48,300
in that both resources are meant to be

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:53,620
shared widely used remixed repackage and

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,850
free to everyone for both contributors

00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,519
are very passionate

00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:03,089
about what they do and also in in both

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,160
of them there can be a problem with

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:10,569
borrowing liberally without attribution

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,519
from others though not always so there

00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:14,519
are commonalities some of the

00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:19,209
differences are open-source software

00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,399
really focus is on and again these this

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:24,850
is very general this may not be true of

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:28,680
every project but to be very general on

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:32,290
collaboration programs are living

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,810
projects so they're taking contributions

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,920
from others their projects are changing

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,680
so that's one thing that's happening

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,209
there in open ed resources often you're

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,050
creating a lesson you're creating a

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:49,269
project you create it post it it's done

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,699
and a lot of times that's a single

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:55,209
person working on it it might be a

00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:58,120
teacher who's sharing what they did but

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:00,329
it's not an ongoing collaboration in the

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,000
same way open-source software has been

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:07,600
and so what I would like to do is think

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,310
about taking the principles from each of

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,610
these and how can we bring them together

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:15,370
and work together as technologists and

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:20,680
educators to take the best of both

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:23,290
worlds so to dig into that we're going

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,509
to use a case study from a program I

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:30,790
started last year called Raspberry Pi in

00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:33,329
a box this was through the k-12

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:38,100
education initiative at Cornell Tech

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:41,769
they had a mandate for us who innovate

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,860
and see make computer science education

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:49,209
work in schools and so this was part of

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:52,540
that so the problem we wanted to address

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:55,240
is that everywhere but specifically in

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,250
New York City middle school students

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,269
especially middle school students in

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,630
title one public schools did not have

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:08,170
access the same access to physical

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:10,329
computing like Raspberry Pi Arduino

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,519
all sorts of digital making that

00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:16,589
students in private schools and better

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:20,410
funded schools had the opportunity to do

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:22,660
and so we were like why why does that

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,630
happen well the teachers aren't trained

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,310
it's a big time commitment for this type

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,490
of training um

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,440
the cost is prohibitive because it's not

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,720
just somebody can donate Chromebooks

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,730
it's all the little pieces all the parts

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,779
it's very complicated to manage in the

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,540
classroom but we see that middle

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:49,810
schoolers really need something tangible

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,240
in their computer science classes and it

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,180
also addresses some of the topics that

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,990
are missing in curriculum such as

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,000
networks and computing systems another

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,920
thing that we notice is middle schoolers

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,290
were learning to program in the browser

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,510
and this was building up some

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,240
misconceptions for them so they would

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,420
log in just like they log into an online

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,100
game um and they would make something

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,470
happen

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,620
just like they could do in some other

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,110
type of game or activity and so they

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,290
weren't really understanding how does

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,110
software work with hardware what is

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,790
coding really doing what's a good for in

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,750
the real world that can make a cat move

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:38,430
but what does that mean um so we wanted

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,630
to make this tangible and help students

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:46,149
see computing systems in action

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,760
our solution was a one to one raspberry

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:52,300
pie program what that means is we

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,360
envisioned incoming sixth graders

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,240
receiving their own raspberry pie these

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,510
raspberry pies would live at the school

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,459
but by the end of their middle school

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,190
years when they graduated eighth grade

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:09,610
they would take home with them a working

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:13,600
computer full of a portfolio of their

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:16,029
computer science work in addition to

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,620
that so it also addressed students who

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:22,540
didn't have access to computers and

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,170
portfolios for getting into high school

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,850
etc our goal was to keep the cost as low

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,639
as possible low enough that a teacher

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,939
could go on to DonorsChoose and raise

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,249
enough money we wanted everything ready

00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,709
to go here's how you set up here's what

00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:42,579
you buy here's the curriculum that you

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:45,309
can choose from we wanted to start to

00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:48,819
move kids out of scratch by eighth grade

00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:50,769
start to move them into Python and we

00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:53,170
wanted subject area integration so they

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:58,329
had time during the school day to do the

00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:02,350
work so this is our big idea well what

00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:04,809
did we learn from this idea this is the

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,050
first thing we learned this is this is a

00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:10,420
slide from the official Raspberry Pi

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,600
foundation teacher training called Pike

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:17,079
Adam II um so this is really part of

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,439
raspberry PI's ethos is that first

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:24,279
attempted learning or failure is common

00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:28,779
and desirable it's part of the learning

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:31,449
process and as experience educators we

00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:35,319
thought that shouldn't be part of our

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:37,980
process but if you're dealing with a

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:41,379
Raspberry Pi if you're dealing with

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,959
people students and classrooms this will

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,389
be part of the experience and that's a

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:51,279
good thing just like it is if you're a

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:54,939
student using the Raspberry Pi so what

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,870
bumps did we encounter the first was in

00:14:54,939 --> 00:15:01,360
curriculum I want to thank shantel Mason

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,980
you can tweet her she is the one who

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,670
developed all of our open-source

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:10,149
curriculum so she learned some things

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,439
teachers weren't able to take what they

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,929
saw in the internet there's all these

00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,269
projects for Raspberry Pi right there's

00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:19,120
endless education resources teachers

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,069
weren't able to take that and then make

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,029
it into something that they knew what to

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,679
do with in the classroom they were

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:30,399
unable to do that because they needed a

00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:33,630
format that fit into their schema for

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,350
like what education is so

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:41,550
we formatted our lessons to look similar

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:45,030
to what they might see if they planned a

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,020
unit or a lesson plan it's a little bit

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,510
different because it needs to be

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,670
flexible for everybody but we wanted to

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,830
queue some of the things that they would

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,290
recognize so that they knew what to do

00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:58,110
with the information um

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:01,550
next we did not reinvent the wheel we

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,500
relied heavily on raspberry PI's open

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,560
education resources and we use that as

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:12,780
the foundation and then we built on top

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:17,940
of that and finally Chantal really dug

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:20,250
into the standards you know a lot of us

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,720
want to approach it as oh here's what I

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,780
wish I would have learned here's

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,000
something really interesting but Chantal

00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:31,320
started with what do the teachers need

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,140
to teach and can I understand where the

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,530
kids are actually at and she was able to

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,920
really dig in and because of that she

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:45,060
created subject integrated lesson plans

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,660
so for example in science class they

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,610
study urban farms and they make an urban

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,420
farm and monitor it with a raspberry pie

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:59,970
in English language arts they are

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:03,390
studying propaganda and so they read a

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,329
book and they create a series of

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:09,959
podcasts that are presented in a

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:13,020
raspberry pie radio project and this is

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:18,270
part of their assessment for their ela

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:20,760
class so once that was pretty easy to

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:24,209
overcome once we recognize the problems

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,250
we could address them and we're able to

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,060
come up with good curriculum solutions

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:35,760
on the other hand peripherals and

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:39,540
networking I would say that there are

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,670
perhaps no great choices in this area um

00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:45,090
we still have not solved this problem

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,590
this one's ongoing the first thing that

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,809
I learned is to

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,740
be really clear about your program goals

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,929
and base the choices for this on those

00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:00,570
goals so for us

00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:04,590
we chose we did not want to use laptops

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,779
and SSH n because we wanted kids to have

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,210
the tangible hardware software

00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:15,539
experience we want them using the PI and

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:19,080
seeing the PI we ended up using PI tops

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:22,230
which kind of obscured our goal of using

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,119
and seeing the PI on the other hand it

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,149
solves some of the school's problems

00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:33,059
which where where are we going to put 30

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:34,769
more monitors in our school so there are

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,749
several options we haven't found

00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:40,769
something that works for both the school

00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:43,769
and the students yet we're working on it

00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:46,440
and we also learn no it's not just us

00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,789
every time we hit a bump in the road we

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,070
thought oh we just can't use the

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,470
Raspberry Pi that well we must not know

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,049
exactly what we're doing but what we

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:59,039
actually found out was that with certain

00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:01,200
products there were user design issues

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,320
that were causing these problems on a

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,999
wider scale and it was important for

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,710
those companies that we went to them and

00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:10,230
told them what was happening in the

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,389
classroom because to go back if it

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:18,749
doesn't work in the classroom it doesn't

00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:21,600
work this doesn't apply to most open

00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:24,029
education resource projects but I just

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,539
want to touch on it because there are

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:30,419
some programs that are open scheduling

00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:33,990
and budget are big obstacles in schools

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,840
if you are creating some kind of open

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,570
education resource just because what you

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,869
created is free does not mean it's free

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,049
to implement in this school so thinking

00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:48,480
about what are the costs a lot of times

00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:52,830
there are cost trade-offs schools can

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,779
work harder to have something for free

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,809
or pay less money but they may need more

00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,650
in-house expertise than they have so

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,780
again

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,660
and you might have a solution that works

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,460
for you but it's not gonna work within

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,740
the school day for the teachers who were

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,530
there so just something to think about

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,420
oh and we also found it was great for

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,610
teachers more than one teacher to do

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,480
this to have a cohort that's in it

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:20,100
together at the school

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,950
lastly we found teacher training is

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,710
important nobody was going to use our

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,170
curriculum unless we could figure out

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,000
some type of training because we want

00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,140
this to be a program that's accessible

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,660
and ready to go

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,580
we're looking at what is the least

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,620
amount of training what is the most

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,230
accessible way for them to get the

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,030
training we cannot send every middle

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,080
school teacher in New York City to Pi

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:49,050
Academy so how can we give them enough

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,430
training to implement this program so

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,490
that their students can have the

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,800
physical computing experiences we're

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,140
looking at lots of different options can

00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,230
we get it down to a one-day thing that's

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,030
offered throughout the boroughs can we

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,300
do it online can we use some of

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:10,040
raspberry PI's online resources so this

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:13,710
is an area we are also still exploring

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,530
we've also realized teachers need to do

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:20,450
the projects they need to play and they

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:24,530
need to master the materials many

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,270
computer science educators are new

00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,520
they're new to computer science even at

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,490
the high school level and they are

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,590
learning along with their students so in

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,480
our trainings we really focus on them

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:42,120
building confidence and building their

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:44,310
skills so moving forward we did learn

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,280
that students can do this despite all

00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:50,580
the bumps and obstacles and teachers

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,740
without the official training can do

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,510
this we have subject area middle school

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,090
teachers who've never touched code

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,780
before having their kids use Raspberry

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,240
Pi with Python to build these projects

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:06,140
so they can do it and they enjoy it and

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,910
that told us that it's worth dealing

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,410
with all those failures that come up

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,480
it's worth dealing with the bumps

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,030
because the kids get a Next

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,780
Ariane's that they would not get with an

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:22,049
online tutorial which for them was the

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,700
alternative and iteration is really key

00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:28,850
you just have to keep trying and keep

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,530
addressing problems as they come up so I

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,710
want to break this apart and abstract it

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:37,530
out a little bit and think about some

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:42,270
principles that we can apply to every

00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:44,929
open source education project so the

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:48,419
first concept is that content matters

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:50,850
but not at the expense of logistics what

00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,290
does that mean I'm not saying like

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,450
forget about the content it doesn't

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:58,080
matter I'm saying if you have the

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:00,320
greatest content in the world if schools

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:06,720
can't figure out how to implement it

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:08,669
students won't get to use it next you

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,400
should never assume that your user looks

00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,320
like you or thinks like you refuse a

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:18,960
temptation to design for your younger

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:22,410
self access counts it is so easy as an

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,309
educator for me to think about myself

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,640
when I was in seventh grade how did I

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:32,940
learn what would have been fun for me

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:37,580
that does not work every educator learns

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:40,320
pretty quickly it's very tempting so

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,590
user centered design thinking about your

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,070
audience and what will work for them and

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,830
most of them are learning programming in

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,429
a sort of non-traditional environment

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,809
the traditional way of learning Python

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:57,809
which is what i did i went online by

00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:59,940
myself i Eilert I used I worked through

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,940
learn Python the hard way and I was off

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:06,510
and running that's not going to work for

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:11,429
our students in classrooms of 30 people

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:15,000
each with no background access counts

00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:19,470
that means two things that means access

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,640
to the curriculum for students with

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,250
disabilities but it also means

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,100
to think about what access they have to

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:32,470
technology don't assume every student

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,380
has a computer how else can they program

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:39,170
there are actually it's not ideal but

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:42,620
there are apps for programming Python on

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:45,260
your phone on a tablet in the browser

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,110
there's all sorts of options so think

00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:51,520
about alternatives and don't assume that

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:54,620
kids have access to these tools just

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:59,000
accept that you're a you're a UX

00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:03,970
designer I'm sorry but you have to be if

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,000
you have a blank white page full of text

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:10,040
filling the page that's not gonna work a

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,669
teacher's not gonna know what to do with

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,730
that or how to pick it apart so if you

00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:20,510
want your projects to be used you want

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,160
to think about design and then testing

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,500
in an education environment is better

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,460
than having a kid related to you test it

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,220
if you're fourth grader can do it

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:35,299
doesn't matter can a fourth grade class

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,919
do it why don't you go try go see and we

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,780
can talk about different ways how you

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,169
can build relationships with schools to

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:45,049
do this testing um if there are too many

00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:48,770
Python in jokes it's probably a bad idea

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:51,760
because they exclude new users if you

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,200
think it's too obvious to explain um

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,980
but explain it anyway it's probably a

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,750
good idea because it wasn't obvious and

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,350
your contributors need guidance

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,980
especially in these areas so I love

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:09,950
Python in jokes but my students don't

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:13,340
they really don't get Monty Python I

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:18,080
wish they did and they really don't care

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:20,240
once I explain it to them so when

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,000
students and teachers read that they

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,370
feel like outsiders because that's

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,790
another thing other than the content

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:30,380
that they need to decode and figure out

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:34,520
so we want to be welcoming with the

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,500
materials also if you think it's obvious

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,960
if you think you want

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,360
all the way back to the very beginning

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,910
stop and go three steps before that just

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,800
they don't know and a lot of teachers

00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,980
even high school computer science

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,040
teachers have never used get and you've

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:56,240
got a project up on get that is amazing

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,980
and they don't know how to use it so

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,950
these are just some things to think

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,740
about to make sure that your projects

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,990
work and letting your contributors know

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,770
giving them some guidance so that you're

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,990
not alone in making it work

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:15,440
and again if it doesn't work for the

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:19,130
intended user it doesn't work you will

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:24,560
fail and it will still be worth it this

00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:26,240
work is so important we have a huge need

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,070
right now in computer science education

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,970
for projects for collaboration between

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:36,770
educators and people in technology there

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,040
is a lot of curriculum out there but

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:42,050
it's not all great and your contribution

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,970
can make a huge difference so even if

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,960
you make some of these mistakes it is

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,960
still worth it

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:53,330
finally resources that exist are better

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,790
than resources that don't so please if

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,850
you have an idea do it even if it's not

00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:01,280
perfect resources that can be found are

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,920
better than resources that can't if you

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,510
have an idea and you do it how will you

00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,690
get it out to teachers how will they

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:11,390
find you resources that can be found and

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:16,550
used by your target user are even better

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:19,520
so let's do more of that so I present

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,360
you the Zen of Python open education

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,360
resources

00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:33,649
sorry say yeah write it down quickly

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:45,779
I'll also go back I could go back to it

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:48,149
during the Q&A okay so what are four

00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:52,590
takeaways that you can use to day during

00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:55,349
your sprints first think about how you

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,059
can create templates or guidelines for

00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:59,729
your contributors how can you educate

00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,799
them in this area so that you can bring

00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:03,450
in the widest amount of contributors and

00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,539
they can contribute in a meaningful way

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:11,519
how can you give them guidance one idea

00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:14,479
I have for my project is to make to use

00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,340
github pages to create a template and

00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:19,919
let contributors know that they should

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:24,389
use the template to submit their

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:28,559
projects for our for our open source

00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:30,929
project next bring on educator advisors

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,049
or if you're primarily a group of

00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:36,179
educators bring on advisors who are

00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,700
Python developers who are in the

00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:43,139
industry if you're primarily in

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,809
technology bring on educators let's work

00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,940
together next let's start turning these

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,840
educational materials into living

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,720
documents they are anyway teachers

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,369
virtually cannot take something off the

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,289
internet and then just turn it around

00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:01,049
and use it at face value in class

00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:03,960
they're already having to make changes

00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:08,759
so let's make that part of our culture

00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:12,119
let's let's start you know taking pull

00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:16,619
requests let's start making things live

00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:19,470
and taking contributions and then next

00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:21,450
whenever you can test in a classroom so

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,649
if you can plan for that during your

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,649
sprint that's great

00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:30,570
so that is it thank you for listening

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,639
today please contact me and keep the

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,070
conversation going

00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:37,919
I did write a book this year if you're

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,270
interested it's there if you're not no

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,200
big deal

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:46,260
I would love to take questions I'm just

00:30:43,200 --> 00:31:19,070
gonna flip back here since everyone

00:30:46,260 --> 00:31:21,930
wanted that one yeah yeah sure so

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:26,220
actually it's much easier to use scratch

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:28,260
because scratch is available in so many

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,680
different languages there's a drop down

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,180
of like 40 languages you can pick and it

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,710
switches the blocks to that language

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,690
Python doesn't have that we don't even

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,940
have documentation and a lot of

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:45,960
languages let alone documentation for a

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,620
middle school student so a lot of times

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,270
we are differentiating with scratch

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,860
another thing is we use an approach

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:57,150
called translanguaging and also pairing

00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,790
that with something a literate

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,340
programming so an example of literate

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:05,250
programming is where a student might

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,890
describe what they want to do and start

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:13,530
to they might ask a question like how

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:16,140
can I tell a story about you know X with

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,550
Python and then they might start writing

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,980
it

00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,230
they might cert write how writing how

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,660
they're doing it then they gradually

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:28,950
start writing it in what they think is

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:30,450
pseudocode or in pseudocode in using

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,250
commands that they think might be in

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,490
Python it's okay if the command doesn't

00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:37,470
actually exist then we take that and we

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,150
look at those commands even if they

00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,530
don't exist then we talk about that we

00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,000
talk about what could that be

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:47,730
in Python there's some great people

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Chris home Lee and Sarah Vogel at CUNY

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:53,340
and Columbia who are doing research on

00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,500
teaching computer science to suit

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,690
to English language learners and they're

00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,850
doing this research and have shared it

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,700
with us and so that's my source on that

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:05,669
and I'd also love to learn from you

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:35,250
since you've been doing it with kids in

00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:39,090
the field I will yes yeah

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,340
that's a great question um you know it

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,669
is hard there's lots of solutions online

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,820
there's not a lot of research that to

00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:50,580
show us what actually works but there

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,470
are a lot of attempts at solutions so

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,269
one of those is the company that I used

00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,059
to work for code stirs that lets you

00:33:54,269 --> 00:34:00,450
drag a block over it turns the block

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:02,880
into Python once you drop it in and then

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:09,510
it asks the students to modify the

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:12,480
Python that uses an approach that uses

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,879
an approach that's called use remix

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,710
create that is research-based in

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,869
computer education computer science

00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,669
education but we don't know that that

00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:23,460
actually works for transitioning

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:28,649
students you know trinket has the Python

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:31,500
blocks and then Python we don't know if

00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:33,300
it works it's it's worth a try but also

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,970
I just think finding something that's

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,480
motivating and interesting for the

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:40,919
students and especially because he's not

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,389
in a classroom you know he's working

00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:45,379
with you something that's personally

00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:50,030
motivating a project he wants to do to

00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:50,030
figure start figuring out Python

00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,420
yeah I thought it was just middle school

00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:07,160
students and elementary that it the

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,760
hardware made a difference for micro

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:13,520
bits and Raspberry Pi but I actually

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,220
when I go to 6e the special interest

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,700
group on education of the ACM every year

00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,890
I hear graduate professors talking about

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,299
how crazy their students went for

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,030
raspberry PI's because there was

00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:27,859
something magical about holding it and

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,380
touching it and improved their pass

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:57,980
rates so it's not just young kids it's

00:35:30,380 --> 00:36:00,170
everybody I have found that school

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,619
librarians are often on the forefront of

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:06,530
this type of work and not just computer

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:09,859
science but especially digital making I

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,900
mean just librarians have a history of

00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:14,240
leading the maker movement in this

00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,650
country so I don't see why they should

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,819
be leading it in schools also oftentimes

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,150
administrators feel that that's a good

00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:24,980
place for their digital resources to fit

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,380
in the librarians already managing a

00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,030
bunch of digital subscriptions and

00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,750
things like that so we have school

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:34,880
librarians also managing all the robots

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,940
and being the expert on the different

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,859
robots and having students come in and

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,950
then the library becomes the place where

00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:45,650
they can come to figure things out and

00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,200
to get kind of extra help outside of

00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,059
their computer science class I don't

00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,569
know if that answers your question

00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:52,569
great

00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,840
yes

00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:55,130
absolutely you hit the nail on the head

00:37:53,509 --> 00:38:01,970
that is the tension that will always

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:04,640
exist and it is so true what you said so

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:06,980
first I just want to point out that by

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,400
starting to incorporate computer science

00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:13,970
education during the school day at every

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,970
grade level we are already making we are

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:19,789
already part of one of the most massive

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:24,259
systemic changes in public school

00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:27,680
education in the last century so that's

00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:30,009
a big deal and that's a huge amount of

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,710
change for our public school system

00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:38,499
because as you were saying change is not

00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:40,759
easy and the culture is not set up for

00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:42,230
innovation and learning through failure

00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:48,289
and building and making and

00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:50,809
experimenting so that's it there's a

00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:55,940
couple different approaches that I take

00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:58,460
one as a coach I try to create that

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:02,690
space I let administrators know this is

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:06,109
not a tested area so this won't be part

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:09,849
of the evaluation of the teacher the

00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:12,410
other thing is that we find that as we

00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:15,619
train computer science teachers to have

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:18,650
this mindset it is starting to become

00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:22,400
contagious in the rest of the school so

00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:24,559
I'll see a ninth grade classroom that is

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,329
it's a computer science classroom and

00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,980
the other teachers in the school all

00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:31,039
know that that's where the kids go to

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:34,460
learn how to use resources how to

00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,079
problem-solve independently and it's

00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,900
they've sort of discovered that that

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,980
teacher is helping them with all of

00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,910
their work because of the open

00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,289
problem-solving that's happening that

00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:49,059
wouldn't normally happen in the other

00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:51,559
rooms in a kindergarten class I was in

00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:53,960
last year the teacher said to me

00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:56,630
this is the only place the students get

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,070
to practice cutting they didn't know how

00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,800
to use scissors they

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,780
did practice and I said if that's what

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,750
that's a great use of computer science

00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,200
time let's keep doing that so I think

00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,550
individual teachers are making change

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,700
you know as they're creating this

00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:15,860
environment within their classrooms and

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,560
to some degree because it's still not

00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:21,410
tested you know we have some protection

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:55,220
for that we'll see what happens in the

00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:57,140
future pair programming does there's

00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,120
research there's a lot of research to

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,560
back that up pair programming does

00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,530
improve performance and improve

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,410
participation from girls specifically

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:13,790
flipped classrooms the jury's out that

00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:18,140
can create an access issue it works

00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:20,990
often in maybe a middle class school

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,630
environment it doesn't work all the time

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:26,300
for everybody so it just depends on the

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:30,260
learners but I would say the jury is

00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,490
kind of out on that thinking about

00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:36,440
children where they are developmentally

00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:38,540
is very important I kind of rearranged

00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,850
the way that I teach Python to them I

00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:44,660
start I think about math and math we do

00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:47,090
concrete representational abstract and I

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:51,830
use the same principles for Python how

00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:54,820
can we start with objects both objects

00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:58,670
as a programming construct and literal

00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,790
manipulatives objects and how do we move

00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:04,850
and build from there

00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:06,440
so with Python we often actually start

00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,450
with something a little more advanced an

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,650
object sometimes a spray if we're using

00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:14,750
pygame or something similar

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:20,410
and then go from there rather than just

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,410
starting with numbers strings etc I

00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,500
personally don't I at Cornell Tech I

00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,670
work with some graduate students who are

00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:40,700
trying to and it's been really difficult

00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,950
it's difficult to teach to teachers and

00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,830
it's more difficult to teach to students

00:42:42,950 --> 00:43:04,040
it's a great problem for us to work on

00:42:45,830 --> 00:43:06,760
and solve together yeah so in many

00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,900
places there is a university that's

00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:16,340
facilitating computer science work in

00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:20,570
k-12 so that's a good place to start

00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:22,880
trying to find who are the people in my

00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,730
area that are maybe researching CS

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,800
education there's often somebody in a C

00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:30,620
as a department or an education

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,980
department who's doing that and they're

00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,800
often looking for practitioners people

00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,890
who want to be part of that and do

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,350
related work so that's one way I don't

00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:46,070
think there's an easy answer to this

00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:51,610
because again it's a big unsolved

00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:55,940
problem I've had I actually met somebody

00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:58,670
at PI Gotham years ago he said I'm

00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,310
really excited I want I want to do this

00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,990
and I said okay just you know get to

00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,670
know a teacher and go do it a year later

00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,040
he was like I've been working in a

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,590
classroom for a year with the teacher

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,660
just has a volunteer on his own I think

00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,840
that's really rare

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:18,080
there are programs let volunteer

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,090
programs like teals which is a national

00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,770
program where software engineers can

00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,600
volunteer in the classroom and work

00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,640
directly with teachers

00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,410
and I think that's a good place to start

00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,150
and then you build the relationship with

00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,780
the teacher maybe they want to continue

00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,580
work together and contribute something

00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,740
maybe you could do a small project just

00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,350
by if you have a child approaching their

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,790
teacher hey can we try this in your

00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,890
classroom

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,290
so there's different options I don't

00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,230
think there's a ready solution yet but

00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,880
if you have initiative and you want to

00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,460
start building those bridges it's a

00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,450
great idea uh one more thing could be

00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:59,210
going to educator Technology educator

00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:21,410
meetups in your area and asking who's

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:24,110
interested yeah yes she just said public

00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:27,650
school public libraries have a good in

00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:31,210
with many public school systems thank

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,210
you yes

00:45:43,410 --> 00:46:01,890
okay yes so specifically for students

00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:05,319
who are blind or low vision there is a

00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:08,099
learning language called quorum that is

00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:13,200
made specifically for those students

00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:17,380
also I would direct you for students who

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,109
who are deaf deaf kids code is an

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,729
organization that focuses on that access

00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:24,880
computing out of the University of

00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:28,900
Washington focuses on accessibility and

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,339
CS education but primarily students who

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,239
are blind or low vision or have a

00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:36,460
physical disability my area of study is

00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,839
students with invisible disabilities so

00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,479
that might include a learning disability

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:46,059
autism spectrum disorder ADHD emotion

00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:50,170
and behavior disorders which do affect

00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:53,469
learning so everything in that realm and

00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:55,839
we've found so if you're familiar with

00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:58,539
Seymour popper in the history of

00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:02,619
computer science education it's based on

00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:04,599
the idea of constructivism and what he

00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:09,279
also calls constructionism which is

00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:13,829
building to learn but we have found for

00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:18,719
those students they need help accessing

00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:22,859
constructionist activities so we have a

00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:26,410
philosophy of supported construction

00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:30,390
constructivism so what that means is we

00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:33,489
scaffold the process for students we

00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:35,410
focus on all of their executive

00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:39,579
functioning skills we help them set

00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:41,799
goals we help them plan we help them how

00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:44,319
do you break down a project how do you

00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:47,769
plan a project how do you figure out

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,989
steps all of those things we scaffold to

00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:51,759
start to teach them how to do this so

00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:54,650
that they can have access to these more

00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:57,080
open-ended projects we want to start

00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,840
with direct instruction but we don't

00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,180
want to leave them at direct instruction

00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:05,930
because then they wouldn't be able to

00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:09,440
access the richer learning experiences

00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:49,550
so they need the direct instruction to

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:51,410
start if you couldn't hear you thing

00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:54,740
there are ways to configure the screen

00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:58,000
reader to read indentation in Python for

00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:01,180
programmers who are low vision or blind

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,180
thank you

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:26,030
yep yep so this was part of the problem

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:28,970
we were trying to address with the

00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:31,010
Raspberry Pi in a box program because we

00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,020
were running into these problems with

00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,700
just doing things in the browser and we

00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,700
wanted to move them out of that we

00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:41,870
couldn't afford to buy laptops for the

00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:47,510
school so we said okay let's try with

00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:49,700
raspberry PI's so that's one way there

00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,790
are different options I mean I think

00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:56,960
just using the best tools in the browser

00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:59,870
that you can is probably the most

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:06,080
realistic unless you can you know

00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:08,900
influence school budgets etc a lot of

00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,530
times though if you are in a position to

00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:15,470
advise administrators on their tech

00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:17,480
purchases we have been advising them to

00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,850
purchase laptops instead of Chromebooks

00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,980
they don't understand why so they really

00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:25,280
need education on why that's important

00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,330
and an explanation of how it will

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,330
benefit their students

00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:07,260
do you mean in the context of giving

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:09,420
Chromebooks I mean I would say so

00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,869
for when I think about Google I think

00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:17,640
about Google CS first which we use with

00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:21,900
students so thinking about applying some

00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:24,390
of these things to CS first and the open

00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:29,160
education resources that Google puts out

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:31,250
there so for example I know I know

00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,980
they've done a lot of testing in schools

00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:38,460
and it solves some problems for example

00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,080
it's not like the tutorials where the

00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,550
students just do the thing they're told

00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,500
and then they're not able to really

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,270
retain it they have to take in some

00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,330
information and then apply it to their

00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:49,770
project but then they also get lost they

00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:52,290
don't know where they are what to do

00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:55,790
next they need education for like how to

00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:59,010
use the interface so I would say just

00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:01,260
talking with teachers and being having

00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:06,180
the engineers themselves go into the

00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:08,010
classroom is a great start not just you

00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,740
know somebody on the customer service

00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:16,140
side but the engineers who are making

00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:19,290
decisions about the product and oh and

00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:21,630
then just also to talk to somebody to

00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:39,780
bring in an expert to talk about

00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:42,480
accessibility as well yeah well part of

00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:45,750
the reason in if we look at the k-12 CS

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,030
framework we have a lot of curriculum

00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:51,300
related to this strand about programs

00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,609
and programming and algorithms we don't

00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,950
have a lot of curriculum related to this

00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:57,790
trends about computer

00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:01,339
systems and networks in the Internet and

00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:03,170
the people who are sort of running the

00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:06,079
CS framework they are actually looking

00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,730
for curriculum when they talk about

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,520
alignment they don't mean

00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:13,280
oh you're aligned to this one area they

00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:17,869
mean you hit on everything in our

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,400
framework and so that's a huge need that

00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:21,910
needs to be filled and I think that's

00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,910
part of it

00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:44,390
ah I have I have not that's a great idea

00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:49,430
that's actually part of so today during

00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:52,339
the sprint the mini Sprint's part of my

00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:53,959
sprint is about doing some of these

00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:57,229
things building some of these templates

00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:59,329
and one of the projects is charting the

00:54:57,229 --> 00:55:02,509
framework for a database that will

00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:06,079
eventually become a guide for non

00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:10,339
educators to be able to look up

00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:14,150
standards and understand them I think

00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:17,509
that's a ways off I definitely haven't

00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:23,269
seen it for I haven't seen it for non

00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:24,890
educators and where the places that do

00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:28,279
have this kind of thing definitely don't

00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:31,749
have computer science standards as part

00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:31,749
of their database so

00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:56,249
yeah exactly and so somebody in

00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:59,339
technology I feel like a big problem is

00:55:56,249 --> 00:56:01,019
it's not just finding the local CS

00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:04,680
standards that apply to you because it's

00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:06,150
different for every state and it can be

00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,519
different for different classes and

00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:11,279
grade levels where you go to even look

00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:14,789
to find these sets of standards right

00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:16,980
are they getting a CSE is it an AP

00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:21,690
course is it you know in a state that

00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:23,039
has adopted CS standards in addition to

00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,749
that like you're saying they don't have

00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,309
time during the school days so many of

00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:28,710
them will want to do it as part of

00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:32,160
another subject area and then you need

00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:36,660
to find and interpret those standards

00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:41,390
for that subject area so it would be

00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:44,700
amazing to see a project that helps

00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:46,710
people in technology to not just find

00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:50,190
the applicable standards for their

00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:52,069
projects but that sort of interprets it

00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:57,660
for them that helps them to understand

00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:59,759
how that fits into their project so if

00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:07,819
anyone wants to brainstorm about that

00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:07,819
please join our mini sprints yep

00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:26,579
Oh awesome question he asked about what

00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:29,339
role do I see for para educators are you

00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:31,640
so it's there are different terms in

00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:34,319
different states will you just clarify

00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,299
what you mean do you mean a like a a

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,369
para who's a teaching assistant or a

00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:42,559
para educator who's like running an

00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:42,559
informal learning program out of school

00:57:57,229 --> 00:58:03,900
okay

00:57:58,499 --> 00:58:07,769
I see okay so it's not um in New York a

00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,119
para educator is somebody who assists

00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:11,069
specifically with students with

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:21,359
disabilities in the classroom that's not

00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:24,359
what you mean right yeah okay awesome

00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:28,650
but in the classroom yes so this is

00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:30,269
something well specifically to para

00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:34,349
educators who might help students with

00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:37,259
disabilities I've done research with my

00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:44,219
Israel related to this she has a guide

00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:47,369
up which I'll have to share uh I don't

00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:50,849
know where it is exactly she has a guide

00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:55,170
up online in her lab about how to help

00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:57,119
para educators to teach the F and how to

00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:59,910
train them and how teachers can work

00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,829
with them to be more effective and I

00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:04,589
think a lot of the same principles would

00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:06,239
apply so it's about training them even

00:59:04,589 --> 00:59:09,380
if the teacher has to be sort of

00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:12,799
modeling and training them on the fly

00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:15,599
teaching them emphasizing least to most

00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:19,529
interventions so meaning not having them

00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:22,049
jump in and do for the student not just

00:59:19,529 --> 00:59:24,580
para educators but teachers also have a

00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:26,830
tendency to Oh

00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,800
some big fix I'm just gonna jump in here

00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:32,350
and start typing we tell students not to

00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:35,560
touch each other's keyboards or mice or

00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:39,310
materials and we tell teachers not to

00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:41,410
touch students keyboards or materials

00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:44,410
and the same would be for para educators

00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:47,080
so I think really emphasizing how they

00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:48,690
don't need to be fully trained to be

00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:52,750
able to walk a student through

00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:55,570
problem-solving and to not try to solve

00:59:52,750 --> 01:00:03,550
the problem for them which is a natural

00:59:55,570 --> 01:00:07,710
instinct yeah the cut oh thank you thank

01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:07,710
you for finding it I appreciate it

01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:21,659
awesome all right thank you so much

01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:21,659
