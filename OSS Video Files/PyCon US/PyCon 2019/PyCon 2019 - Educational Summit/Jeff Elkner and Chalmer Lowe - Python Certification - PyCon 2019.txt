good morning everyone I'm gonna start

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,980
off with two questions please raise your

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:13,320
hand if you are in k-12 education oh

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,610
good excellent excellent raise your hand

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,000
if you consider yourself to be an

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,699
activist in the Python community okay

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,710
perfect so what I'm going to talk about

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,060
I would argue is of interest to both

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,699
those communities and why they need to

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,349
work together which is Python

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,560
certification I'm going to give you a

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,920
specifically k-12 slant on that and

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,170
Chalmer will be fine following up with a

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,510
broader look at certification so real

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,809
quickly I'm and I'm gonna Elizabeth is

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,789
given I mean I'm has I've had to fail so

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm gonna deviate a little bit from my

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,200
from my slides but especially since I've

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,760
been so inspired by the talks this

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
morning and I think we need to have a

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,670
conversation about that so I've been a

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,100
high school teacher since 1991 I started

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,930
teaching computer science in 1993 I've

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,090
been active in the seat and the free

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,979
software movement and in the open

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,030
educational resource movement for a long

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,250
time and I've loved it I'm a bit of a

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,260
rebel and I work for Arlington public

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,600
schools and they've kind of let me do

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,130
that and it's so it's been fun to teach

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,070
for all these years I still love

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,439
teaching I have 16 students here and

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,020
I've told them to mix it up so please

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,580
say hi to them talk to them they're a

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,840
little bit shy they're kind of grouping

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,210
together I told them I got to get out

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,210
and mix it up with you all so please do

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:38,430
that and and thank you for that so why

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,329
do I care about Python certification

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,649
well I am a CTE teacher Career and

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,159
Technical Education that's what they

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,170
call me

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,180
and beginning I'm gonna read this

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,509
beginning with first-time ninth graders

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,340
in 2013-2014 school year requirements

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,930
for the standard diploma shall include a

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,000
requirement to earn a Career and

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,079
Technical Education credential that has

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,329
been approved by the board so it is now

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,090
mandated for Virginia teacher CTE

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,119
teachers to give certifications I have

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,979
resisted this for years I just try not

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,670
to do it because these things can be

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,849
pretty awful

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,400
and I'm kind of now there are two Python

00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:23,410
certifications and so I'm going to talk

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,950
about those so there are some benefits

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:30,459
I've seen to the certifications they

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:34,600
provide a common measurable

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:37,120
I guess measurement of skill and they

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,580
provide a common reference point for

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,840
curriculum development so those are two

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,580
potential positives the cons which I

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,370
personally felt for the longest time way

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,700
outweigh the pros are that they limit

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,069
creativity because they enforce

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,750
standardization and mediocrity I mean

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,080
seriously we have a state mandate and

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,430
you gotta pass this test and and let me

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,530
tell you I heard so many innovative

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,709
things this morning about raspberry PI's

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,280
and and in an interesting curriculum it

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,260
is dead in the water if teachers are

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,750
being told that what they have to do is

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,810
get their kids to pass this Microsoft

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,570
MTA 98 - for 81 certification because

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,190
that's their job depends on that and as

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,500
long as their job depends on that

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,000
they're gonna have to do that and

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,859
they're not going to hear all these

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,180
other cool things that they might be

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:34,150
able to do so and and and also the

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,310
certifications have a real strong kind

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,780
of corporate bias and you know for me

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,470
that's not the kind of thing I want to

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,269
be communicating so with in the Virginia

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,060
Department of Education presently there

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,530
are only two Python certifications the

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,359
first one has been around for a while

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,640
it's the one I mentioned it's it's part

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,640
of the Microsoft technology associate

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,489
exam and it's called introduction to

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,280
programming with Python the other ones

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,859
have just emerged on the screen I mean

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,480
on the scene this year I actually have

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,670
now taken both of these two

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,350
certifications so I can tell you a

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,720
little bit about them if you're a k-12

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,180
teacher interested in my thoughts on it

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,730
it seems to be that pearson is

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,180
developing a whole stack of Python

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,280
certifications and cisco has been

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,970
partnering with them so the virginia do

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,110
he approves Cisco's test and Microsoft's

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,960
test

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,970
so I went looking on the web before I

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,860
gave this talk and said well what is

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,290
best out there if you were going to do

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,380
certifications not surprisingly dr.

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,350
Chuck shows up on the top right and but

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,300
none of these are the certifications

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,610
well there is this introduction to

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,770
Python absolute beginner 4 by Microsoft

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,020
at X I haven't seen that I don't know if

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,810
that relates to their certification exam

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,710
my hunch is it doesn't but I I'll have

00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:00,440
to check that out further and so I'm

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,270
gonna go a little bit quickly through

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,770
these slides to talk about what we might

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,020
want to do next because I've only got a

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,150
couple of minutes so I did some research

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,740
because this is all new so now you have

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,830
this thing called the open education

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,130
open edie open edge Python Institute

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:19,570
they're developing this exam and then

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,380
cisco is using it these are the three

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,990
certifications that they're going to be

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,350
offering now the pcap was the first I

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,390
took the pcap back in October and the

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,560
others didn't exist when I was preparing

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,920
the slides for this Oh

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,580
there's two more now so I'm gonna

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,500
reflect on those so the P cap was is is

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,150
fairly expensive so it's in fact it's so

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,980
expensive our school systems not going

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,390
to offer it because we have some deal

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,130
with Microsoft where we can offer the

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,560
other one because we've already paid for

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,440
some package and that's the one my

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,040
students are gonna have to take it does

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,190
Ally align fairly well with like the

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,890
solo learn course I found this to be the

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,350
least offensive of the two exams it's

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,810
kind of like they're more like ap puzzle

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,670
type tests they're short they they're

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,400
testing the syntax of the Python

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,670
programming language I found it to be

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,200
fairly challenging i I've been a high

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,030
school teacher for many many years but

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,690
I'm actually I learned some Python

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:24,410
tricks in preparing for it so it was it

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,330
was of the to the least offensive this

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,130
is not the one I'm going to be giving I

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,930
have to give the MTA 98 - 381 because we

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,400
can offer that unlimited times for free

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:39,080
already that exam was horrible I I can't

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,930
tell you enough about how

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,479
it is a lot of reading it's not at all

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,610
ALL friendly I mean I had students who

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,949
should have known Python fail that test

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,050
because you it's you're driven through

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,539
this time thing where you have to answer

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,199
a bunch of questions after reading droll

00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:59,150
texts and in fact I describe it as

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,669
having an unintentional corporate drone

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,370
bias and the theme of the thing you know

00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,900
you read this oh you're the you're the

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,969
manager of such-and-such region and

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,740
you've got a book you know who's what

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,050
high school kids gonna care about that

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,740
and then you answer some little question

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:19,810
about that so that's really pretty awful

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:24,370
and that's what we're giving right now

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:27,169
so in the interest of hacking that

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,629
situation because I went looking for ups

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,819
let me back up so in the interest of

00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,650
looking for resources to help students

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,330
prepare there's tons of them but you

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,000
have to pay for most of them everybody's

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,689
commodifying their prep for this mm you

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,949
know exam that's required and we I've

00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:46,460
got a group of students he'll be

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:50,449
pitching a mini sprint this afternoon

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,879
we've started to create our own power

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,159
through Python certification so at least

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,440
we can yeah we can make up we can

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,229
problem you know that would make a

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,289
problem out of together solving this

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,300
thing that we all have to do it's not my

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,339
students are actually in a dual enrolled

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,169
program that is going to give them an

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:12,289
associate degree in computer science

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,569
when they finish school and now actually

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:17,719
what I'm interested in after hearing dr.

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,490
Chuck is teaching his program right I

00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,319
mean what you know what you laid out is

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,870
pretty much what I'm already working on

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,500
and a series of course is all open

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,409
source

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,500
we need a certification so we need to

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,300
find a way as the Python community to

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,159
have a certification that we have some

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,000
input into because we don't have any

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,250
input into this and if we ignore this

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,180
problem and we have for a long time we

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,000
didn't want anything to do with it that

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,790
was fine but for me I can't avoid it I'm

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,910
a public school teacher Virginia has

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,980
mandatory k12 computer science standards

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,640
now will we have to teach computer

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,820
science

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,130
all across the state from the all across

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,970
the grades and this certification is

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,870
part of that so having an approved

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,570
certification that the Python community

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,490
has some input into would be such a

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,430
wonderful thing I think for our

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:16,630
community and thank you very much I

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,630
[Applause]

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,010
appreciated Jeff's comments I'm going to

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,540
elaborate on those a little bit

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,540
especially toward the end

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,300
my name is Chalmer tell you a little bit

00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,370
about Who I am and kind of the role that

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,010
I have in terms of certs and the types

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,830
of certs that I've pursued and the

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,290
things that I've seen in acquiring and

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,570
looking at some of those certifications

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,790
I work for a company called Booz Allen

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,620
Hamilton I do cybersecurity related

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,110
things I also do a lot of data analysis

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,720
and data science types of things I do a

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,850
lot of teaching I've taught in the

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,070
collegiate field and in the commercial

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,200
field I teach in my client space I teach

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,390
to people at Booz Allen Hamilton I teach

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,530
at meetups etc etc and I help run the

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,500
education summit every year I think this

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,990
is my fifth year helping to facilitate

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,150
the education summit I am a

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,560
certification holder I don't necessarily

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:22,120
say that proudly I do have some I am an

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,590
exam author for certification exams

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,870
these are some of the certs that I have

00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,870
again none of these are particularly

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,640
things that I necessarily hold up

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,100
proudly etc they're just there many of

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,170
them I acquired because either I got a

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,630
chance to take it my employer might have

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,390
paid for it or because I felt like it

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,730
might be a way to influence my resume so

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,610
the decisions might sway my direction

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:52,370
when I wanted to get a new job or take

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:53,870
on a new opportunity Jeff mentioned a

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,730
couple of certs that are out there there

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,390
is another cert out there that is

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:03,170
related to Python it's the GPU I see the

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,690
GPU I see is a cert that is associated

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,360
with Jack the global information

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,880
assurance

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,709
certification they're an organization

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,760
that is focused on information assurance

00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:17,760
or cybersecurity jack has a wide variety

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,899
of certifications that they offer this

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,959
one is the only one they have thats

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,060
related to python Jack's sister

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,829
organization sans which stands for

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,680
sysadmin Audit Network and security

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:31,019
those folks offer a class that helps you

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,680
to prepare and get ready to be able to

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,300
pass the the gpy C certification later

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,760
on you'll be able to get the slides and

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,079
the URLs to get to some more details

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,850
about these at the bottom of this slide

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:47,040
in the small font the skills that are

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,630
covered in the gpy C are a lot of the

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,750
typical types of things that you might

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,790
see in any sort of kind of Python class

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,640
how do you make executables what are

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,260
data structures all those kind of things

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,970
there is a focus or nuance though to

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,950
this class this class was intended for

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,600
penetration testers people who are doing

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,209
vulnerability assessments people who

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,430
have an interest in cyber security and

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:11,820
information assurance so there is a bit

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,769
of kind of a leaning toward that but

00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,260
nonetheless while learning those really

00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,699
cool cybersecurity skills you know

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,380
getting your hacker on if you will

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:23,339
you're also learning a lot of cool

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,920
Python terms some of the details for

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:29,040
this particular cert the exam is

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,459
proctored by Pearson VUE it is 75

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:37,529
questions about a two hour exam the cost

00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,779
of the test it's close to $800 if you

00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,579
wanted to take the SANS class it's six

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:47,760
thousand six hundred dollars to take a

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:49,980
six day class okay a little bit of

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,699
confession time here we're all amongst

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,890
friends so I'll tell you the truth I

00:12:52,699 --> 00:13:00,209
worked for sans I worked for Jack back

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:02,310
in around 2010 I reviewed course content

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:04,709
that was delivered in some of the sans

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,680
classes there were several of them and I

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,779
authored exam questions so back in 2010

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,240
I had a very good view into how Jack

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:15,600
went about creating questions that they

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,339
used to kind of assess people's skills

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,050
I do not currently work for them I've

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,540
not worked for them for about eight

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,649
years

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,180
but I just want to let that get that out

00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:26,630
there right and let you know that the

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,100
next few slides these are my opinions

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,910
the these are all buyer beware

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,779
okay so I'll talk a little bit about the

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,519
pros of kind of the jak certifications

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:43,440
etc we'll talk a little bit about the

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:45,300
cons and then we'll close off with much

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,910
like Jeff was talking about how does the

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,680
Python community create a certification

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,680
for the Python community that meets the

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,649
needs that we have right so in terms of

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,149
some of the pros for the jaya

00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:01,529
certification they generally have a

00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:04,019
fairly strong reputation when I speak to

00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:06,930
people who are looking say to hire folks

00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,810
in the cybersecurity field and they see

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,940
a certification from JAC that tends to

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,139
lend a certain amount of weight I don't

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,000
want to characterize how much but a

00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,670
certain amount so that registers on a

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,839
resume to a hiring manager those kind of

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,430
things the weight that they carry is

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,720
often a little higher than some of the

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,610
certifications you might see from other

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,100
organizations right so they have a

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,019
strong reputation in the community based

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,540
on my experiences both in reviewing the

00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,899
author content and in writing exam

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:40,410
questions I feel like that a very high

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,029
level of quality in those exams they put

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,730
a lot of professional effort into the

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:47,610
things like regular and consistent

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,459
review processes multiple levels of

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,899
review I got many of my questions kicked

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:54,209
back like hey can we clean these things

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,720
up in various ways they use a lot of

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,899
psychometric types of evaluations to get

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,160
a quantitative answer does this question

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:05,220
essentially address the types of things

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,720
that you want to have addressed they run

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,220
them through a whole series of tests

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,839
exams so that people who have already

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,370
passed the certifications

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,810
they'll take these new questions and

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,610
make sure that those questions are

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,389
answerable by people who have the skills

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,069
that we've already claimed that they had

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:28,889
the training content is is generally

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:30,389
fairly spot-on in terms of the focus for

00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,000
this particular cert because there's a

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,720
cybersecurity focus you know that helps

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,060
to bring

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,529
these resume a little closer to two

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,540
different skill sets both of which are

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,120
in high demand the ability to automate

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,829
in program as well as the ability to

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,889
address things from a cybersecurity

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,839
perspective so that that extra focus on

00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:53,149
cybersecurity could be a pro it could be

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,740
neutral terms of cons the biggest con

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,360
probably the cost right

00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,339
we were talking or Jeff was mentioning

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,600
some of the costs of the certs he talked

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,610
about and there's a significant

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,779
difference just for the SIRT much less

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,779
for the classes right

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,189
I have no recommendation here about gee

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,009
you or your students should go out and

00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:15,689
get this particular cert so I'm not

00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,100
gonna say that it is a worthwhile thing

00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:20,009
that's a decision I'll let other people

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,420
make but what I am interested in and

00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,569
what we'll talk about here for the last

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,970
couple of minutes is what makes a cert

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:30,769
worthwhile and if the open source

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:33,839
community pursues trying to build a cert

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:37,949
that we want to stand behind what should

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,889
be included in that certainly the class

00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:43,500
qualities that will help people prepare

00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,149
for a cert I mean that's fundamental and

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,000
I think that's something that we can all

00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,709
get behind right classes need to be well

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,860
designed the learning experience should

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,540
be high quality as well the exams

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,300
themselves if you are looking to create

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,759
a certification exam you know the exam

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,970
must be relevant and it must have the

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,159
backing of things like psychometrics can

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,630
we check to see if the question is a

00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:09,600
valid question is a reasonable question

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,030
is it simply rote memorization or is it

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,000
application is it assessment those kinds

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,760
of considerations does the cert have

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,069
perceived quality again if I'm looking

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,870
at a resume and I see a cert by

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,939
organization X or I see a certified

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,890
organization Y and I feel that

00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:29,549
organization Y has consistently

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,830
delivered staff to me who have skills

00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,980
that are represented by that cert on the

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,200
resume right so a cert we produce must

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,960
have perceived quality and people must

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,640
be able to see that certain go ah yeah I

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,260
know what's behind that cert and I know

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,250
what to expect when I bring that person

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,350
onto my team

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,410
and there has to be some level of

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,930
perceived return on investment right a

00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,850
lot of the the sand certifications those

00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,260
are actually funded by companies large

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,060
companies will go out and they'll pay

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,880
money to send their employees to get a

00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:04,030
sand certification so those employees

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,500
could then be offered up to clients etc

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,110
like we have people with these certs

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,000
those kind of things so if a company is

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,680
going to invest in getting a cert that

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,330
this open-source community comes up with

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,280
they have to have a sense they're going

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,680
to get a return on their investment an

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,750
open source is often very low cost right

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,000
so that's probably an easy bar to make

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:27,940
but it's definitely something we need to

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,950
consider and that's the end of Jeff and

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,220
is essentially kind of for ray into this

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,900
conversation I hope that over the next

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,190
couple of hours when we get into sprints

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,110
and stuff if folks have thoughts or

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,730
ideas I'm sure Jeff and I would both

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,890
love to hear those things we'd love for

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,770
you to share with us what you feel ought

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,780
to be included in certs and hopefully as

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,540
we as a community over the next six

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,000
months twelve months years we can start

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,160
to look at what is a certain and what

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,710
should be an assert and what can we do

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,900
to ensure that certifications that are

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:03,910
useful meaningful to us and to our our

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:06,820
students can promulgate and with that my

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,030
time is about up so I'll be around

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:15,520
afterwards for questions

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:15,520
