Title: Adopting QPython in smartphones for teaching learning  computational science and engineering
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: PyCon 2019 - Educational Summit
Description: 
	"Speaker: Godfrey Akpojotor

I have been teaching undergraduate computational physics for more than a decade in my university. Adopting Python as our programming language has really helped because of its unique qualities which made it easily accessible and easy to teach/learn. However, providing enough computing devices to the increasing number of students has been a serious challenge. This is even more frustrating when one require to involve online classroom submission/evaluation of assignments. I have overcome this challenge by adopting QPython in smartphones which are rapidly penetrating Africa. With a built-in math library and possibility to install Numpy, QPython in smartphones has made the teaching/learning to more students more efficient especially as they can now engage in learning programming anywhere, anytime and anyhow. The success made me extend it to one of our current projects under the Python African Computational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSETPro) on teaching Python to students, new beginners as well as expert programmers in science and engineering (S & E).   In this talk, I gave a captivating account on how to use QPython to teach computational approaches in S & E in a manner that advancing to normal computing systems is straightforward. Highly excited by the success so far, our outlook is having both Matplotlib  and QVPython in smartphones. This will be a boon for teaching/learning computational approaches anywhere, anytime and anyhow.

okay so once my good money just like

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:14,309
intruder Shah so much has been discussed

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,940
yes and really overwhelmed

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,880
we Python has actually gone the last

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,890
time I attended a trip icon was in 2008

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,470
with a Silicon Valley and within that

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:33,809
six or seven years so much has actually

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,850
happened so I'm going to see what we are

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,540
trying to do because all these nice

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:44,670
things some people are not going to

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,250
benefit from them like Mac said this

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:53,660
money he said we need to be able to

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:57,680
empower everybody child adult from all

00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:01,590
divers kosher and geographica by agra

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,870
with guitars crochet and see what the

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,360
problem we can solve this is quite

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,890
interesting and as I go on this talk we

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,799
are going to see that there was an

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:16,680
effort to do so in the past but he

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:19,860
didn't succeed so my talk is on how this

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,960
particular using you patrons muffle we

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,780
helped us in a come in accomplishing

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:30,960
that so first I will just hang the

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:34,200
educational summit committee for septum

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,990
ours abstract then I thank the

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,680
organizers of pinecone then the soft

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,899
year for the patrons of EF addition for

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,290
the invitation and of course the funding

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,509
because we Tottie's wouldn't be here now

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,880
I have been an active member of the

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,670
Python community and as I said I was at

00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:00,090
PyCon 2012 a Silicon Valley and my

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,490
trucks are there the first thing I want

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,189
to see is what why competition have

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,220
approaches I don't need to explain that

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,050
to an audience like this because people

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,230
it is nice tablished to do that

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,260
will lead competition emphasis why in

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,220
developing world computational physics

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:25,050
is restricted to maybe university

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:28,810
programs here I hear that high grades

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,060
already taking compare competition

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,930
official any program this is

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,440
overwhelming

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,570
so but there's one aspect I want to add

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,100
I'm not going to go into the details of

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,050
where we live conditional visas and

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,670
other bodies and aspects that is really

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:47,260
motivating me here today in research

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,900
what we do is that we have so many in

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,080
America's fourth year for serving

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,480
diverse from them my area I mean it I'm

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,120
a condensed matter physics so I work on

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,310
strongly correlated system and in that

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,870
place we have all kinds of software

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,210
today and from 70s like the sitting

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,480
fortunate jewelry dynamic feed

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,880
midfielder is their holiday and this

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
Sophia when new post graduate they

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,350
coming you want to introduce them to

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,380
some of this sort here if you introduce

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:23,620
them fine enough they will walk with it

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,690
but then the leader understand this

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,239
software for them to be able to

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:32,440
manipulate it to suit your own personal

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,820
problem isn't it that is it so and there

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,970
are so many of these Sophia another

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,130
tonight implemented in Python I just

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,050
give an example of this one that was

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,750
published recently see very good Sophia

00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,790
efficient Python implementation of the

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,010
continuous time hybridization and

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,770
expansion quantum impurity

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,290
Java is a very good one then they'll say

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:58,239
these trials of course that rom-coms

00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:01,900
boot in Python and his C++ okay so the

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,060
student elite understand this Sophia at

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,340
least the programming language of this

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,239
Sophia for them to be able to manipulate

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,390
them then of course wanting we also do

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,730
is that you have a soft we're in another

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:19,450
language if you want to bring it to

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:22,090
Python which is open an open source and

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,380
free you can also do that like this

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,410
particular a pack which is a food from

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,600
package very beautiful for solving

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,600
eating value and he giveth no problem

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,350
but today they have already imported it

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,580
into Syfy so this is these are some of

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,490
the reasons why we have to do

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,920
computational physics biology we know

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,770
that computer accountabilities have

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,080
evaded our initial any process as well

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,780
as research so much that in addition to

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,330
children and experiments as we all know

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,140
now they not constitute a thought killer

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:59,090
in science and engineering now but how

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,670
do we do this there is a big Western

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,850
improvement the question has been

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,580
answered here by difference because the

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,130
first thing is the desire to eat Delana

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,170
into programming to give them the

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:17,650
opportunity to develop a conceptual

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:21,170
model of what a program is what it knows

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,440
okay but how do we what is the strategy

00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:27,800
to achieve this conditional physics the

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,170
first thing is accessibility to compute

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,220
the device especially in developing

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:38,330
countries here you have a computer

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:42,970
science lab a competition emphasis

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:45,470
program you have a computer lab because

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,930
if you are taking a computational

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,180
physics class for three hours you need

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,180
to be able to have an equivalent a three

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,940
hours in the computer lab in 2008 I

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,190
attended the conference of organized by

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,300
the American physicist Isha a branch

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,770
investing in put in another point I

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,690
think adapt when you were about five

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,270
university that we are offering

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,340
competition emphasis in the US I was

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,380
true then I don't know if that has

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,330
increased

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,730
meaning that others university have

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:20,870
computer lab but this is not the case

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,490
with those developing countries you

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,890
discovered that I was teaching

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,960
composition emphasis and you'll in lab I

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,840
have assess who was the computer lab so

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,380
I have to share with them for a computer

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,290
science lab the hydrophone lab from

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,310
hundred level to four hundred level it

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,340
was not easy

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,530
yet for me to get in computed time so

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:47,240
this was one of the problem I faced for

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:50,390
so many years then this idea of using

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,540
the Q Python came in as a fashion of

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,000
Python in Android and so when I saw it

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,190
of course if something you dilute the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,950
entire occupy turn into your smartphone

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,340
and once you have done that you cannot

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,680
begin to use it anywhere anyhow and

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,390
anytime and that is the beauty of what

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,470
we attract number and I hope with that

00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:15,380
thought rushes you talk about taking the

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,720
Python everywhere so I see that maybe

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,380
you also helped us in writing a good

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:25,100
book Q Python so that you can spread the

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,240
message everywhere now

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,820
I just made sure that well there's an

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,390
attempt in the past to actually have

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,720
people have access to the computer this

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,600
was what recording wall a proper height

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,450
program it was study started in 2002

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,110
when a professor Nicholas Negroponte row

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,650
of empty MIT he went to Cambodia a small

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,450
village and he was able to see that by

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,000
letting these young kids they have

00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,490
access to computer connected computer

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,770
they were able to do wonderful team so

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,750
he came back to MIT to data look if we

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,300
can make I'm just summarizing make the

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,410
entire world that every child you have

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,930
access to a laptop then they can won't

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,200
believe the kind of potential they will

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:18,410
have and we cut him imaging what kind of

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,240
problem we are going to sell solve so

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,780
the program he coughed many God met

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,320
actually kid into it unfortunately the

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,200
probably project feed and one of the

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,080
reasons apart from many problems one of

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,320
the reason is that the actually produced

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,770
rugged computers at a very cheap rate

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,410
but unfortunately did not include

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,930
maintenance or repairs of this computer

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:48,410
when we are planning so as a computer D

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,270
got bad the the kids Deacon or appear

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,970
them

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,030
this become a very serious challenge now

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,660
the question is we cube patron off so

00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:02,410
far the same fit and my hand sir is

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,130
broadly new because it is not going to

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:10,180
be government-sponsored smartphones are

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,690
quiet maintained repair by whom by the

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,940
individuals and we already have in an

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,940
increasing global penetration of

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,830
smartphones into our homes so smart food

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,020
belongs to the individual so we are not

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,110
going to have issues of repair and all

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,480
that as we have with the One Laptop I

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,030
kids of course this Josie statistics

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,460
showing that in Africa the numbers of

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:37,870
smart foods are growing the reason is

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:41,200
this with $20 I can get a smartphone in

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:44,380
Africa with $20 I can get a smartphone

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,420
in Africa a good one and with that one I

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,950
can store my Q Python that is the beauty

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:55,560
of it which is not the same as a laptop

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:58,180
so our goal is to introduce them into

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,030
remarkable q python computing

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,630
capabilities in smartphones but how do

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,060
we do it

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,130
the philosophy is simple we want to be

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,230
able to guide the nana's the students

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,380
and in an assault that of course is what

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,890
we are between SOI daddy transition from

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,660
q python to python is straightforward so

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,040
once you able to learn whatever I want

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,470
to learn in Q Python if you have a

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,460
laptop or any other computer competitive

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,820
device it is straightforward then but

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,010
hard so hard a way doing this still and

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,530
in philosophy we tell you how to install

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,050
the Q Python yes will be having issues

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:38,950
with this face we started with Q Python

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:42,700
2.7 2 or fortunately it or not comes

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:45,850
with a default in Tunisia so you have to

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,760
start CEOs today and how to maybe how to

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,770
use the the tab and all that and it was

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,730
not funny good enough

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,710
we now have higher version 2.7 15 that

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,960
one comes with the natural integer that

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,140
one is for the kitchen so the problem in

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,800
fatty hazard if fortunately many of the

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,850
personality

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,820
as you know my title so another problem

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,700
we are having is taught party libraries

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,589
in the cube item two points able to be

00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,160
able to install non pipe but this one

00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:21,550
would be having issues installing non PI

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,620
into its and well not be able to work on

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,450
but I when I was coming I was also

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,370
having the confidence that I would meet

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,440
somebody would be able to tell me that

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,600
look this is how you can easily do it

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,320
please if you can please advise

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,329
then we teach our students how to use

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:44,250
coupon as an advanced cat litter yes

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:47,529
before now students in the it's not

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,680
maybe your what you call your high

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,200
school here they were not allowed to use

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,079
calculators for some years but I think

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,550
follow about four or five years nineteen

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,589
are you Scott literal but we are

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,450
naturally then that look your calculator

00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,730
is almost the same size as your

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,040
smartphone and you can actually use your

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,250
smartphone as an advanced cat litter you

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,320
can do much more than that then

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,660
basically we are we communist this Q

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,709
patrol using it as a limit free for a

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,910
metric programming first we able to let

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:21,760
our students know the difference between

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,010
Python to version of Pi 2 and 3 then we

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,320
set a body problem with repaired till

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:30,040
libraries and of course the number issue

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,959
a measured now when we teach what we let

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,390
us well known the difference between

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,329
smartphones and computer that would give

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,850
them two value of course of Python in

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:43,770
Android emulators when we started of

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,770
course in a classroom studio we have

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,390
laptops so we I said no it's going to

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,610
create for them for me because one of

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,440
the things where I just met let me just

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,380
make sure I prefer this clip icon is

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,089
that before when I teach my students

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,970
sending assignments it's always

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,790
difficult it's not like here where the

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,310
Internet is free and all that okay say

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,250
mean assignment is easy it is difficult

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,529
but with the Q Python now because with

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,209
very little amount of money you can get

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,459
your phones connected so with a cube

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,310
Python what we are doing now my students

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:19,249
and yes I'm

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,079
to me easily so when I have started this

00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:23,810
on student seeking with the Laplace okay

00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,819
know I want to teach you Q Python so

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,009
what we did is that for social they will

00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:30,259
use the Android emulators we study

00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:33,439
Android emulators into the answer so

00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:35,899
that accustomed work week you Titan now

00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,160
with teach them the temperature of

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,459
course the difference between

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,829
interpreted the EQ Python console the

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,199
editor the Cintas and the video

00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,819
statements vital variables these are the

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,660
key things you want to learn in any

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:54,410
Python language so the important here is

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,860
that of being for science and

00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:01,790
engineering the model we require is the

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:04,249
math model that is what we use so a most

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,670
of the teachings we'll be doing is based

00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:10,519
on this much model and how to use it to

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,470
solve different problems so we have the

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,079
control statement we have the functions

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,620
the data structures and of close the

00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,519
class

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,350
but even as simple as this I started a

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,600
project which we have done before with

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,129
Python the fight reduce clip Python and

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,550
that is how to use the cue Python to be

00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:34,759
able to take an inventory of a lab like

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:37,339
you have a lab and you have videos

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:41,389
equipments the World Forum ethnics the

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:43,399
one for electricity D we are all in the

00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:46,399
inventory so when you go to this small

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,459
app you see what is your name and this

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,500
what you want okay I want this

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:53,540
instrument then you see where this

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,240
instrument is available these are the

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,350
numbers not available you can find it is

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,660
one sous-chefs

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,629
so with this supporting our students

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:07,850
over yes I able to repeat this simple

00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:10,160
project then now that okay the focus on

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,779
the match model as I said before we

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,749
encourage our students to apply the

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:18,110
acute pythons key to Python codes like

00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:20,240
when okay after to clipart so now but

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,100
there is a difference between using the

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,170
cube python and the pattern for example

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,569
where we say soft quadratic equation and

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,990
rustic in this simple example we use no

00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:32,600
pie

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,850
where we use nope I will use the poly

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,220
Wanda for Jean the Pali Wanda for Jessie

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,709
natural a teeny in a non-player to give

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,370
it a function so but it's not there in

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:45,500
math lab in in the math module so how do

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,230
we do this we now ask the student gram

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,510
find out and from dead we were to see

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,630
after some train that they can use the

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:56,660
lambda expression which is for arbitrary

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,779
function so we charge any without no PI

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:04,550
now they able to solve problems which of

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:07,040
course they did that they used to use

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:11,360
just not back to find a winner that he

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,130
cannot use the MATLAB to solve them so

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,200
the things we do because it's for

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,310
science and engineering we saw things

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,899
like linear equation interpolations and

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,870
we also look at other differential

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,480
pressure which Raj could have fourth

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,870
order method what we do here is this I

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,360
guess he did you see we here for us to

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,339
really motivate the student there's what

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,140
I call the people and pain approach what

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,600
is the paper pen approach allowed

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,350
students to first solve this thing

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,029
manually so that is see the way the

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,620
computer works sometimes you see a

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,310
problem that will take you three four

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:52,490
pages but after the willfully could with

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,770
a touch of your keyboard or your trash

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,230
of your smartphone now you see that you

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,329
can solve the problem so the student

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,570
really able to appreciate what

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:06,079
programming is all about so these are

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:10,370
some of the things we we observe with

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,040
what with Q Python in our smartphone and

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:17,569
all these you can solve them with just

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:21,679
the math model so what is the absolu

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:25,400
here the outlook is we want a stable

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,550
version of Q Python with easy means to

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:32,950
install scientific third-party libraries

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:36,950
like nope I say PI sin PI and matplotlib

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:41,510
they also wants a situation if we can

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:43,550
add visual Python because I miss that a

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,070
lot when I used to of course when I used

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,160
to teach

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,440
with Python and one of the things I used

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,020
to well you know really inspire my

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,169
students a look at this program has

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,290
simply as it is you go to visual Patrol

00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:01,530
you just put sphere with your bracket

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:04,410
ICS Viacom you put color and gives you

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:10,440
the color so it used to be fun I like

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:14,610
what Jeff said he said it has not seen a

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,410
program that is radically advancing in

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,260
Sochi with that is possible is going to

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,540
take over or the program and I'm happy

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,820
that I'm going to do something with Jeff

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,330
we already be discussing good before I

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,040
came here

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,900
woofle be able to move that

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,380
collaboration because he's also decent

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,980
in Africa okay so other Latin is that

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,320
can we have Q Python we compiled

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,740
languages like C++ which is widely used

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,700
for scientific of competition can we

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:47,820
have videos version like the pipe and

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,799
the arrow patron can we possibly the

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,260
volute very early guard website designed

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,440
to develop videos crew Python apps on

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,270
smart phones I think this means report

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,549
banana and I want answers if you come

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,380
provide answers to me well I'm Erin

00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:03,150
please I'll be happy because one of the

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,270
things that is motivating this student

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:09,330
is that DC Canon I develop my own

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:13,410
application which in my husband I say

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:16,260
yes because Python is multi-purpose it

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,510
is used for every purpose it's not use

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,340
only for the teaching of physics as we

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,169
are doing here now but it is

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,990
multi-purpose so you can begin to

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:28,440
develop your own app and this actually

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:33,179
is at which India interest so as part of

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,220
the outlook we this year because it's

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,730
appropriate I started in last one year

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,309
and this year average the negotiating

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,320
within identity offices when you have

00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:45,540
their conference in Santa and in a

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,510
gesture of mathematical physics to have

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,910
their conferences November 2019 on our

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:54,030
to have a pre workshop

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:57,210
conference on teaching Leticia

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,980
here those who teach us a

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,679
conference we have two or three days pre

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,289
workshop conference on how to teach them

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,980
on how to use the handset that is

00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:09,539
smartphone Cupid so I did a trailer like

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,549
that before with the annihilation of

00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,220
Mathematica fees but I use Python that

00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:18,059
was at two years ago so this year now

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:21,419
where we had it we had issues of having

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,480
a nose piece having a nose piece then

00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:27,270
but with this one I think we'll have

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,559
that kind of issue already have to come

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:34,470
echo with yeah smartphones and as I said

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,309
smartphone with about twenty dollars you

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:41,700
can have an adroit version that is

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,740
compatible with the Q Python and that is

00:20:41,700 --> 00:21:00,960
the beauty of what we are doing

00:20:43,740 --> 00:21:02,760
thank you very much no though I am on

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,890
your Facebook but I've not been able to

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,529
reach them but I know the opportunity to

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,789
ask crystal but I know I'm going to

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:12,510
region obviously having a feeling that

00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:15,690
if they did usually at PyCon conference

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,890
we meet up other people so I will look

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,890
for them yes

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,650
yes they have q python 3.6 did group

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,480
eight or three points to point suit q

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,400
patron three point four

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,580
they are all working but they don't have

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,730
the usual in the attention default in

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,340
the attrition so the educational q

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,380
python that is the three point six that

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,560
one is having issue and of course the

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,600
the developers live , to see that they

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,990
have a lot of box which are trying to

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,620
fish but one Cupit or two point seven

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:25,730
point fifteen is working perfectly well

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:25,730
yes yes

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:36,440
science' technology okay we have the

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:42,160
National map America Center Buju I hope

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:46,250
you are well feet and around 2000 it's I

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,700
started a conference they call it

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,860
international seminar on solid care

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,170
physicians not development the aim was

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,470
to horn oh one of our very senior

00:23:54,170 --> 00:24:01,220
professor is a professor emeritus who

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,980
taught in many investors in in the u.s.

00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,840
here before going back to Nigeria and he

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,910
has produced a lot of people so when he

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,800
was over two years then I was in Germany

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,990
I was at mass planck institute or

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,900
physics or complex system we I was in my

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,480
postdoc so I decided to organize a

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:21,740
conference for him after the first one

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,260
the second one in 2010 I added in

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,500
Fantasia postgraduate course to it and

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:30,560
that was great cause was on Python so I

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,500
have been teaching Python as as a part

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:37,070
of that seminar which we are beholden

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,960
annually since 2009 it's many of the

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,600
when I said Cindy tisha the national

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,270
market center was actually met for

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,740
teaching the tisha

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,200
letitia's

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,630
and I have been teaching Python there

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,000
and I think in sheer people come back

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,650
you do know have people come back they

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,080
were they would say look I met somebody

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,290
who said in large Python and is now

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,080
using Python for his work especially the

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,700
matplotlib will use it in plotting their

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,500
graph and all kinds of T and it's quite

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,910
beautiful so since 2010 our be teaching

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,770
Python at the National map marker Center

00:25:09,910 --> 00:26:14,590
and I think it had been a Nova Ramirez

00:25:11,770 --> 00:26:16,260
or what I said I teach in the tesha that

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,750
is the first place we have to start from

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,700
because as I said yes many of them the

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,770
program didn't know is what it was

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,390
sticked to so we tell you they are used

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,620
to food Fran and all that and they will

00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:31,960
stick to it but from our past program

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,790
we've seen that when you teach there

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,410
many of them they go back and pass a

00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,570
message Randa this programming language

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,090
is good and the beauty of it is that did

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,520
download a host of I always teach Emma

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,820
to download do stuff you know without

00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:50,740
Spain and all that and this is it and as

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:53,890
we have said I have had the opportunity

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:56,290
of firing in number of people like when

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,740
I trained at this conference in 2012 are

00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,980
today with one of my stew

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,140
okay and the good thing here is that

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,149
when you see bring out ones like that

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,460
you let them have access to the computer

00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:10,130
because don't want a fourteen the young

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,409
Mac came here and he got here leads and

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,649
because of the kind of training I have

00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:17,059
given to him they give him an assignment

00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:19,070
when it was the animals he first passing

00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,230
to so to submit and that was the

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,539
pheasant in the class so the professor

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,490
said Wow so look how can this young man

00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,799
from Africa be the first to submit and

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:31,190
got it correct and so this young man has

00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:34,789
gone on to to obtain his master's and is

00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:37,250
pg a shopman University so this is the

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:39,620
kind of team then let me just make sure

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,080
this again even within my invest in am I

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,330
just got an approval from my

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,510
vice-chancellor to organize a workshop

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,970
on this Q Python as you know it's not

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,279
easy driving these things there but

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,399
because anything that has to do with

00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:57,470
spending money they were afraid it this

00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,289
is the problem but the beauty of Cupit

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,720
or why I am so excited about it you

00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,730
don't need to spend a couple the hazard

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,640
belongs to the person my own is to

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,640
suddenly what to do that there is power

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,710
in the handset you can use the hassle to

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,220
do your programming to layer programming

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,220
anywhere anyhow anytime thank you

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:24,260
