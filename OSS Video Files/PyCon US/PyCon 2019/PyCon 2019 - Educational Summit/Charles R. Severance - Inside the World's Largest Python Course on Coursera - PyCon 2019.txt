Description: 
	"Speaker: Charles R. Severance

This presentation will take a look at the “Python for Everybody” series of courses on the Coursera platform (www.py4e.com). This course has impacted over 2 million students over the last five years. We will look a the history and goals of the course and how the course works to create a learning community. We will show how the free open educational resources (OERs) and book associated with the course have been used by teachers, students, and courses around the world to form a network of educational activities centered around Python. We will also cover briefly the Tsugi (www.tsugi.org) software that is used to build the learning assessments and distribute the OER materials in a way that enables maximum reusability of the materials for other teachers.
