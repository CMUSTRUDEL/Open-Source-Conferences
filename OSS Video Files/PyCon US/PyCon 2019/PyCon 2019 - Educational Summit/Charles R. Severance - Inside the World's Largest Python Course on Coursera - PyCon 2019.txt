Title: Charles R. Severance - Inside the World's Largest Python Course on Coursera - PyCon 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: PyCon 2019 - Educational Summit
Description: 
	"Speaker: Charles R. Severance

This presentation will take a look at the “Python for Everybody” series of courses on the Coursera platform (www.py4e.com). This course has impacted over 2 million students over the last five years. We will look a the history and goals of the course and how the course works to create a learning community. We will show how the free open educational resources (OERs) and book associated with the course have been used by teachers, students, and courses around the world to form a network of educational activities centered around Python. We will also cover briefly the Tsugi (www.tsugi.org) software that is used to build the learning assessments and distribute the OER materials in a way that enables maximum reusability of the materials for other teachers.

and welcome this is my second PyCon ad

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,870
you summit and I'm glad to be back and

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,540
what I think is the world's largest

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,820
Python course I'm gonna keep saying that

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,500
until someone says no you're not the

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,640
world's largest Python course it's the

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,170
only way to figure out if you're the

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,270
largest Python course in the world is

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,519
just to assert that you are and then

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,330
people disagree with you so here's some

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,609
numbers to support that I've graduated a

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,940
hundred and forty thousand people out of

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,100
one of my many classes and four million

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,530
people have touched the class in one way

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,100
or another in the last 30 days I

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,390
graduated 4,500 new Python programmers

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,100
somewhere in the world

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,129
that's just my Coursera numbers and in

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,289
the last this is I went on EDX three

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,370
months ago we put the course on both

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,410
Coursera and EDX now and I'm basically

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,149
graduating a whole bunch of people on

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,290
EDX now as well so I've there's a lot of

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,970
people in this room that have a lot more

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,270
Python seniority than I do

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,119
I am relative to a lot of people I'm a

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,729
late comer to Python and so I I had a

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,040
life before Python I have three computer

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,600
science degrees including a PhD I've

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,090
taught virtually every programming

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,740
language that was cool from 1975 until

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,900
now

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,470
I building online educational technology

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,329
taught online since 97 I led the open

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,310
source a chi learning management system

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,560
project and I've been a leader in

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,009
building a thing called learning tools

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,780
interoperability which is how you plug

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,659
Piazza into Moodle and Piazza into

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,509
canvas and Piazza into blackboard and

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:50,700
and so that's where I'm coming from

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:54,570
I sort of met Python in 2008 when I was

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,829
I quit my job is the executive director

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,090
of the sky foundation because of a

00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,649
disagreeing with my board of directors

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,110
and I went and said I'll be a faculty

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,030
member instead and so I walked into a

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,259
classroom at a school of information at

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,939
the University of Michigan which is a

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,710
school of library science and I was

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,750
presented with a classroom full of

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,959
librarians and told to teach them

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,440
programming and the first TAS I had to

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,090
find

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,470
was a textbook and so I didn't like any

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,360
textbook even though there were

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,390
thousands of Python textbooks even in

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,030
2008 and so what I did is I had to write

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,210
my own textbook and I started with the

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,360
the least worst Python textbook I could

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,580
find which thanks to Jeff elke nur he

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,820
Jeff and Alain wrote the least worst

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,760
computer science textbook that I could

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,030
find and then I threw 75% of it away and

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,660
wrote and added back to it and that's

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,230
because I and I'll try to only say this

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,720
once

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,310
I am NOT a computer science educator I

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,410
have no desire to be a computer science

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,750
educator I'm not all excited about

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,130
taking every kid in the world and making

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,390
them a computer science major I was a

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,430
computer science major it's a rather

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,290
narrow field it's not everything that we

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,670
need I do on the other hand think

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,260
everyone needs to understand programming

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,840
technology and so that's sort of where

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,980
I'm coming from and so I vowed when I

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
started teaching this class to

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,280
librarians that I was going to teach a

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,570
technology class and a programming class

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,730
and it was going to be fun it was going

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,550
to be joyful is gonna be artistic it was

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,320
going to be engaging and so I am NOT

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,580
interested in lambda expressions I'm not

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,290
interested in recursion I'm not

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,760
interested in and login and I just don't

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,640
think a bunch of nine-year-olds need to

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,900
hear about n log n actually thirty year

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,310
olds don't even need to hear about n log

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,200
n what thirty year olds need to hear is

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,730
hey just use a database right and

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,150
somebody else wrote it all and you don't

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,880
have to know that so I was sort of a

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,440
Python educator for a while in my own

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,110
little world and then the MOOC

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,610
revolution happened in 2012 and my first

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,140
reaction was not to teach Python as a

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,070
MOOC my first reaction was to teach a

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,230
course called internet history

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,230
technology and security which was of

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,050
course to trick liberal arts majors into

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,489
learning the tcp/ip stack literally

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,780
that's what this course is and that's

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,940
why it says history it's like hey

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,530
liberal arts majors you could like this

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,790
this could be fun it's just a history

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,580
class that's gonna talk about World War

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,900
2 and enigma and Bletchley Park and all

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,660
these wonderful things and I'll show you

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,130
videos of Bletchley Park and oh wait a

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,840
sec and then there's a thing called

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,310
tcp/ip at stacks on top and so what I

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,769
would do is I would I call it boiling

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,479
the Frog right I would teach them that

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,890
every liberal arts major who just

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,110
thought history was cool could

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,120
eventually understand public private

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,560
certificates and encryption and encode

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,270
at the end I'm tea I'm giving quizzes

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,520
that are all in wrote 13 and I'm making

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,160
them decode the wrote 13 quizzes in

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,690
order to answer my quizzes anomic ha ha

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
technology is not so bad so part of my

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,240
whole life has been to trick people into

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,729
liking technology so as I was building

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,880
my Python course I built this in browser

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:49,889
100% in browser Python development

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,720
environment based on the sculpt compiler

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,639
that compiles Python to JavaScript and

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,780
then executes it but I actually was

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,760
really interested in turning into a

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,590
grading system not a development system

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,060
using this thing that I developed called

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,830
learning tools interoperability which

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,940
allows you to build a tool plug that

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,680
tool into a learning management system

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,310
like canvas or Coursera and send a grade

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,990
back so I was trying to scale this and

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,960
inadvertently I I built the entire first

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,639
I didn't set out to do this but the

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,160
first 10 chapters of my book can be done

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,389
completely on a phone right because it's

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,740
all in browser can be done on a

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,510
Chromebook can be done literally on

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,490
anything because it just runs Python in

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,740
the browser and it sends the grades back

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,180
and my teaching assistants said that

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,470
this was an important feature and I did

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,970
not think it was an important feature

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,289
when I started I thought it was really

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,900
important to teach people how to install

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,060
Python on their real computers and do it

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,710
but it turns out to be really brilliant

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,419
that I can teach the first 10 chapters

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,590
of this book without using a browser so

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:48,599
these are my tattoos and they're real

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,430
right here and I call them my my

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,430
research in my education otherwise known

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,960
as my curriculum Vita so I got PhD from

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,070
Michigan State University and I'm a

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,340
faculty member at the University of

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,380
Michigan PhD in engineering the faculty

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,910
position is in school library science

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,810
yellow elephant and Sakai and open

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,880
source and learning tools

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,370
interoperability was what the what this

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,830
side is about this is my research

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,660
educational technology is my research

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,490
open source open standards the last

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,250
tattoo I got was the Coursera tattoo

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,360
where I went out to Coursera and I added

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,860
learning tools interoperability into

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,599
Coursera so I could take my entire

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,500
Python class with its browser-based

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,639
assessments and plug it into Coursera I

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,099
did a few other things that are kind of

00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,949
fun I think that programming is about

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,390
people so I happened to write for I

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,039
Triple E computer magazine and had a

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,860
travel budget for a few years and I made

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,840
a bunch of videos one was of ghido

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,430
second video first video you see of my

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,110
classes me in the second video that you

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,430
see in the classes guiteau's welcoming

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,800
you to the class now you could actually

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,849
use Guiteau mygeeto video to welcome to

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,379
your class because he doesn't welcome

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:56,689
them to my class he says welcome to

00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:59,750
Python oops another thing that I do

00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,129
because I'm a frustrated actor actually

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,460
I'm you know I don't I would rather much

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:07,229
rather be a CNN anchor flying around the

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,270
world with a television crew than I am a

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:11,219
professor but I do this I do the next

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,319
best thing and that is I I make my

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,939
course into a reality show and so I go

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,800
all over the world and I meet my

00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,969
students I mean so much some of you may

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,500
have gotten an email this morning

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:21,000
because you are my students about my

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,409
next office hours in Detroit that's

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,909
gonna feature a race car anybody get

00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,909
that email yeah few people got that

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:28,469
email and so I have a map you can go see

00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:30,419
it it's 70 places all over the world

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,949
where I just said hey I'm gonna be at a

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,379
coffee shop in Amsterdam at 10 o'clock

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:35,969
on Sunday come by and then we make

00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,529
pictures and I make little videos and I

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,560
have a map that has all those videos

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:42,659
part of this is to take an otherwise

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,569
technical dry topic and make it be a

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,009
human topic people people people people

00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,210
oh and by the way we're gonna learn

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,289
about if statements this week people

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,370
people people people

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,520
oh we're gonna learn about loops this

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,270
week people people people so one of the

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,710
things that's cool when you have

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,089
millions of students is you learn

00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,190
something about the world

00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,990
I have blind students and as an engineer

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,279
I've always wanted blind students it's

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,469
just you don't run into them very often

00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,940
so this is a blind school in India that

00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,680
I was able to visit there's a blind

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,449
foundation out of Boston that supports

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,089
these schools I now financially support

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,520
these schools myself as well and I get

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,560
to meet blind students and they tell me

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,150
what works and what doesn't turns out in

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,650
browser programming is pretty good for

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,020
buying students way better than

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,839
programming in something else like a

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,310
command shell or something so another

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,199
one of these pictures is my course got

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,240
translated into Arabic why because

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,919
there's so much money involved in how

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,719
much money that you can make in Python

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,190
and so the University of Michigan just

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,199
went and paid a whole ton of money to

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,440
transfer make my course into Arabic and

00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:41,279
now it's on Coursera in Arabic one of

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,719
the other things that when you're

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,800
teaching at scale all people all over

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,000
the world is you have to become the

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:52,170
entire university you are the your the

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,830
advisor your the registrar your

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,540
graduation York

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,100
counseling for how to get a job you do a

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,990
lot of things and so in my course I

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,300
sprinkle all these things that you think

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,950
that you get from something other than

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,570
the classroom in an educational

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,310
situation about how to get a job

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,080
recommendations I make little videos

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,910
about what you should do next now that

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,500
you've finished this class you should go

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,940
to a Python meetup you should do this

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,160
you should do that you should do these

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,900
other things so even have a graduation

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,180
where I had a graduation speaker but

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,500
it's an online thing and so it's 5:00

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,730
and I said you get five minutes to talk

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,200
because this is online you're not gonna

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,970
get to talk for a long time so there's

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,060
Kurt bonk from Indiana University who's

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,680
a technology education guy and and I've

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,800
had students that call me and they tell

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,480
me that they cry at their graduation

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,310
because they've never been to a

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,900
graduation in their life and I play pomp

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,430
and circumstance and I dress up with a

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,110
funny hat and we give a little speech

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,940
and they said it's the only graduation

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,230
that they ever have done in their life

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:54,870
or ever expect to be able to do so it

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:57,520
took off I started that class in 2014 we

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,230
celebrated when I taught more Stu had

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,030
graduated more students across all my

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,980
classes than would fit in the University

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,690
of Michigan football stadium which is a

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,840
hundred and eleven thousand and I taught

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,980
112 so the PR people took me into the

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,090
stadium and took a bunch of pictures

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,350
with congratulations to to my hundred

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,050
and twelve thousand five hundred

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,560
eighty-five students that's now three

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,470
years ago

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:25,180
yeah well that's okay now into every

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,390
life and every story a little rain must

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,800
fall so one of things of course Sarah

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,450
did for their first three years is they

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,560
had a double bottom line of social

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:38,290
social social a pro social agenda as

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,030
well as making money and when their

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,740
venture capitalists were tired of the

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,270
pro social agenda after three years they

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,440
decided to tell Coursera to make money

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,720
so there was a little battle between

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,520
those of us who'd helped build Coursera

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,550
and Coursera itself and you can see some

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,690
articles Coursera does you can see some

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,410
articles where I talk about all this

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,060
stuff where I I never got into Coursera

00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,470
to make money right the University of

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,330
Michigan never got into Coursera to make

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,860
money we just thought this was the part

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,060
of our job as a public university to

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,800
make the world a better place and of

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,060
course Sarah wanted because my course is

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,570
one of the most popular courses that

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,030
they taught

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,100
wanted to put it behind a paywall and it

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,050
took about a year and a half of shouting

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,760
- before I let them put it behind a

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,020
paywall and what I did was in that year

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,150
and a half of shouting I created a

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,070
complete copy of the course that I made

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,370
complete open educational resources with

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:27,490
Creative Commons videos open source and

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,320
the day I rolled this out is the day I

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,140
let they put my course behind a paywall

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,420
and I told them my teaching assistants

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,670
will tell every student who complains

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,830
about the paywall about the free version

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,000
and they said I don't care as long as

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,070
you don't have to put it in the course

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,750
description you know they it's like so

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,100
that at least they have to walk in hit

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,870
the paywall get pissed and then we'll

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,460
tell them about the free version it

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,560
literally is I built my own MOOC

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,590
platform it's all open educational

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,210
resources there are learning platforms

00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,720
that just download all my stuff and

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,580
there's like a place in India and a

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,340
place in Korea a little learning

00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,590
platform with 4,000 10,000 students they

00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,000
take my stuff I'm the teacher but it's

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,430
all Creative Commons that's what oh we

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,490
are is supposed to be and of course Jeff

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,760
gave me open education resources is the

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,160
is the foundation of all this stuff so

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,720
I've got a textbook and it's been

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,030
translated into a bunch of languages and

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,990
I have Jeff Jeff and Alain to thank for

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,970
that because long before it was cool

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,250
Jeff because of the fact that their book

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,650
was built in the sort of the the

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,300
incubation of the Python open-source

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,010
community they decided they would make

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,950
an open-source book before Creative

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,620
Commons even existed and that's the book

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,960
that I forked and made and it's now in a

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,540
bunch of languages and this is probably

00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,760
the leading Python textbook in the world

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,920
not for computer scientists and that's

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,290
why it's about information I've always

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,030
felt that looking at data about people

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,590
is a far more motivating thing than

00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:01,150
solving the Queen's problem using

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:03,910
recursion so I am at this point like a

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,400
publisher I am using this this platform

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,710
that I have of millions of students to

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,780
try to promote Python even more broadly

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,860
and push it even farther so I'm probably

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,160
the only teacher that you can

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,990
binge-watch on Amazon Prime I make a

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,910
total of twenty-one dollars a month on

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,530
average from Amazon Prime so it's not a

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,310
very lucrative thing but part of my

00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,740
whole thing about

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,300
being everywhere and making it so no

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,629
matter where you turn it any search box

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,129
you type Python I want to come up first

00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,360
another thing that I do is on Python for

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:33,939
everybody I have what I call the

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,920
University of dr. Chuck and these are

00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,389
the students there's 4,000 of them but

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,189
there's more like 10,000 that haven't

00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:40,300
put themselves on a map these are the

00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,740
students that have enrolled in the

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,269
University of dr. Chuck

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,490
they don't enroll in Coursera they don't

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,379
ruin the University of Michigan I have

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,879
my own MOOC hosting platform that I

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,910
built from scratch which is also open

00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:55,720
source it's written in PHP at least for

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,189
the next year so yeah I know i I've come

00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,990
to the light I've come to the light I'm

00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:01,990
coming to the light you'll see a happy

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,220
ending here at the end and I also

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,050
probably have about a hundred and fifty

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,550
courses around the world and so if

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,350
you're familiar with Pearson's MyMathLab

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,999
what I want to be is I want to be the

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,110
MyMathLab for Python I want to have a

00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:16,089
book that is a free book 999 and I want

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,470
to have a website that has got all the

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,579
content all the backing material if you

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,870
want to do a flipped classroom it's

00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,069
right there for you and it plugs into

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,660
the learning management system whether

00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,240
it's Moodle or canvas or Sakai or

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,730
blackboard and I have about 150 classes

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,629
that have adopted my doctor Chuck's

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,370
Python MyMathLab and and the difference

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:34,480
between me and Pearson is everything is

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,160
free and everything's Creative Commons

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,839
and there's no cost even to use my

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,259
servers I didn't even charge like lumen

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,990
charges that this is the thing that I

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:44,769
didn't expect when I started teaching

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,639
Python

00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:51,579
I thought Python was a good language for

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,290
beginners but then no grown-ups would

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,120
ever use Python and so the whole purpose

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,410
of Python was to teach you so that I

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,439
could teach you a real programming

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,230
language like PHP so that when you grow

00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:04,779
up you use like PHP or something like

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,290
Java that's what grown-ups use right and

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:12,009
that's how I felt in 2008 I was

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,779
tremendously wrong Pike I wrote in a

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:16,059
Cora article called what's the next big

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,220
thing in Python and briefly summarized

00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:19,809
is what I think the next thing big thing

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,639
in Python is Python is literally going

00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:23,679
to eat every programming language and

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,509
spit it out and destroy it meaning that

00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,160
we've never seen in the history the

00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:31,379
40-year history of computer science a

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,639
language that is more unintentionally

00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,110
aggressive towards other languages in

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,710
the fact that it's destroy

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,340
other things so it turns out that

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,720
teaching Python is very lucrative I

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,730
could have a couple of Tesla's if I

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,920
wanted I could have a new house but I

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,230
decided to take up auto racing instead

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,550
so I have a race car so if those of you

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,440
saw I'm gonna be demonstration showing

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,230
my race car in Detroit in a little bit

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,420
and the race car is run by open source

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,760
racing with a Coursera logo and a Sakai

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,500
logo and so the whole thing is this joke

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,990
about open source that make us it looks

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,550
like a cool race car so I want to talk

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,280
in the last four minutes that I've got

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,290
about where I'm gonna take this I see

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,710
this world now from almost a perspective

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,970
of I'm Pearson right so the next class

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:21,700
I'm repenting I'm repenting my five

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,190
years of dalliance with PHP I have a

00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,340
whole Coursera specialization called web

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,250
applications for everybody in PHP and

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,810
it's very popular but it ain't gonna be

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,370
it's not as popular as this one's gonna

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,110
be when I'm done with it and so that I'm

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,580
gonna have a specialization on Coursera

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,190
called Django for everybody I just

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,540
finished teaching a Django course at the

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,790
University of Michigan it's got Auto

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,010
graders and it's got Creative Commons

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,200
open-source software you know the drill

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,080
right so I expect to have this on

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,950
Coursera kind of a little less than a

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,600
year from right now

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,490
Coursera tells me that the most

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,550
searched-for term on Coursera is Python

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,600
the most searched-for term for a course

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,940
that they don't have is Django so I

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,089
think jangles gonna be a kind of big

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,320
deal pretty soon although this is one of

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,000
the things that I'm actually most proud

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,160
of and this started in January and it's

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,770
the thing that I can I'd love to if we

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,500
had sprint time to talk about this I've

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,970
been contacted by a series of liberal

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,770
arts schools about a hundred of them

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,270
that want to add technology to their

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,650
curriculum in a way that doesn't harm

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,540
the liberal arts schools and destroy

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,860
them there's often computer science and

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,050
liberal arts meet and then one of them

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,880
dies usually it's liberal arts and so

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,450
I'm trying to build a way that you can

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,370
take a fashion student or a or a writing

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,050
student and make them like technology

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,570
and teach Python so I have a whole

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:46,000
different curriculum I have a whole

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:47,620
different an idea of it is not just to

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,950
make it a technology class but to make

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,480
it a technology plus a thinking

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,550
critical thinking about technology so

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,080
you spend time reading books about

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,760
technology and arguing and debating

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,840
about technology and wondering about

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,490
technology and wondering about

00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,990
artificial intelligence and oh by the

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,730
way this week we're also going to teach

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,410
you if statements along with all this

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,760
cool reading that you're doing and the

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,830
whole goal of this will I'll be

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,300
successful if I'm if it means that

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,070
liberal arts schools do not have to add

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,570
any faculty literally I can take

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,950
somebody from the writing department and

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,300
have them teach the Python course and

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,740
bring the writing into the Python course

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,060
take somebody from the physics

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,230
department have them teach the Python

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,170
course which means I got to teach them

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,820
how to do Python and then give them

00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:27,050
enough materials so that it's really

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,430
easy and this is my secret plan and I

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,300
hear a lot this morning talking about

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:35,030
this and that is I really am not excited

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,770
about the way high school most I'm

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,030
really not excited about Willy 99% of

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,650
high schools teach computing and

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,290
computer science I think it's terrible

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,700
to be honest so I'm building slowly but

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,140
surely because high schools are a tough

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,210
nut to crack we've heard that a bunch of

00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,710
times this morning I figure the only way

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,690
that I can help high schools is if I can

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,970
build a whole curriculum with a whole

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,960
set of books and a whole set of

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,340
supporting materials and then high

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,900
schools will find their way to it as

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,520
compared to me going and banging on high

00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,990
school doors saying I got this great

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,060
idea and that's where liberal arts

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,310
colleges are easier to get into than

00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,680
high schools or to get into but I

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,440
basically have this entire curriculum

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,220
that is intended to be a scratch to AP

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,650
computer science curriculum and happy to

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,590
talk with people about that and so

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,750
here's the moment of Inception so my

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,850
whole career has been in building open

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,090
source educational technology and that

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,500
is how I teach but the thing that really

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,000
is going to be the greatest joy in my

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,220
life and this would be another thing we

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,170
could do a sprint on is this as a django

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,630
application that can plug into canvas

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:39,980
that can send grades back to canvas in

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:42,320
20 lines of code the inception moment is

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,500
I am creating the world's largest Python

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,730
program class to teach to build have

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,790
students go into the world's largest

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,200
Django class to then create hundreds of

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,630
thousands of people who can build new

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,700
educational technology applications so

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,970
that we can teach just anything that we

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,970
want

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:07,330
thank you very time

00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:07,330
