Title: Tracy Teal, Dr. Kari L. Jordan - Inclusive pedagogy to support computational teaching - PyCon 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: PyCon 2019 - Educational Summit
Description: 
	"Speakers: Tracy Teal, Dr. Kari L. Jordan

How we teach, rather than what we teach, often has the most impact on who participates and on learning outcomes. This presentation covers trends in computational teaching, and focuses on how these trends relate to diversity, inclusion, equity, and access to computational training. Through the lens of The Carpentries, an organization dedicated to teaching foundational coding and data science skills worldwide, we present best practices and opportunities for improvement in computational teaching pedagogy. Evidence-based teaching practices, “train-the-trainer” programs, and mentoring are three strategies we outline that support inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching. We describe and discuss effective teaching practices that promote inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching, including formative assessment, collaborative note taking, a strong commitment to a Code of Conduct, and creating a welcoming environment for learners.

Oh yours Tracy all right well thank you

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,160
so much I am super excited to be here

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,190
and I really appreciate the opportunity

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,769
to speak with this group as Meg says

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,630
this is such an amazing crowd of people

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,100
who are already excited about this and I

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,500
think what's really great about the

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,320
people that are excited about education

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,810
is that teaching is leadership at the

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,369
front of the room so we have a bunch of

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,189
teachers and we have a bunch of leaders

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,380
in this group that are interested and

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,469
excited to make an impact in their

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,870
communities oops

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,809
okay so yeah so this is what I'm going

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,879
to talk about today and I I work with

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,510
the carpentry zhh but I used to teach

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,980
swimming and so when I thought swimming

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,809
you actually can learn to teach swimming

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,350
it's a 40-hour course through the

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,940
American Red Cross and when we learn to

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,800
teach living you know walk through

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,020
there's certain things that everyone

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,699
needs to know about swimmingly put your

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,129
face in the water put your head under

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,530
the water kick your feet move your arms

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,530
the kind of core skills are not

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,689
overwhelmingly complicated so what we

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,850
talk about is how to introduce those

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,869
goals what order to introduce them how

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,360
to work with the people in the pool

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:21,630
adults to children and so when we talk

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,770
about learning to swim this is never how

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,750
we approach it where you whack someone

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,280
to the edge of the pool and you push

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,619
them in the deep end right does this

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,750
person obviously this is not that

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,619
scenario come back to swimming lessons

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,930
the next day

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,549
would we expect that to happen if we

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,220
took someone who didn't know how to swim

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,460
and threw them in the deep end

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:50,880
probably not instead what we're taught

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,939
is that we want to support people in

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,310
their learning we want to be there with

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,200
them we want to provide guidance we want

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,460
to introduce things at an appropriate

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,790
level but yet somehow when we move into

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,860
the computational realm we forget some

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,970
of these things that we know about

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,700
learning and we sort of throw people in

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,730
the deep

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,370
and not because we think that that's

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,950
what we should do necessarily but maybe

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,870
we've forgotten what it was like to

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,640
learn to swim what the deep end looks

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,099
like maybe we don't know how to

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,959
introduce things in the right order how

00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,840
to create the environment for our

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,530
learners and so in swimming really

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,140
motivated to do it this way rather than

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,930
the other way because actual drowning

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,670
has a lot of bad implications it's not

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,319
quite as obvious when we're teaching

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:51,519
someone coding so what we see is that

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:54,819
how we teach is as important as what we

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,799
teach right same things in swimming but

00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,650
one person is never getting in the water

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:02,620
again and another person can go through

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,720
the steps to learn to swim and so we

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,910
talk about bringing compute to data

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,920
maybe in this conference we'll have a

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,260
lot of that compute the data or data to

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,900
compute but what we need to do is we

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,859
need to bring people to data and to

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,450
software because we want to empower all

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:22,900
people culturally and linguistically

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,060
diverse students to use data in software

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,280
to answer questions that are important

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,769
to them by having more people who have

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,690
these skills and these perspectives we

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,510
have more opportunity to answer

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,820
questions in science and society and for

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,799
these people themselves most of all to

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,769
feel empowered to do the things that

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,410
they want to do and I took Meg's

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,930
statement here I like that access counts

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,820
right access for everyone to be able to

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,500
learn these things is important and when

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,750
we're thinking about that framework and

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,670
this is what meg was saying too it's

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,650
really important that we consider how we

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,620
teach if we want to bring these to

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,769
everybody so I'm going to be talking

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,420
about some of these elements from the

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,430
perspective of the carpentry so the

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,130
carpentry is a nonprofit organization

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,920
and we're an open global community

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,600
teaching researchers and librarians the

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,609
skills and perspectives to turn data

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,680
into knowledge and we do this through

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:21,239
our curriculum our instructor training

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,239
program and our community

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,020
and so what we realized in the kirpan

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,820
trees we started out teaching skills and

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,039
more we taught the more we realized that

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,190
the most important thing to select for

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,410
is confidence and self-efficacy then we

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,210
teach short format workshops two days in

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,860
two days we're not necessarily going to

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,660
be able to we definitely can't teach

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,550
everything but at the end of the two

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,440
days it's not as important if you know

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,080
exactly how to write a lot of syntax

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,449
then if it's you have now the confidence

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,760
to continue learning that you have some

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,229
ability to keep learning yourself that's

00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,510
the thing that's going to keep you going

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:03,910
on your exciting coding path and so

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,699
what's really great is in having this

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,100
mentality there's already a lot work of

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,680
work done in this space and educational

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,139
pedagogy and culturally responsive

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,300
teaching that can help guide our

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,710
practices so when I talk about the

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,650
things that we're doing these are things

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,330
that come from from the literature from

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,270
research that can help guide our

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,169
practices so we still have more to learn

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,940
but this is where we are right now so

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,270
these are two great resources I would

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,190
highly recommend both of these books and

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,340
the other amazing thing is that in the

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,800
carpentry 's we have about 2,000

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,050
volunteer instructors and so these

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,550
instructors too are contributing to all

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,919
the ideas that I'm going to talk about

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,419
today through their teaching through

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,940
their learning they're contributing to

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,270
our instructor training to our materials

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,370
talking to each other in the community

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,199
so we have a really rich resource that

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,840
contributes to these ideas and people

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,560
passionate about teaching people and

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,780
learning coding skills and so all of

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,460
this is incorporated into our instructor

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,830
training program it's also a two-day

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,139
program that highlights a lot of these

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,080
things that I'm going to talk about and

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,330
all is this is all open source or cc-by

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,949
so you can check out our materials too

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,760
and if it's some of these things seem

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,800
interesting ok so I'm going to focus on

00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,930
when we talk about how we teach three

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,909
out sort of concepts and then some of

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,550
the things that we do within each of

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:34,889
these concepts

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,060
so the first is creating the classroom

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,120
community

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,330
the second is talking about productive

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,590
struggle and then finally assessment for

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,870
learning so creating the classroom

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,370
community or a container for learning so

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,650
sometimes you hear the phrase we need to

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,050
create the container for learning what

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,939
space is someone walking into where

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,009
they're going to learn so if someone is

00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,479
walking in feeling insecure maybe the

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,340
first way they learned it is being

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,020
pushed in the deep end of the pool if

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,939
that's how they're feeling you need to

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,779
create a space where they can feel safe

00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,250
to learn to try to fail so every person

00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,800
needs a place that is furnished with

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,370
hope you want people to be hopeful when

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,409
they walk in that room

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,479
okay so just as an example so who in

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:22,979
this room has been in a course or

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:28,889
workshop where they felt like they

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:31,050
didn't belong and then how many people

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:36,449
then left that topic for a while or

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:39,389
maybe even forever so that space that

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,250
sense of belonging impacts that content

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,440
you can think to yourself if you've now

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,379
come back to that subject is it because

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,729
you were incapable or was it because it

00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,419
was your first day that your first

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:53,940
experience with that topic so how we are

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:57,419
taught has such an impact on what it is

00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,900
we decide that we can learn so what do

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:04,860
we do in the carpentry to create this

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:09,319
classroom community so I'm just gonna

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,639
highlight five things and so the first

00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,490
introductions is connecting with your

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,229
learners so when you're creating this

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,270
space the learner wants to know that

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,029
they can trust you that they're your an

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,949
advocate for them so we have a whole

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,719
sort of introductions to introduction so

00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,990
how you introduce yourself as an

00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:30,180
instructor has a big impact and I'll do

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,269
a quick example so I could introduce

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,430
myself to different ways to this group

00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,380
or let's say you're a classroom I could

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,440
say hi my name is Tracy I've been

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,180
working in bioinformatics for 20 years

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,919
my favorite thing to do is work out the

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,829
Linux command line and can

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,470
shooters are awesome so let's go do you

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,050
feel like I'm going to connect with you

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,240
necessarily or I could say hi my name is

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,790
Tracy I've been working in biology for

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,339
20 years I've been able to use some

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,190
computational approaches and it really

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,139
was exciting what I what that let me do

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,060
and I'm really excited to be here today

00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:09,120
to share some of those skills with you

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,100
and so that we can all work together to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,430
learn computational approaches in

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,860
biology which one thinks has you

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,230
thinking that I'm on your side right so

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,740
it does start with a second I hope maybe

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,230
the first depends on the audience right

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,690
so that's something to know right who's

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,160
your audience what's gonna help you

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,709
connect with them what part of your

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,910
experience is gonna help you to connect

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,010
with them and I think that's actually a

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,170
really great and amazing thing about

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,899
being a teacher is that you bringing

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,500
your whole self to that teaching makes

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,269
you a better teacher so sharing that

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,329
parts those parts of you can be really

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,130
powerful our code of conduct so

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:52,140
carpentry has a code of conduct and

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,600
enforcement guidelines and so we always

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,370
share that upfront that we have a code

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,440
act that we have certain expectations

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,850
for how the teacher is going to interact

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,860
with the students and how the students

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,430
should interact with each other and when

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,260
we make those expectations clear we also

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,149
give the students an opportunity to

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,560
connect with each other this isn't just

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,589
a dynamic between the person at the

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,670
front of the room and the people sitting

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,829
there it's a dynamic between the

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,600
students as well so we say we don't like

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,820
a quiet classroom we like the students

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,709
learning from each other partly because

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,319
they can see each other's struggle a

00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,880
little bit but they can learn from each

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,500
other and they can teach each other

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,060
sometimes they may think they don't know

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,220
something but they actually teach the

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,839
person next to them so we have students

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,050
just take a minute and introduce

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:44,100
themselves to each other and just you

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:46,740
say what's your name describe your

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,740
research in three words or less and name

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,329
one thing you're proud of that you made

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,800
so it just provides something a little

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,630
bit interesting that's that's one

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,450
example for a quick introduction and

00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,410
that makes a really big impact on the

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:04,120
Oh of the workshop accessibility Hyden

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,980
highlighting upfront how people can

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,750
access the materials in a variety of

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,209
different ways so in terms of

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,010
accessibility this is a place where we

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,470
have improvement and it also reminds me

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,910
that I forgot to turn on the captions

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:21,769
here let's see they're telling people up

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,579
front see I'm using the Google captions

00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,579
we're going to see how it goes

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,269
so but telling people up front how they

00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,910
can access materials instead of having

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,910
to have people at ask for them because

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,100
sometimes people don't necessarily know

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,920
that they have different ways of

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,570
learning or access challenges and so

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
being up front with the weight different

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,040
ways that people can access the

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,310
materials is important and then finally

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,199
studying expectations for learning so

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,310
we're gonna be in this course you're

00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,290
gonna be learning a lot of new things

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,820
things are gonna be challenging you

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,250
might not get it right the first time

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,110
that's okay we're working through this

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,140
together here's where we're starting

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,850
here's where we're gonna end up so it's

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,920
not a mystery around what you're going

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,630
to learn and also setting the stage for

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,010
the idea that you know that they're

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,199
going to struggle and that that's

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,199
expected and that's part of the learning

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,810
okay so productive struggle so we're in

00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:24,560
the workshop everyone's excited to be

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,660
there and so this I think I can a lot of

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,149
people that walk into training around

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,089
coding are disempowered they feel like

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,980
it's something they can't do so it might

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,390
be that we're not rebuilding we're just

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,640
building in the first place but a lot of

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,100
times I am talking sorry about adult

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,810
learners throughout this rebuilding that

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,000
I think I can't attitude begins with

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,670
helping these students achieve small

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,790
incremental success on important tasks

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,069
and both of those things are important

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,889
success as small successes and important

00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:57,470
tasks if people are having successes on

00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,800
things they view as toy problems they

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,019
don't feel as accomplished so how do we

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,269
embrace productive struggle in our

00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:08,060
workshop first in that introduction by

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:10,040
saying you're going to struggle but we

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,190
have the active learning so you have to

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,350
try

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,500
as a part of the struggle you can't just

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,210
peer it I like also in swimming you

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,340
don't teach swimming by having everyone

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,590
sit on the pool deck and show them a

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,570
PowerPoint presentation right that would

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,700
not be very effective so the same thing

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,880
here get them in the pool get them in

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,800
their computer and so when we teach when

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,110
we're at the front of the room the

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,690
instructor is coding and the students

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,480
are coding along with the instructor and

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,190
so it gives people an opportunity to try

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,120
things out together so we're not just

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:48,500
showing we're working together we use an

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,390
AI we you model of teaching so I

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,610
introduced the topic we work on it

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,280
together and then you try it on your own

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,430
so again that has that incremental

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,410
element to it where you see it then we

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:06,000
do it together and then you get to try

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:08,280
it on your own and also meg highlighted

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,200
this a lot as well reframing mistakes as

00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,820
learning so we say the mistakes are the

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,050
pedagogy so when you're in the

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,230
instructor at the front of the room in

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:21,000
your live coding you make mistakes so

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,890
many mistakes and so it's a real

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,050
opportunity one to show that you are

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,690
human and that you make mistakes right

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:30,600
and it's also an opportunity to show how

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,580
you recover from those mistakes so we

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,180
want people to be able to learn how to

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,830
recover and so the mistakes are the

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,240
learning for the instructor at the front

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,270
of the room when they tell you that you

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,930
forgot whatever it is you forgot or type

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,390
the same thing wrong for the third time

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,310
but they themselves have that process of

00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,220
seeing where they make a mistake and

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:57,450
using that to learn rather than thinking

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,640
of it as a failure relevant examples so

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,740
in software carpentry data carpentry

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,080
library carpentry we are primarily

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,660
working with researchers in librarians

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,990
and so all of the examples that we use

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,910
are relevant to the people's research

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,770
context so they're working with the

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,690
system they're already familiar with so

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,580
they already have a framework that

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,290
they're interested in and understand and

00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,120
so the examples come from that so

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,390
they're building coding onto a framework

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,000
that they already have

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,440
and then it's also motivational because

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,970
those are problems that they want to

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,940
solve they want to go back to their lab

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,550
back to their library and solve those

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,370
problems and so using relevant examples

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,990
helps them feel it is productive they're

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,150
doing something that they would do in

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,400
their daily work and then finally

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,670
immediate feedback and help

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,650
so struggling on your own is not very

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,720
valuable you do need that someone to be

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,970
able to step in and say oh here you know

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,740
here's where we could do something

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,100
differently so it does need to be

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,380
immediate and so in all of our workshops

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,210
we have two instructors and then we have

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,580
helpers in our workshops so we have

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,500
about a five to one ratio so the helpers

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,360
can come and help people individually

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,790
when they're struggling with challenges

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,680
finally assessment for learning so often

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,790
we think about assessment as sort of

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,890
taking a test and it's very stressful

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,830
but we actually can use assessment as a

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,440
way to think about learning and so our

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,750
favorite version of formative assessment

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,610
its formative assessment so assessment

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,600
during the workshop and we use sticky

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,070
notes so if you have our we do an

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,780
exercise we say when you're done with

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,240
the exercise put up a green sticky note

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,060
on the front of your computer and if

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,220
you're having trouble put up a pink

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,930
sticky note and someone will come help

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,580
you so that helps the learner see that

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,800
they can get some help and also helps

00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,030
the instructor know when the class is

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,190
having challenged so if you see a sea of

00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,160
pink sticky notes you know you need to

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,100
reacquaint our concept we have the

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,079
exercises as I mentioned and then our

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,480
survey designed to build confidence so

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,850
we did put some questions in our survey

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,260
around skills and the feedback was that

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,490
people had a great experience in the

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,079
workshop and then they went and took

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,240
those questions at the end and they felt

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,790
like they failed and was it most

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,520
important that we knew whether or not

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,350
they had learned exact syntax or was it

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,690
more important around that self-efficacy

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:29,320
in that confidence so it's influenced

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:32,110
how we do our survey design so what we

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,270
believe about belonging that community

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,539
our effort that productive struggle and

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,669
the value of the

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:42,559
ask leads to the engagement and the

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:44,389
motivation so this is just a big recap

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,639
of all these things and I did highlight

00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:48,499
some of the things that we do but the

00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:50,029
concept is really important what's so

00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:52,460
amazing about our community is they're

00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,619
always exploring and learning about

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,359
different ways to implement these things

00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,950
in the classroom and so actually how

00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,799
many carpentry instructors are in the

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,570
room yeah so feel free to reach out to

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,570
any of these folks - to learn more about

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,970
some of these things ok so I'm going to

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:12,440
quickly go just through some outcomes so

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,999
does this work so one is scales we have

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,529
a lot of instructors I talked about our

00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:18,440
instructor training that gives a lot of

00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,869
people the ability and interest to go

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,759
teach workshops so we teach them all

00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:28,820
over the world but mostly does it

00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,970
improve confidence so when we see just a

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,460
pre imposed workshop of two days we can

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,320
see that things like confidence and

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,299
programming and at the bottom and

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,309
overcome problem in the middle there's a

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,259
full point difference in just two days

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:46,629
and people's perception of they're

00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:48,559
confident of what they can do this work

00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,809
and these are the kinds of things they

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,580
say about the workshop and this

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:54,679
confidence persist long term so when we

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,899
do a survey six months more after the

00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,179
workshop almost a hundred percent of

00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:01,279
respondents say I am more confident now

00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,679
which is surprising to me because the

00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:08,239
more I use Python the less confident I

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,129
feel actually and that people have seen

00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:12,049
this as value they have highly recommend

00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:15,529
these workshops is something they see as

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:17,929
having a positive impact and then they

00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,729
go on to continue learning which is the

00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,440
other thing that we want to see right

00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:24,970
that they had that self-efficacy they're

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,970
going on to continue learning

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,300
so these are a few different ways that

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,250
would continue to learn and I think as

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,920
we talk about the Sprint's we'll see

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:41,550
that there's lots of opportunities so

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,200
just kind of as a bit of a wrap-up when

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,050
we talk about how we teach it's how

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,370
people feel and so Maya Angelou I've

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,020
learned that people will forget what you

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,400
said people forget what you did but

00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,620
people will never forget how you made

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,690
them feel and that's what we have the

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,780
opportunity to do in our workshops to

00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,690
inspire people to Z skills and keep

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,910
using them in in their work and in their

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,580
lives to do amazing things and feel

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,050
awesome about their capabilities so I

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,820
want to thank the amazing carpenters

00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,250
community that does all of this work and

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,140
the opportunity we have here in this

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,480
summit something we take the heart is if

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,179
you want to go fast go alone if you want

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,220
to go far go together in this community

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,250
is great at coming together to work

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,740
towards shared challenges so thank you

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:31,529
very much

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,529
