yes thank you okay so this is the

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,269
wrap-up session for the mini sprints we

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,429
had I think like coming in like 1 2 3 4

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,759
7 different clusters of people working

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,100
on stuff I'm gonna report out first

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,390
because I was in one as well and then we

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,850
have a line of people who are gonna do

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,580
one in two minute report outs of what we

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,820
did in our cluster so in my cluster we

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,760
had two mini sprints um one was mine on

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,149
making worksheets around Python syntax

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,680
and other sort of drill education things

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,809
that we need in from a language

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,270
standpoint and then we also had make

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,500
some ogres they get that right I hope I

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,260
did cool got a thumbs up um can you yell

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:52,949
the name of your website unlocked

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:55,980
edu unlocked dot edu in fact unlocked

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,370
edu org is the correct version of there

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,920
where you're trying to compile up

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,719
multiple choice questions and into a

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,510
website where you can access them and

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,740
compile them together with an API and so

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,979
we all work together to try and create

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,080
questions and um we had a great time

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,790
kind of coming up with a synth with a

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,770
format that would work for these

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,479
worksheets and what and brainstorming a

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,820
lot of what should be inside of these

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,650
workshops and really in worksheets and

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,119
questions and trying to come up with

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,770
like what are the concept model of

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,049
misconceptions that can happen in things

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,189
like functions and for loops and using

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,799
that to kind of drive some of the

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,390
content and we have repos going or at

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,189
least I do for my project you have repos

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,799
and a style guide and license and

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,200
contributor guide and a couple completed

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,939
worksheets at this point so and

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:50,180
templates worked out so I'm really

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:50,180
excited all right name and I'm done

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,090
quizzes which is essentially we're

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,070
allowing students to take quizzes using

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,229
the doctors module which is a standard

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,180
library in Python we our project changed

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,149
a lot in last few hours

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,819
initially it was going to be a web app

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,230
and now we were gonna be integrating

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,860
probably gonna be integrating

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,959
jupiter notebooks as a plug into canvas

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,959
which is a learning management system

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,510
i'm major in what we did was we worked

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,549
on kind of creating questions for the

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,950
python certification that jeff talked

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:43,379
about and that like the MTA a

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,230
ninety-eight whatever 880 water I don't

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,450
remember but 93 or whatever but anyway

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,190
that Python certification that that

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,379
people found very challenging very

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,260
difficult like it was long and just

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:58,739
tedious so we started creating questions

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,180
we have Sphinx running rune stone so

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,849
that we can just run rune stone build

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,269
and you know have those questions out

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,069
and just we write the questions and then

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,030
we can just check the questions so yeah

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,650
so what we did my name is Alex I was

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,109
working with the sensor craft group over

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,910
there like the Minecraft game one of the

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,459
biggest things he worked on was we

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,260
thought about making an installer one of

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,910
these things we thought of was a mutex

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,859
edit our implementation to make it a lot

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,730
easier because some of the people even

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,200
in that group had a hard time

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,109
downloading it and getting everything

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,120
working and so we can't really expect

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,370
kids to do that then so making it easier

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,760
for kids to download we also encountered

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,380
a Retina screen issue with Mac OS that

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,290
the game would display at a quarter of

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,169
its actual size which obviously won't

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,590
work and so we got that fixed we also

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:53,280
learned about PI games 0 which is like a

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,370
Python based game creator that lets you

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,680
create really robust code to create

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,970
games and we thought about that and took

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,440
some examples and thought of how we

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,810
could apply that to sensor craft because

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,400
we have about 900 lines but we're trying

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,620
to condense that as much as we can again

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,540
so it makes sense for younger kids we

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,949
also talked about blocky maybe making

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,840
some way that there's like an

00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,519
introduction that teaches you with block

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,349
based programming and then you kind of

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,079
trance transform into text based

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:20,699
programming against the even younger

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,210
kids can understand it and they kind of

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,860
have a less steep learning curve we also

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,000
talked about explicitly defining

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,460
prerequisites so

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,050
some big words like algorithm mapping

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,850
that type of stuff so just going through

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,380
and making sure that the kids actually

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,870
understand what we're talking about and

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,580
they're not just gonna lost and sit

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,600
quietly in the back of the classroom and

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,040
not raise their hand because they don't

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
wanna look stupid so he went there and

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,030
defined some of those things that we

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,700
assumed that the kids would know and

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,780
finally we also talked a lot about

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,250
integrating into a school setting so we

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,630
had some teachers in our group that

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,280
really wanted to use this in their

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,650
classroom but they have to use common

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,480
core and so we went through each

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,980
tutorial and thought about what common

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,320
core standard would this be hitting what

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,970
programming activity would this be

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,770
teaching the students and kind of made

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,290
it a lot easier to integrate into a

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:11,250
school curriculum whereas before there

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:14,570
wasn't explicit lessons for each

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,570
tutorial but thank you

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,360
hi I'm Gabrielle and I let a mini sprint

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,400
on creating Jupiter notebooks to help

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,200
high school students analyze scientific

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,510
data sets so we had a great group of

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,430
sprinters we had mathematicians

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,770
physicists biologists grad students

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,130
professors coders so a great group and

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,900
we split into three sub groups to work

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,570
on three different notebooks one on a

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,490
coral reef data set one on an

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,650
earthquake's data set and one on a very

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,000
difficult to work with Plant archaeology

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,460
data set so thank you for dealing with

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,550
that one and there are now three new

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,290
Jupiter notebooks in a github repository

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,030
that are open source anyone can feel

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,380
free to use them I tweeted out the

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,479
repository if you're interested in it

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,160
just let me know and they're still works

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,680
in progress but they all have a lot of

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,270
great examples of exploring a data set

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm getting some questions you can ask

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,570
about them making data visualizations so

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,830
I'm really proud of what we came up with

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,830
and look forward to seeing where it goes

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,570
hi I'm Jo me in my group we work about

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,060
developing learning activities for

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,720
teaching programming problem-solving

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:25,169
think about the challenge students have

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,700
after getting syntax and basic of the

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,790
language how a tech problem and solve it

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,500
end to end so basically we using au

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,320
Pitre notebook that start with a problem

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,849
and guide the students through solving

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,280
the problem like getting what is the

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,550
problem making design code testing and

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,530
debugging and reflecting about its work

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,750
right in a walkthrough is really tough

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,730
because I need to really design well the

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,510
path you want the student will go

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,940
through that so we took one advent of

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,530
code problem and make a design and make

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,660
up break it into an outline what is the

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,810
path we want the student to go it's

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,700
included for example reason in

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,710
explicitly about a data structure you

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,510
want to use it's also includes

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,160
strategies like simplification I don't

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,560
know to solve the original problem so

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
I'll try to solve a simplified one so we

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,330
make all of that explicit and embedded

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,090
with activities in the middle for the

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:24,060
students and I'm very very happy and

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:28,200
think it was very successful hi my name

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,360
is Ariel I was leading a sprint mini

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,510
sprint on pair programming effective

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,090
pair programming with students so we

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,420
spent most of the time actually working

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,710
on on pairs so that we could have

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,140
experience firsthand

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,140
there were five people in the group and

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,760
well I decided to team with one of the

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,880
other person so that we could actually

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,130
have three teams in total so we spent

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,490
most of the time solving a group of

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,950
problems that I originally proposed some

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,250
issues happened on using the tool that

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:05,340
we were basically utilizing we were

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:09,600
using an online judge to solve certain

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,220
problems and getting a hang of the

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,860
online judge was a little bit of an

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,900
issue in itself but at the end every

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,750
every team actually sold at least a few

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,810
problems so they were able to have

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,630
first-hand experience on actually

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,030
working with somebody else doing the

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,910
responding roles in pepperoni which is

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,950
the driver and the navigator so at 4

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,860
o'clock we stopped and we had the

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,900
opportunity to fill in a survey an

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,870
online survey so that we could actually

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,240
have quantified the experience and then

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,370
we had a small discussion on the

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,470
personal experience that we had using

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,780
pair programming we can see that there's

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,910
still a lot of questions that we need to

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,160
to answer but hopefully we should be

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:58,290
able to have these these issues

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,860
sold or at least we'll explore them a

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,860
little bit in the coming months or or

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:17,940
the full year in the future okay thank

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:19,530
you very much raspberry pi group and I

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,160
believe initially we were trying to work

00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:26,700
on a template that would help educators

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,300
kind of set up like Marva like a

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,680
simplified way to set up raspberry pi

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,600
like an introduction just like very

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:40,770
basic stuff and I think we we decided on

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,160
a template that is on docu wiki that

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,110
would allow educators as well as

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,870
developers to contribute but kind of

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,900
bridge the gap so that educators aren't

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:56,760
overwhelmed with like the tech language

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,990
but also be able to pull lessons and be

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,170
able to translate them for their

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,430
students but without getting intimidated

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:13,650
by not knowing how to use github that

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:15,240
kind of thing great can we get a round

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:20,160
of applause for all the mini sprint

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,050
organizers and another round for all of

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,839
the participants as well providing

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:29,730
awesome help so yeah this was an

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,170
experiment to run this year and I was

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,180
really excited to get down to business

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,100
and get some stuff done I think we got a

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,790
lot of really cool stuff work done and

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,589
