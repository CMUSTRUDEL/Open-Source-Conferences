Title: Neha Gupta, Jessica Jahnke - Building a Community for Girls with Python - PyCon 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: PyCon 2019 - Educational Summit
Description: 
	"Speakers: Neha Gupta, Jessica Jahnke

We teach Python to 5th-12th grade girls, aiming to build community, build self-confidence, and help bridge the gender gap in tech. This talk offers solutions to common challenges in motivating students and community organizing.

We will share methods to increase student engagement and aid the transition to Python. We used “Unplugged” activities that complement programming fundamentals, “block-based” logic in Scratch, and the drag-to-text Python platform in Codesters. We will also share examples of leading discussions that build girls’ curiosity about technology fields, including learning about role models of top women in the industry, and learning about emerging areas in technology.

Additionally, organizing clubs for students from diverse backgrounds, with varying technical educations, can involve bridging gaps and encouraging community involvement. We’ll discuss methods of reaching families and local communities, such as open presentations, celebrations, and share some do's and don'ts from our experiences. We’ll also share ways to encourage participants to develop communication skills about their technical work and teamwork.

Women’s rights and community activism are gathering national attention, and we believe that anyone can effectively run an ongoing coding club to positively impact girls' education in their communities.

and I'm Jessica I'm a physics teacher

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:09,120
from Connecticut and I taught girls who

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:13,530
code in various different areas the

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,440
motivation for our talk and for running

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,539
a code specifically for girls is because

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,070
studies by nCWIT which is the National

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,900
Council of women in technology have

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,310
shown a variety of motivational aspects

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,980
that can be different than what

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,040
traditional classrooms tend to see one

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,000
is that women would like to see and like

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,960
the ability of technology to help them

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,910
help Society they feel welcomed when

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,350
there are a lot of projects and a lot of

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,590
collaboration as opposed to a lecture

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,640
style and they want to be able to take

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,430
risks they want to be able to make

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,030
mistakes and it's also really important

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,940
that women have accurate knowledge about

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,680
what computing careers look like these

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,050
are obviously not the only issues that

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,789
the gender gap in computing faces but

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:11,100
they are contributing factors that we

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:12,570
hope we can help with so so as many

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,010
girls get discouraged from doing

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,570
computer science as early as middle

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,070
school we really wanted to focus on

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,950
building a community for these younger

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,960
girls the we're going to talk about our

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,400
experiences so there are many many many

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,490
resources out there these are one

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
specifically that we have used some of

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,579
our goals were building a community

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,189
building self-confidence and helping

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,079
bridge the gender gap so we broke this

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,420
talk into three different parts first is

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,729
gain starting code and Python so what we

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,470
use that we found useful working with

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,180
local communities and logistics on how

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,280
we were able to successfully create a

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,049
club and then we want to prepare these

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,009
girls for a career in computer science

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,810
so we really want to build their

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,350
confidence and curiosity beyond this

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,000
code beyond this club so gain started

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,590
with code and Python so when I first

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,170
learned computer science it was a screen

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,820
it was just very typing it wouldn't work

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,920
because there was never a semicolon and

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,540
it was very there's like a really steep

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,130
learning curve so when you're trying to

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,869
get girls interested in like middle

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,789
school that's not really going to work

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,940
so you need to make programming fun for

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,819
all ages and these girls often come in

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,379
with no no

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,819
to programming they don't understand

00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,790
that the program does exactly what you

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,200
tell it to do and that's it so that's

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,639
they're definitely in struggle they

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,680
don't understand their bugs they're like

00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,090
it was there something around like what

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
do you mean a bug

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,120
they don't understand basic variables

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
some of them haven't even taken algebra

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,750
yet so that's a way that we connect we

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,459
can teach that concept but they don't

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,930
even know what that is and then

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,030
different words like control structure

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,870
program flow syntax those are all

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,310
foreign concepts to them so as I think

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,379
most of us probably know scratch is a

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,669
great resource for this it's a very user

00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,450
friendly environment it's a

00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,310
click-and-drag

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,260
so there's no typing there's no really

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,730
chance for syntax errors there's this

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,040
little sprite that will do whatever it

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,900
tells it's very colorful very user

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,760
friendly kids especially like because

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,530
you can increase you to include your own

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,750
images so they could make it about their

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,379
own room or whatever they're interested

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,449
in with scratch you can also create

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,000
pretty complex progress program so this

00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:11,859
is example of three of my girls did over

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,199
the summer they created a maze game

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,060
using scratch and here they had like a

00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,409
day where they planned the project and

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,790
then they create a minimal Viable

00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,109
Product and then they created all these

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,540
different levels and all these different

00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:26,199
complex code and this is just a small

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,939
image of it so they are a two-timer use

00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,650
control so really a pretty complex

00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:32,319
project that they had a week to do and

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,040
so scratch is great with those types of

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,560
projects other resources are like code

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,500
org so my school put on the hour of code

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,949
or students from every for the entire

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,750
school tried two different programs so

00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,519
this is just an example of Anna and Elsa

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,590
or they really like make it a game to

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,090
make also behave in certain ways they

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,310
have a lot of different examples on code

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,459
org some are like more from minecraft

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,870
there have age recommendations my

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,549
students like doing this one where you

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,810
can make a little sprite dance and it

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,519
two different music and they really

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,989
enjoyed that so it's really a lot of

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,299
opportunities for students to do

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,699
whatever they find interesting beyond

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,709
some drag-and-drop programs there's a

00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,659
variety of ways you can get kids out of

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,789
their seats and moving with technology

00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:20,889
that we found was good as far as like

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,270
bringing kids together in an

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,340
after-school program where they're not

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,940
necessarily all from the same school and

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,430
don't

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,740
each other that well right away so games

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,050
like when you're illustrating if

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,570
statements play a game of Simon Says and

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,820
they'll realize that if you do something

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,710
you do something else but not if you

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,000
don't say Simon Says do not touch your

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,750
nose that kind of thing

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,220
so another big one was variables we

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,180
found that especially with girls that

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,700
are middle school and younger teaching

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,500
variables was pretty difficult so our

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,960
favorite way of illustrating that was

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,550
with a cop a sticky note on the outside

00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,110
that has the variable name and a

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,620
crumpled a piece of paper on the inside

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,610
that has a variable value so kids had

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,610
fun with that kind of thing too

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,560
code stirs is something that Meg already

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,660
talked about and we found that it

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,580
actually works really well for

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,700
after-school programs that might have

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,530
inconsistent attendance so coasters

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,380
which you mentioned earlier has a drag

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,060
and drop element Python code as well as

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:28,570
sprites and characters that you make

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:31,360
move with the Python code so the reasons

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:35,830
that coasters worked so well we thought

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,410
is because kids can see the response of

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,660
characters right away they learn how to

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,690
fix bugs and they learn what a bug

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,370
actually is as well as because it's

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,080
individual lesson plans students that

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,120
might not show up every week or skip a

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,280
week and consistently can pick up where

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,540
they left off

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,790
it's also really great for a wide range

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,940
of instructor experience levels because

00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,770
our students our instructors range from

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,190
like professional coders and software

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:07,450
engineers to new coders so the fact that

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:09,370
every lesson has a like instructions

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,100
that students need to follow means that

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:16,750
new instructors can read the

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,460
instructions along with the students one

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,669
example of a really cool game that some

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,400
of our students made with coasters was

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:28,360
they wanted to make a environment themed

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,240
game featuring cleaning up the ocean so

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,380
this was something that they had a lot

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,960
of fun with I thought and this was

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:40,289
actually made by fifth graders

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,759
oh never mind sorry yeah the the

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,080
students had fun with this because they

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,740
were able to come up with like a Minimum

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,090
Viable Product of Oh like we want the

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,460
quiz to have at least three questions

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,699
they were able to come up with like

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,900
advanced ideas like okay we want a

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,210
advanced version of the game and easy

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,860
version of the game and it worked pretty

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,400
well for the fact that they can

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,500
customize what they want so the last

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,750
thing as far as like teaching kids

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,220
Python themselves is there's a lot of

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,740
advantages to starting with a debugger

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,210
and the spider has a great one and if

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,099
you're not able to use spider and you're

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,770
able and you have to use something like

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,570
Jupiter notebooks then Python tutor comm

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,759
will let you copy paste code in and

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,669
watch it execute which is great

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,630
especially for stuff like lists and

00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,570
pointers

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,400
it'll have actual arrows and this

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,720
resource is good if your Chromebooks and

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,720
you can't like download Python it's

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,490
available online so our club of girls

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,530
who code had a pretty wide range of

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,360
skill sets we have students on scratch

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,520
and we had students that wanted to learn

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,169
like true code because they wanted to

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,150
take AP Computer Science the next year

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,039
so what worked for us was keeping a

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,539
spreadsheet of where each student was

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:56,639
and updating it weekly the other thing

00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,469
that we had them do is we had them use a

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,560
Kanban board where they had like a to-do

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:04,650
column a doing column and a done column

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,210
so they had fun moving their sticky

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,479
notes across the board and keeping track

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,190
of their own progress as well this

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,449
helped us get ready for final

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,849
presentations which we'll talk more

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,650
about in a minute and it also allows a

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,599
lot of flexibility if you have drop-in

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,639
volunteers that are coming in for one

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,009
week then they can help a student that

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,599
they think they have knowledge about how

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,370
to help them yeah so now we'll talk

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,110
about like the other aspect beyond just

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,209
like helping students learn code the

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,039
perhaps bigger one is like getting a

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,459
community together getting the logistics

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,459
handled

00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,119
so what worked for me because I was a

00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,249
software engineer when I was looking for

00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:46,739
a community to join is that I was just

00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:49,980
googling stuff like stem tutoring in

00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:53,790
Connecticut and how to help women in

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,389
tech in Connecticut and I found I found

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,009
a local community leader who ran a local

00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:02,759
non-profit and was a retired school

00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:05,309
principal in the area that wanted to get

00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,410
more people like me and so I contacted

00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,839
her through her website that she had up

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,970
already and we met up and we started

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,829
planning people talk about local

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,149
libraries before that is where we hosted

00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,799
the club that Jessica and I worked out

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,649
together that's great because libraries

00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,049
have computers and they already have all

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:25,350
the resources that you need and the

00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:27,720
woman that I was working with had not

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,519
only some other people that she wanted

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,509
to bring in as well as some a lot of

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,220
connections within the community to

00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,889
other school teachers and recruiting

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,720
students yeah and for me to join it was

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:41,189
really really simple I had worked with

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,230
girls who code of a summer and I wanted

00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,519
to continue with it fall so I looked up

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,199
online you could do this with girls who

00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,999
code or their organizations it's just I

00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:49,110
have experience with and I found a host

00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,879
group that was within walking distance

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,059
of my apartment I was like this is

00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,100
perfect so it's really pretty easy girls

00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,569
to code I know specifically has ones all

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,129
over the country and they're expanding

00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:01,579
internationally I think to Canada and

00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:03,509
maybe some other places some other

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,549
opportunities if you can't commit to

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,499
like a whole year club is just doing a

00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:09,119
one-day workshop at a company that's a

00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:11,279
great experience for girls or for any

00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,989
students and then since I'm a teacher

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,610
one way to recruit is just to talk to

00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:16,439
guidance counsellors other teachers

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,149
students have them bring a friend to the

00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:21,869
club to try to recruit more people and

00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:25,019
just kind of get the word out there so

00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:27,959
one major part of our group was have

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:31,049
presentation so we had the girls twice a

00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,369
year show their work off to their family

00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,919
their friends and different people like

00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:36,929
that this is a great opportunity because

00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,669
girls and I think all students are not

00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,139
great at public speaking but fortunately

00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,489
you'll never public speak to more

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,110
friendly people than your family and

00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,449
friends so it's a great place for them

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,720
to try out new things they are able to

00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:49,980
show off their work and then also show

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
it off to people who might want to

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,800
join in the future so we got a lot of

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,340
new people joined just through these

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,230
things

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,520
we also encourage the older girls to

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,530
kind of help with the younger girls to

00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,940
show them how it works and then some of

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,200
our older girls were commuting from a

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,790
little bit farther to come to our club

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,860
so they actually create their own club

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,810
more locally available to them after

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,810
they saw after they tried it out with us

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,810
so our kind of one part X was trying to

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,460
prepare these girls for a part after the

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,080
club so this is building and group

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,800
community building confidence and

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:25,020
curiosity beyond the scope of this club

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,580
so one key feature is these women in

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,260
tech spotlights so I think a lot of

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,880
people especially young girls might

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,850
think that computer scientists might be

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,140
older male and white and we want to

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,950
really show them that that's not

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,590
necessarily true

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,420
so there's idea that you can't be what

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,160
you can't see so they don't have role

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,020
models that they can identify with it's

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,750
gonna be hard to get them to continue

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,520
with this career so pretty much every

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,200
lesson or whenever we had time we would

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,400
try to these women tech spotlights so

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,740
some people we talked about we're like

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,900
Ada Lovelace a famous computer scientist

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,850
from the 1800s who was one of the first

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,290
computer scientists we also wanted to

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,240
make sure that we provided a diverse

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,740
role model so this is Ayana Howard who

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,110
is a robotics engineer who helps work

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,580
with NASA so we talked about her we kind

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,010
of ran these in different ways sometimes

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,390
the girls would repair it and then we

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,100
would have a group discussion sometimes

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,750
we'd like put a name or show a video

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,130
have the girls do a little bit of

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,840
research on their own and then bring it

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,340
back to a group discussion I think

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,870
having these role models was really

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,310
important because you could see

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,600
different girls really connect with

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,810
different people that we were talking

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,490
about

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,380
yeah the benefit to those is largely

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,090
that um you have the chance to bring in

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:37,440
girls that get excited about technology

00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:39,990
even if they aren't during the course of

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,170
like six weeks to 12 weeks able to

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,880
necessarily become Python experts and

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,410
they're still just getting comfortable

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,790
with variables at least they're excited

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,340
about technology and excited about

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,040
what's to come so another big way that

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,680
we did that was incorporating emerging

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,450
areas of technology by which I

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,090
definitely don't mean like blockchain

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,290
and kubernetes I mean like stuff that

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,120
kids already know what it is

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,709
know that they need clean water and if

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,589
we're able to find a YouTube video about

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:11,050
you know a woman that works at UNICEF

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:13,060
that is helping create technology for

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,410
clean water then that's something that

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,149
they get excited about and they're able

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,949
to immediately see the ways that they

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,440
can potentially have a career that

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:23,829
impacts society and impacts other people

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:29,050
using technology so we would talk about

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:31,750
stuff like health technology design of

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,509
like heating fabrics is what that one is

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,880
and a lot of different exciting areas

00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,100
for them to be able to potentially think

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,089
of career opportunities with and think

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,470
about like new innovations with you can

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,480
also encourage the girls to bring in

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,850
their own ideas and so whatever they're

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,019
interested in my in one of my classes we

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,579
had like a whole discussion about like

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,110
self-driving cars and how we thought

00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,819
that might be good for the society or

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,990
how it might be bad to just gain their

00:13:54,819 --> 00:14:00,730
interest in it so one of the key

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,230
features of this is building a

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,060
sisterhood or building a community of

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,139
girls so beyond the coat beyond the club

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,389
they'll feel like they have people that

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,100
have their back so we tried to build

00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,139
connections in some really simple ways

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,850
so one key way is just to make sure the

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,470
girls are sitting next to each other and

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,449
not in desks farther away you really

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,190
want to encourage this collaboration and

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,690
have the girls help each other whenever

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,370
responsible so if two girls are working

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,709
on a similar assignment maybe they can

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,240
be like oh I have a question oh you just

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,800
answered that question like you just had

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,050
the same bug now you figured it out can

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,750
you help me I also encourage girls of

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,610
older ages help with younger girls so

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,170
like for one of our projects we had the

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,180
older girls build a website that then

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,529
hosted all the other girls projects

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,300
which was really cool way for them to

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:45,310
all see that they were working towards a

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:47,139
goal together we also had them and the

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,850
year by working on group projects so for

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,740
example we had three I think they're all

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,660
in middle school work on a project about

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,490
endangered species and they each

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,720
research like a panda and different

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,819
things and they had so much fun looking

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,529
at pictures and all this stuff and then

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:01,630
they each created our own project and

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:03,970
coasters and came together to show like

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,649
that endangered species are important

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,300
and they really bond it by just like

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,300
brainstorming that project as a group

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,350
um yeah so I definitely recommend like

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,960
trying to reach out to local communities

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,150
and finding ways that you can

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,990
potentially get started with a club like

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,340
this like I was at the time that I found

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,590
a local community leader to start this

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,180
with I was looking for committing like

00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,440
two to five hours a week but we also had

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,450
volunteers coming in that we're

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,980
committing like just one or two and

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,750
maybe just twice a month so there's a

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,630
wide range of ways you can get committed

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,690
to these types of like long run after

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,640
school programs or summer programs but

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,460
the biggest thing that I would say is

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,410
that like experience probably not as

00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,250
needed as long as you're willing to be

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,620
there and be encouraging and make sure

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,000
that things are fun for people too yeah

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,650
we are also really fortunate in our

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,150
group that we had people that had there

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,860
were like four or five of us who each

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,840
had different skills so like I came in

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,980
for more of an educator background niha

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,420
and some other people came for more of a

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,340
computer science background so together

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,650
we were really able to put something

00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:20,570
that the girls really enjoyed and we

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,570
felt like we could work together well

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,530
there's any questions

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,970
yeah so they're like I teach it for them

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,620
over the summer and the first week is

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,480
scratch in the second week is Python and

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,020
that is the hardest week of a seven-week

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,610
program it is so painful I would say

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,620
what you just had to do is go really

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,240
really slow so like the curriculum had

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,360
us doing like a hangman thing on the

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,650
third day and it's faster then on the

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,660
fourth day we went back and did like a

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,339
guessing game and that worked so well

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,020
and you're like Oakley you can't like

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,640
put ten lines of code there's no way you

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,410
could have done this hangman so I think

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,780
that's when you just like have to really

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,270
like slow down and be patient and that's

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,920
when like we always had helpers and you

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,440
just have them like really ready like

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,940
you got to be ready to go and help with

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,460
that so it is really a challenging thing

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,200
I think the student-teacher ratio is

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,970
really important for that as well being

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,860
able to have multitude of volunteers

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,040
even if they're just dropping in for one

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,510
time works really well and if you're at

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,040
a place where you can like broadcast to

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,330
all of your friends all of the software

00:17:52,040 --> 00:18:04,700
engineers and data scientists that you

00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:06,500
know that works really well I would just

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,530
say that like the biggest thing we would

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,480
look at would be whether or not students

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,270
wanted to return the next year as well

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,900
as like the general vibe that they had

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:20,600
because this is all up to them whether

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,620
or not they come it's not um something

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
that they have to come to it's not a

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,580
school program it's after school they

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,140
could just quit if they wanted so we

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,550
definitely consider the fact that they

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,530
kept coming back and their parents kept

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,900
dropping them off as meaning that like

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:36,170
they wanted to and their parents thought

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,580
it was valuable for them yeah yeah we

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,020
didn't necessarily do surveys or

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,670
anything like that but I'm sure you

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,630
could find some on the girls who codes

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,630
website yeah yeah

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,970
yes I just say like I think some of the

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,070
girls when they first go in there like

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,480
concern to say like oh I'm interested in

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,130
this but then they find another girl

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,690
that's like also interested in this and

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,770
they like bond over video games which is

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,330
something like they might not

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,070
necessarily feel like share because it's

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,500
not necessarily a female thing to really

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,090
enjoy so I think just like it gives them

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,650
more of a space where they can be brave

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,280
and take risks that they might not take

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,280
in other environments

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,130
