can everyone see that all right I'm hi

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,590
I'm Nina Zakharchenko some of you might

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,500
follow me on Twitter I tweet at nnj eh

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,630
that's like ninja without the eye I'm

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:30,990
here today to show you how to light up

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:33,690
your life with Python and LEDs let's try

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,880
a little bit let's try something a

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,500
little bit different today it's it's

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,210
pretty fun to live tweet so if you're

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,430
learning something new if you're excited

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,620
about what you're learning today I

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,260
encourage you to share tweet and use the

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,399
hashtag Pike on 2019 if you'd like you

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,399
can app mention me as well

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:58,620
software is something that's been with

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,270
me for a long time I used to have a lot

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,780
of creative energy when I was younger

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,380
and an interest in computers from a very

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,630
young age I thought the ability to trick

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,670
computers into doing what I tell them

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:17,490
was pretty awesome and I thought I would

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,490
have to give that up when I joined the

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:25,799
workforce or nobody would take me

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,960
seriously as a developer my first few

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,420
jobs really kind of sucked the

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,150
creativity out of me I worked for some

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,950
large corporations I worked for

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,070
enterprises and financial institutions

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,540
and my opportunity is for creative

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,210
coding faded away I fully built that

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,479
back up with open source but tinkering

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:55,350
with hardware is what let my creativity

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:57,719
truly explode it's taken me years to

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,790
reconnect with that part of myself and

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,270
relearn the lesson that I learned all of

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,560
those years ago that software doesn't

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,069
have to be serious software it could be

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,470
fun

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,180
you can use it to make code you can use

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,340
it to make art like this code right here

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,140
this is a Python version of a processing

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:23,519
sketch by Saskia Frick and hardware

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,519
doesn't have to be serious either

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,930
this is how Simone Garrett's she's an

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:39,400
incredible maker this is how she eats

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:43,060
her cereal in the mornings okay here are

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,310
some of my personal projects here's one

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,530
it's an iridescent headdress just know

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,879
that this this is our dwee no code it's

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,480
written it's basically a variant of C++

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,879
and I only recently started playing with

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,569
hardware but I also just instantly fell

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,569
in love

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,090
I've always been wary of the ephemeral

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,510
nature of software that you can't hold

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,700
it in your hand you can't touch it

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,060
hardware is different you can create a

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,939
physical manifestation of your code and

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,940
I loved the idea of LEDs of making

00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,709
really cool wearable projects I wanted

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,199
to make pretty things that fit my

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,720
aesthetic right I have pink hair and

00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:33,370
pink glittery nails and I'll show you

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:37,389
all my my glittery shoes so I wanted to

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,220
make things that looked like this the

00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,859
things that fit my aesthetic is what got

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,229
me interested in hardware and hardware

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,159
let's may be creative let's me imagine

00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:47,470
something and then bring that

00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,299
imagination to life and I haven't been

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,090
inspired by a lot of amazing shared

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:56,400
projects and documentation from other

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:59,229
makers like Becky Stern yeah

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,280
now I'm not an expert in electronics and

00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,819
I'm going to show you that you don't

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,509
have to be either but a little bit more

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,879
about me so my name is nina Zakharchenko

00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:11,859
i've been a software engineer for over a

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,689
decade I've written code for some

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:16,120
companies that you might have heard of

00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:19,239
like HBO meetup and read it

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,489
now I work at Microsoft is a senior

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,320
cloud developer advocate where my goal

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,560
is to make Visual Studio code and Azure

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,940
a pleasure to use for Python developers

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,830
if you're interested in learning more

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,540
about Python at Microsoft you can check

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,070
out this link AKMs pecan 2019 but note

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,590
that you don't have to draw all these

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:42,400
links down I will give you a copy of the

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:51,430
slides at the end a quick aside this is

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:54,400
my seventh PyCon it's a dream come true

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,110
for me too to be here on stage sharing

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:05,350
what I'm passionate about with all of

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:09,100
you so thank you all for having me and

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,660
just note that if you find these slides

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,250
on speaker deck you're just gonna have

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,900
to download them to click the links

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,000
there's a lot of links throughout the

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,560
slide even a slide for additional

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,720
resources afterwards that I won't be

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,070
going through so you'll see the link

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,910
here you'll also see the link on my

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,100
Twitter and I have some live demos to

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,280
show you today so please be patient with

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:35,200
me and of course I'm a newly minted

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,229
hardware enthusiast so earlier I

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,020
mentioned Arduino code a C++ variant and

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:44,500
showed you some of my projects the

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,410
problem here is that you know C++ it's

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,770
not easy to learn it's very error-prone

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:53,020
there's a very specific syntax if you

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,030
forget a semicolon you know it's game

00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:01,510
over and we know from experience that

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,930
Python is the opposite it's easy to

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,560
learn

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,139
it's beginner-friendly it's great for

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,419
education in fact it was announced in

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,280
January that Python is going to be part

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:16,050
of the official curriculum for high

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,050
school education in France

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:28,460
so we're at a Python conference right

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:33,830
and we want to program devices with

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:37,159
Python luckily I hope you all have your

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,210
swag bags today if you reach in them you

00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,479
should have a device that looks

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,009
something like this right

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,009
I'm going to show you how to program it

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,879
so if you look in your swag bag you'll

00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:53,380
see that and then let's see if my

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,380
hardware is coordinating today

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,080
sorry it's a little glitchy promise I'll

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,970
stop in a sec okay

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,560
can everyone see that you try one more

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,560
light that's too bright

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:48,420
and of course here you'll see my pink

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:55,350
glittery nails and my matching pink USB

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:58,070
cable just the important things right so

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,070
here is this device

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:25,630
and window I want this is the we're

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:28,620
gonna write some code here make sure

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,620
that everyone can see that

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:47,019
just a little refresh there I unplugged

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:53,380
it and plugged it back in so now you

00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:56,260
should see that up there okay so this is

00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,640
just some pretty simple hope it's

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:06,190
glitching out a bit of course it wasn't

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:10,870
doing this when I tested earlier Mia

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:13,440
unplug that and plug that back in live

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,440
demos

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:33,380
that's me all right that looks a little

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,230
bit better oh all right we're just gonna

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,180
ever gonna deal with it so this is just

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,710
some simple kind of the simplest code

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,950
that you can have here I'm going to walk

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,080
you through how this works a little bit

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,710
later but the nice thing about this is

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,580
it just shows up as a drive and I can I

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,870
can program it pretty quickly so I'm

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,120
just going to make a new color we'll

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,670
talk about this soon and then I'm going

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:08,260
to update that and let's see if that

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:11,980
works all right easy peasy

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,980
let's switch things back

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,550
okay so there are a few other devices

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,230
that run Python the Raspberry Pi 0w it's

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,610
a small development kit with wireless

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,580
and Bluetooth connectivity

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,410
there's the BBC micro bit it's a

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,529
computing device aimed at learning it

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,649
was given free to every child around age

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:42,470
11 across the UK in 2016 then there's

00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:45,290
the Adafruit m 0 and M 4 line of devices

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,800
and a lot more I'm going to be focusing

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,270
on Adafruit today I'm a big fan not just

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,320
because they sometimes send me free

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,320
hardware thank you

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,890
but because it's a woman-owned company

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,440
it's based in New York Adafruit products

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,540
are low-cost they're easy to order and

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,180
they're very well documented they have a

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,370
ton of projects up on their website this

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,320
is one of my favorite hardware platforms

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,459
it was limited edition for Halloween

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,440
last year

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:17,209
it's the hollowing it's a spooky

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,160
development kit with a color screen and

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,200
I actually have one with me if someone

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,550
would like to take a closer look so how

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,490
do we get python running on these things

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,650
well micro Python is a variant of Python

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,779
3 it's optimized for microcontrollers

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,540
and it's compact enough to fit and run

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:39,740
within just 256 kilobytes of code space

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:44,990
and 16 kilobytes of RAM that's what runs

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:47,300
on the micro bit now circuit python is

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,760
an education friendly fork by Adafruit

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,430
of micro Python since I'm going to be

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,230
showing you demos on Adafruit hardware

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,360
we're going to be using circuit Python

00:11:54,230 --> 00:12:03,709
today and most importantly both are open

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,750
source so contribute back now the the

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,610
red ones in your swag bags they come

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,260
with Python pre-installed but if you

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,880
have one from somewhere else depending

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,010
on where and where when and where you

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,200
purchased it it might not have Python on

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,360
it by default it's pretty easy to setup

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,209
there's a link to that in my slides and

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,980
it's my favorite option for an

00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:27,970
introduction to electronics and

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:31,370
programming hardware pep 206 describes

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,510
this idea of pythons battery included

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,769
philosophy

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:39,110
it says that by having a rich and

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:41,300
versatile standard library which is

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,630
immediately available without having to

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,060
make the user download separate packages

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,230
the idea is that it's helped drive

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,230
Python success

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,680
now the circuit playground Express the

00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:01,360
device in your swag bag

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,360
it doesn't actually come with batteries

00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,190
but I imagine that the same philosophy

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,050
applies it has everything that you need

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:21,260
to get started with programming hardware

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:24,100
on one board so let me give you a little

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,100
bit of a tour

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:44,240
turn this off really quick and let me

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:51,710
amp up the brightness and zoom in a

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:55,400
little bit okay so it has a circle of

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,800
RGB LEDs along the sides it has these

00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,320
two programmable buttons it has a switch

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,600
on the front right here so no that's not

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,029
a power switch this is a switch that you

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,089
can program it has a little speaker

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:12,170
right here it has a microphone there's a

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,540
light sensor temperature sensor there's

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,900
even a little accelerometer right there

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:21,970
in the middle and one of the coolest

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:25,040
features is that has a micro USB port

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,200
that's how you program it and you know

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,940
it's pretty standard it's easy right

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,279
here those of you who've worked with

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,290
hardware in the past know how annoying

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:42,410
some of the other programming options

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:45,830
might be now we've talked a little bit

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:47,690
about microcontrollers so the

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,580
microcontroller is the little processor

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,680
on that chip that does the work and

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,790
because this device is so small it's not

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,830
your laptop it it's a little bit less

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:02,150
powerful you know just just a little bit

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:04,279
but it can run in this tiny package best

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,709
of all the best thing about this is that

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,140
there is no soldering required which

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:14,750
means that it's great for kids but it's

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:16,430
also great for clumsy adults and it can

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,959
easily connect to other things with

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:24,050
alligator clips like LED strips and you

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,630
can even sew onto it with conductive

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,510
thread so an alligator clip looks a

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,380
little bit like this kind of see that

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:35,810
it's got like a little clip clip clip

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,300
and then you can you know pick an input

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,500
pin and just clip it all right like that

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:46,570
you kind of want to make sure that it's

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:46,570
on there pretty good so not this but

00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:57,889
so how do we light up these RGB LEDs

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,880
that are on the front of it that circle

00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,160
you have to know a little bit about

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,019
color theory to figure out how to get

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,980
this to work but I promise just a little

00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:11,040
bit an RGB LED is a combination of three

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,170
LEDs on one package RGB here stands for

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,380
a red green and blue take a look at the

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,420
color wheel you can produce almost any

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,449
color by combining these three colors in

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:25,709
intensity is varying from 0 which is 0%

00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:29,130
to 255 which is a hundred percent on

00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:32,970
this scale zero means that the color is

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,940
not present while 255 means its maximum

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,449
intensity so for example of blue is set

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,360
to 255 Green is set to zero and red is

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:45,389
set to zero what color will we see blue

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,190
it's exactly right and looking at the

00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:51,930
color wheel you can see well if you mix

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:57,380
red and blue then you see purple this is

00:16:51,930 --> 00:17:00,480
one RGB LED under a microscope

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,579
remember the LEDs have one tiny LED

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,459
inside of them of each color red green

00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:07,040
and blue and under it you'll understand

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,660
it better if you see it in action

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,120
because the three tiny LEDs they light

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,790
up one by one but your eye sees them as

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:19,260
one color mixes the colors for you in

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:22,470
this picture they're all off in this one

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,809
just the red LED is lit that means the

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,640
whole LED will look red you can kind of

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:31,740
tell the color of that by looking at the

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:35,220
outside ring now it's just green now

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,650
it's just blue and lastly if they're all

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,360
turned on the LED will look like an

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:44,100
approximation of white to your eye right

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,410
I'm using this technique you can produce

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,929
all the colors in between know that

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:53,040
neopixels are the a different brand for

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:56,100
these individually addressable LEDs you

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,990
might also see them called ws2812 or

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,880
there's a few other

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,620
it's there okay so how do we program it

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,290
it's a lot easier than working with

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,179
Arduino based platforms for those of you

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,429
in the room that I've tried it I feel

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:16,110
like you know I've seen a lot of AVR

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:18,900
dude errors in my day so you plug it in

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,660
with a data and charge cable this part

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,929
is very very important not all micro USB

00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,360
cables support data transfer so it has

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,580
to be a known good cable if you see a

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,160
circuit python drive on Mac OS it's in

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,380
volume circuit py you're done otherwise

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,770
here's a link to install and then you

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,559
can create or edit a code py or main dot

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,990
py file in the root directory the

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,970
important thing here is do not unplug or

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,980
reset the board before your computer

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,010
finishes writing the file to the board

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,440
or you can corrupt the drive you want to

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,390
wait until the file is done being saved

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,360
before unplugging or resetting your

00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:00,750
board there's some editors you don't

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,880
want to use a like idle and notepad that

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,830
don't write the file out right away

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,809
we'll talk about some other editors in a

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,960
moment and the cool thing here is your

00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:18,300
code runs instantly because it's Auto

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:22,050
reloaded cool right okay so let's try

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:25,309
this out let's hope my camera

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,309
coordinates with me

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:49,300
see right here just make sure everything

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,300
is in focus for you

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,610
and lock that up

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:18,920
don't want everyone in the room to feel

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:21,400
like they need glasses switch this over

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,400
real quick

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,060
okay

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,610
there we go can everyone see that

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,610
fantastic okay

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,950
make sure we get the whole thing in

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,950
there

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:58,380
brought a lot of gear to make this

00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:02,550
happen all right so very quickly let's

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,880
take a look at this uh let's see let me

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:08,880
just refresh if you have the directory

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,610
open when you unplug it and plug it back

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,400
in you can just quickly refresh with CD

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:19,230
dot I figured that out a few days ago

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,260
it's been saving my life so running tree

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:26,700
on here on this volumes circuit Qi

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:28,320
directory will see this boot out txt you

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,420
don't have to worry about that the

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:36,780
important thing here is the code py file

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:39,540
that we'll be working with so we saw the

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,130
most basic demo let's take a look at

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,130
something a little bit more interesting

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,550
going back to our kind of most original

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,370
demo I want to quickly walk walk you

00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:12,140
through this so the important thing that

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,190
we have here is importing the Adafruit

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,850
circuit playground

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:20,690
Express library you want to import it as

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,490
GPX the awesome maintainer of this cat

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,140
knee is in the room today so if you're

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:28,420
enjoying it just give her a quick round

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,420
of applause she's awesome yeah

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:37,710
and then I created my red color setting

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,389
255 for red and then 0 for green 0 for

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,429
blue I'm turning down the brightness

00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,080
here because by default it's very bright

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,549
those of you who've already plugged in

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,269
your circuit playground Express and know

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:51,229
that and the important thing here is

00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:54,029
that Walter ooh I want to loop forever

00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:56,099
you want to kind of consider this kind

00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,659
of like an animation if you just run

00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,309
your code 1 so it's going to blink red

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,009
for a second and then turn off and

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:05,549
you're gonna be like what happens so

00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:09,809
this part here is crucial and on this

00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:12,599
line line 8 I'm calling CPX pixels dot

00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:16,460
fill that's a helper method on that CPX

00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:20,549
library that fills in all of the LEDs

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:26,309
with one color so looking at our more

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:29,309
complex example again I'm importing the

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:31,440
CPX library here I'm making two colors

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,599
red and blue I'm setting the brightness

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,720
and then kind of scrolling to the

00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:41,729
interesting part so I'm going to keep

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,909
looping forever if button a that button

00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:47,309
on the left hand side let me make sure

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,720
this is oriented correctly this one

00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,570
right here if that button is pressed

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,849
we're gonna fill our circle with red if

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,349
button B is pressed the one right here

00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,599
we're going to fill it with blue

00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:00,690
otherwise we're going to fill it with

00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:04,109
black and let me quickly zoom in here so

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:07,109
that you all can see that these buttons

00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:11,399
are actually handily labeled so there's

00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:13,429
the a right there and there's the B

00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:17,430
right there

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:22,540
should we try it and see if it works

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:25,870
okay so the circuit playground library

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,600
if the button is pressed

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:31,660
CPX dot button underscore a will return

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:38,860
true otherwise it returns false so we're

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:43,090
gonna fill this with red and then we're

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,370
gonna fill this one with blue and then

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,700
when I let it go it's just off black

00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:51,430
right let's add something else let's do

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,320
a little bit of live coding let me

00:24:51,430 --> 00:25:00,790
pretend I'm Kelsey Hightower for a

00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:03,970
minute that's not what I want okay so we

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:08,740
got 0 if we want to make green it's just

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:11,830
255 for that green value and let's say

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,590
that if both buttons are pressed we're

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,590
going to make the circle green

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,480
and then of course we have to change one

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,000
more thing here make that and all Saif

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,730
okay so I've saved in the code as just

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,130
Auto reloaded so now pressing button a

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:54,190
gives us red pressing button B gives us

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:56,470
blue moment of truth and if I let you

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,950
know that one go that kind of works like

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:03,010
that so it's pretty it's really pretty

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,850
easy and pretty straightforward let's

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,850
try a few more things

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:43,230
let me see there we go

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:44,880
my refresh wasn't working now this code

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,690
is just a little bit more complicated

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,610
but really just a little bit so under

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,059
here let me move this for a sec I'm

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:58,710
importing my GPX library as before I'm

00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:00,929
importing time that's just pythons basic

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,299
time I'm setting up my red green blue

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:07,919
values like I did before setting the

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:10,890
brightness this time I'm going to define

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,220
a list of my colors and I'm going to

00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:18,799
define a color position that's the color

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:22,080
that we're currently at looping forever

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,070
now I'm going to fill in the circle with

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,570
the color at my at color position from

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,760
my colors list

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:35,940
now if button a or button B is pressed

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,500
increase the color position by one using

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:42,299
the modulo operator

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:45,360
if that value is increased to more than

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,549
the length of my list using modulo will

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,820
help me wrap that value around back to

00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:54,570
zero so I don't get any indexing errors

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:57,000
and I'm going to sleep for just a fifth

00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,700
of a second here to make the button a

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,590
little bit less sensitive in programming

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,419
hardware this concept is called

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:16,620
debouncing oh no and that's also

00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:20,160
debouncing okay so based on this code

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:23,370
and the list at line 10 which let me

00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:29,700
kind of scroll that for you what color

00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:33,990
should I see next green okay and next

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:37,380
well oops that's why we need to bouncing

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:42,269
okay blue and then what what color is

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:46,049
next right right just looping back

00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:50,510
around dude okay so let's make the zoo

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:50,510
something a little bit more interesting

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,110
let me copy a different file here

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:15,700
and let me refresh that so I'm going to

00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:17,740
add some more interesting colors to my

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,129
code because we've been looking at a lot

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:31,950
of red green blue it's pretty basic

00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:31,950
right let me jiggle it see if that helps

00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,100
if that doesn't work I'm going to take

00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:45,830
the tried-and-true position of turning

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:49,070
it off and turning it back on so we have

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:52,460
our color wheel here on the left did not

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:55,040
want to zoom in to that quite so big but

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,809
here we go and I'm gonna I have some

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,150
commented out code here so that I don't

00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,309
have to remember the color wheel live on

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,830
stage so I'm going to make some new

00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:06,500
colors I'm going to make yellow which is

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:11,350
a mix of red and green right so now I'm

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:14,090
setting 255 her red 255 for green and

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,610
zerah for blue I'm gonna make a cyan

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,710
color so looking at the color wheel here

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:21,950
that's mixing green and blue and then

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:27,590
I'm gonna make a purple color mixing red

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:35,900
and blue let's save that so now let's

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:39,770
add these to the end of the list let's

00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:43,370
add the yellow that the cyan that's at

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:46,309
the purple and let's save that okay so

00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:54,190
now we got our red or green and our blue

00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:58,190
and next yellow yeah

00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:02,410
next one is cyan and the next one is

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,410
purple that matches my hair

00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,880
so like I've showed you here I think the

00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:16,850
trick really is to work incrementally

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:20,480
that will give you a a deeper

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:25,630
understanding of what's going on under

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:28,880
the hood okay let's switch things around

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:33,170
just going to quickly pass through a few

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:45,110
slides I had the demos recorded in case

00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:47,570
things really didn't work so what can

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:51,250
you use to start writing the code well

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,290
the safest bet is to use an editor like

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:57,290
use an editor that that writes out the

00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:59,059
file completely when you save it that

00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,860
does the smart thing so that you don't

00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:03,500
have to worry about waiting to save you

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,510
don't have to you shouldn't just unplug

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:11,120
it like I am here you should amount the

00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:13,309
drive but I like Leah's code and the

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,559
Python extension for this because it's

00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:18,470
already the editor that I use for Python

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:21,020
I switched from Emacs a few months ago I

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,160
just used a plug-in to set up Emacs

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,100
keyboard shortcuts

00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,410
it has great autocomplete has workspaces

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,990
which are nice because the circuit

00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,390
python itself only has two megabytes of

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:36,260
memory so I usually keep the files that

00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm working on on a separate draw and a

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:42,380
separate folder on my computer it has

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,049
that integrated terminal that you saw me

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,429
using and you know frankly I'd be using

00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:52,280
it even if I didn't work for Microsoft

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:57,110
so who picked up their vias code loves

00:32:52,280 --> 00:33:00,200
Python socks yeah okay awesome I'm glad

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:03,590
to see fans in the room you can also

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:07,400
program with mu it's a simple Python

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:10,250
editor for beginner programmers it might

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,049
also be helpful for you if you're also a

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,809
beginner to programming Python on

00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:18,059
hardware now

00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:21,090
it's helpful to see be able to see

00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,009
what's going on by using print you know

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:27,389
the Python interpreter is running on the

00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:30,059
little device here and it's not running

00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:33,269
on your machine right so you need to be

00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:35,609
able to figure out a way of debugging so

00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,739
I updated my program to add labels to

00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:40,469
the colors and it's going to keep track

00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:42,330
of the previous and next colors now so

00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:44,849
you know just keeping things simple

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,399
using a list of tuples building on my

00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:49,440
previous example I'm going to keep

00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,259
looping forever now I'm also going to

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,259
snag the name and the color at color

00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:58,169
position I'm going to fill those pixels

00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:01,159
and then if button a or button B is

00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:04,109
pressed I'm also going to snag the next

00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,659
name in the list and then I'm going to

00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:12,569
print out changing color from what to

00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:16,200
what okay pretty straightforward so in

00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:17,460
order to view your printouts and your

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,079
errors you're going to need a way to

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,839
communicate with the circuit playground

00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,679
Express and we do that via the serial

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:29,039
console the serial console is what

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,629
receives output and receives output from

00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,970
your circuit python board sent over a

00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:35,429
USB and displays it so that you can see

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:38,059
it you won't see any printouts without

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:40,440
connecting to it it's also helpful for

00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,629
troubleshooting errors because your

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,679
board will send trace backs to the

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:50,010
serial console as well the easy way to

00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,069
do this is with the cross-platform view

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:55,440
editor you just click on the button in

00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:57,539
the top of the bar if your insects like

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,069
a Python mode and it'll pop that open

00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:06,779
right there the advanced way to do it is

00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:10,049
with the terminal you can use program

00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:12,180
like screen for this I like using the vs

00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:14,029
code integrated terminal for this and of

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,710
course vs code is also cross-platform

00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:21,000
but there are plenty of other standalone

00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:23,369
apps like a cool term know that the most

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,380
important thing to know about using

00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,380
screen is how to quit it

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:35,740
so to quit screen you press ctrl an a

00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:40,000
followed by K and then you type Y to

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:45,780
confirm don't forget that it's

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,780
frustrating okay so let's try it out

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:58,920
okay we don't need that anymore you get

00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,920
my next demo going here

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:15,680
yeah close that up okay so just like we

00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,680
talked through earlier I have a some

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,840
labels for my colors I'm getting the

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,280
name current name and the color and then

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,110
when the button is pressed I'm getting

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,330
the next name and the color and the

00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:31,570
trick here is changing the color from

00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:38,980
what to what okay so bringing up the

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:44,090
integrated terminal here I want to LS

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:46,270
dab dot TTY and you should see you

00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:51,560
should see a USB modem here that's the

00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:53,210
circuit playground Express if you you

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,310
might see a lot more stuff here if you

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,890
have stuff connected on Bluetooth or etc

00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,750
but it's always going to be a USB modem

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:02,770
the numbers after it they're going to be

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:05,180
different for you than they are for me

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,120
and then you just want to paste that

00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,910
whole thing and type in the screen okay

00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,590
so you won't you won't see any output

00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,620
just yet because we have to make it do

00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,620
something

00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,140
you quickly make this a little bit

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,140
bigger

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:46,640
Oh No if Pope's of the beast Pam um Oh

00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:50,690
what time okay so now if I press the

00:37:46,640 --> 00:38:02,599
button going back to the kind of

00:37:50,690 --> 00:38:05,950
important code here what will I see what

00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:05,950
should I see printed out here

00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:15,530
changing color from red to green yeah

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,510
and then I can do it again and again

00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:20,980
yeah that's pretty cool you can clap

00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,980
you're allowed drill that's a clap

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:30,110
it's pretty fun okay cool

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:33,320
so there it goes that's how we debug our

00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:35,690
circuit playground Express one other

00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,740
super cool thing here kind of a bit of

00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,850
an easter egg

00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:42,920
if you press control-c here we're going

00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:47,180
to get a message and it's gonna say

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:51,260
press any key to enter the ripple and

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:55,870
guess what just hide that there yeah

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:59,150
there we go we have a ripple right here

00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:05,090
the repple is running on this device so

00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:07,520
that's pretty cool and Scott the

00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:09,740
maintainer of circuit Python is also

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,320
here and I'm gonna give you a way to

00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,210
find him later on in this talk by

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,200
plastering a giant picture of his face

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,200
on the screen

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,780
alright let's switch back

00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:32,450
let me go through some of these

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,509
pre-recorded demos okay here we go

00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,640
so the circuit playground Express

00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:42,739
doesn't have batteries included like

00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:45,019
actual batteries but considering that

00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:50,779
how do you go about powering your

00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:52,880
projects well USB is the easiest option

00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:55,670
you probably already have a microUSB

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,680
cable laying around you have a phone

00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,329
charging battery that's one way of

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,109
making your circuit playground Express

00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:04,999
portable you can power it from a

00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:08,239
computer portable phone charger or a

00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:09,680
wall or you can use the battery pack it

00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,440
just has to have a particular type of

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,410
jst connector and you need a minimum of

00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,299
three point 5 volts 3 point 5 volts know

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,519
that one household triple-a battery has

00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:23,029
one and a half volts so you'll need

00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:26,599
three of them and an enclosure to power

00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:28,969
your circuit playground this way you can

00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,420
also power it with lithium polymer or

00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:34,579
light poly batteries just a quick

00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,950
warning here they're only for advanced

00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:38,869
users they are small lightweight and

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,269
they're energy dense they have a lot of

00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,979
energy in a small package but they're

00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:46,489
for advanced users only because they're

00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:49,069
fragile they need a lot of special care

00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:52,700
you don't want to heat them puncture

00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:58,400
them bend them if they short or they're

00:40:52,700 --> 00:41:00,650
damaged they can explode and for that

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,479
reason the circuit playground Express

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,239
does not come with charging circuitry

00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:07,609
for light Polly batteries so if you want

00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:12,019
to use this option for powering your

00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:13,489
devices you're going to want to buy your

00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:16,759
own charger and make sure it's suitable

00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:18,559
for your battery's capacity it should

00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:21,799
come with a special protection circuitry

00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,190
and note that it's not for kids without

00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,190
supervision

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,420
these batteries are difficult to ship

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,920
they're also difficult to dispose of so

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,829
make sure you do your research and buy

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,829
them from a reputable source okay so

00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:39,329
putting it all together there is initial

00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,920
code that comes with the circuit

00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:42,720
playground on your swag bag you can

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,359
investigate it there's also more

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,730
advanced demo code that came with one of

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,800
my circuit playground expresses I didn't

00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,680
write it but here's a link to download

00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,329
it this came from Adafruit and this code

00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,400
covers all of the other necessary

00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:01,200
features and the sensor readings that

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,760
you might want to work with and there's

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,680
even a flag you can use to set the

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,030
circuit playground express into a piano

00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,839
using capacitive touch pads let me show

00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,839
you how to do that

00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,520
let's just move that over

00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:31,160
I think switching the sources may be

00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:33,829
what makes the camera unhappy so I'll go

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,130
ahead and and not do that I'll try to

00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:38,630
minimize that okay moving this to the

00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,819
side I have another one that comes with

00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,529
this pre-loaded code um you'll see it's

00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:46,249
powered by one of these light poly

00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:48,319
batteries I told you about normal

00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:50,779
circuit playground expresses come in

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,640
this black color but because yours was

00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:55,789
sponsored by a to fruit and digi-key

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,359
your special limited edition one is in

00:42:55,789 --> 00:43:04,940
digi-key colors yeah so let's plug that

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:08,059
in and this code says you can turn on a

00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:11,299
flag to have it do this if the switch is

00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:14,150
set to believe the on position make this

00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:16,489
thing a tiny noisy piano by using these

00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,949
are oops I press the reset button that's

00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:22,430
not what I wanted to do okay make these

00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:28,160
capacitive touch input pads play tones

00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:30,489
so let's see guys can I'll hear that

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,489
right

00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:44,140
well so I didn't write this code I came

00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:47,019
from adafruit Shh quiet now let's turn

00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,900
that switch back okay so um the code

00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:53,739
that comes on your circuit playground

00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,809
Express this one right here there is a

00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:58,630
flag that you can set to true to make

00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:00,429
your own noisy piano so that's the very

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:04,679
first thing you can do with your circuit

00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,679
playground Express after the talk please

00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:18,159
and you can start your own chip change

00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:19,900
jam bands okay wrapping things up if you

00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,569
want to get started programming hardware

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,669
with absolutely zero coding Microsoft

00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:28,059
make code is fantastic for this it's a

00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:31,359
code but it's a block-based editor you

00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:34,949
can export as JavaScript there might be

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,949
other things coming in the future

00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:41,559
don't don't clap for this one and there

00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:43,209
are some pretty cool collaborations

00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,849
there like with Cartoon Network one of

00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:51,459
the projects is making a gem from Steven

00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:53,279
universe which I yes and the cool thing

00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:55,749
there is you don't even need a device

00:44:53,279 --> 00:45:00,099
hardware is not required it includes

00:44:55,749 --> 00:45:02,769
this built in emulator so I'm not the

00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:07,119
only one who thinks that hardware is

00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:10,779
cool a study done by the BBC for the

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:14,589
microbe it said that 90% of students

00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:17,949
that use the microbe it showed them that

00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:23,499
it showed them that anyone can code it's

00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:25,329
really important 86% of students said

00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:29,409
the microbe it made computer science

00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:32,439
more interesting this one is a little

00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:33,969
bit close to heart 70% more girls said

00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:37,679
they would choose computing as a school

00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:37,679
subject after using the microbe it

00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:56,470
a study called unlocking the clubhouse

00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:58,900
suggested that traditional computing

00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,970
culture is a boys club and it's

00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,400
unfriendly to women and we need to find

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:08,500
ways to unlock this clubhouse to make it

00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:13,059
accessible in a study on e textiles

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:15,339
called lily pad in the wild Leia

00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:18,279
buchelli and Benjamin Mac o hills

00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:21,220
suggest a different approach they call

00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:23,319
it building new club houses instead of

00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,180
trying to fit people into existing

00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:27,760
engineering cultures it may be more

00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:30,339
constructive to try to spark and support

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,910
new cultures to build new club houses

00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:37,569
and make room for more diverse interests

00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:41,619
and passions because remember diversity

00:46:37,569 --> 00:46:43,990
doesn't stop at gender we want to use

00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:46,779
Python on hardware to encourage everyone

00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,339
to participate that includes people of

00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:52,619
different ethnicities socioeconomic

00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:56,170
statuses identities the neuro-diverse

00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,210
those diverse in age and so many other

00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,500
factors

00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:06,970
let's make Python on Hardware of the

00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:08,740
most diverse community that we can the

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,390
overall hardware community it's really

00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,220
awesome about sharing incredible

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,750
projects with step-by-step instructions

00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,059
there are eight if route guides make

00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,940
code Instructables is a great resource

00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:22,329
on the left as a jack-o-lantern project

00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:25,869
you only need the board batteries and a

00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:31,390
ziploc bag if you're going to opt for a

00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:33,609
real pumpkin and Python on hardware is

00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:40,450
still relatively new it's really just in

00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:43,660
its infancy this is Madison Maxine

00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:46,960
she's the founder of Lumia an e textile

00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:49,740
smart fabric technology company and she

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,440
says you can be a creator and an artist

00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:56,750
not just a consumer and

00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,750
I agree with her here you know start

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:04,250
small start unlocking your own creative

00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:07,760
coding again continue your momentum this

00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,839
is Angela Sheehan let's see if I can get

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,750
that video to play

00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:14,109
she's a maker that I look up to you can

00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:17,450
see she's created these incredible

00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:20,450
infinity mirror LED heels and a lot more

00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:21,710
if you love her project she's actually

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,960
currently looking for her next

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:26,420
opportunity and the maker EdTech space

00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,690
so someone in this room should snap her

00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:34,880
up yes

00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:36,410
and she she follows the same passion

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:42,559
that I do right she makes things that

00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:44,390
fit her aesthetic and that's the nature

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,270
of hardware it's being able to see

00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:50,539
instantaneous results it lets you

00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:53,660
customize your projects that lets helps

00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:55,700
you connect from the very start it helps

00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,710
make technology more accessible to those

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,940
traditionally underrepresented in it

00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:04,369
this picture of girls with their

00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:06,799
light-up masks that they created with

00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:07,970
these huge beaming smiles as one of my

00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:11,900
absolute favorites

00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:15,589
I mean how happy are they how excited

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:19,480
are they to have made this these masks

00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:22,670
right that light up they're super fun a

00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:25,880
textiles so Abul electronics paper

00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:28,069
crafts hardware focus towards education

00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:32,510
they all help introduce technology and

00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:35,559
new and unexpected ways introduce it to

00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:39,430
to these made by girls participants

00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:44,329
thank you to the digital media academy

00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:46,430
for snapping this photo okay so those of

00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,900
you with eagle eyes might have noticed

00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:53,829
that I'm wearing one of my projects

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:53,829
today and let me

00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:00,060
let me show you what it's made out of

00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,950
let's see

00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:21,260
so the projects that I'm wearing is made

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:26,330
with a different board called the this

00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:29,000
is the Gemma m0 it's made with some LED

00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:31,430
rings that look like this kind of

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,830
soldered together these ones are nice

00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:39,620
because you can just snap them out kind

00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:42,940
of see that they pop out they're so cool

00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:46,070
some individually addressable LEDs and

00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:48,470
then one of those like poly battery is

00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:53,030
that I told you about so just kind of

00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:54,320
assembled by starting with the LED rings

00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:57,380
and then the little battery is

00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,660
sandwiched in and the Gemma lives on top

00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,700
and it's all soldered together there's a

00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,120
Fritzing diagram there if you want to

00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,120
see how

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,739
[Music]

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:31,349
so these are based on an original design

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:35,690
by Becky Stern the code is on github but

00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:35,690
because my earrings run Python

00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:56,880
I hope that you've seen now that Python

00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,960
opens up a whole new world of working

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,570
with hardware

00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,300
I feel like this quote by Lawrence

00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:07,040
Terrell really drives at home he says

00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:09,750
our inventions mirror our secret wishes

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:15,420
right we want to build things that

00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:17,060
reflect us so for those of you here in

00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,290
the room today what are your next steps

00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:21,870
you all have a circuit playground

00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:24,240
express in your swag bags remember I'm

00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:25,770
not an expert I'm just a hobbyist and I

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,480
hope I've shown you today that you don't

00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,950
need to be an expert either to get

00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,950
started with it right away

00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:34,800
pick your editor your visual studio code

00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:37,440
your mu etcetera write your own code or

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,300
follow a community guide everyone in

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,540
this room can pick up a basic project

00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:45,660
even if you're not a programmer so I

00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:49,050
implore you to learn make things create

00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,850
teach others share your knowledge it's a

00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:55,140
fantastic cycle that we can all

00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:59,400
participate in and if you're in a

00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:02,640
position to maybe gift yours to somebody

00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:06,360
who's underrepresented in tech and show

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:11,030
them how to get started it's just an

00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,030
idea yeah you can that's alright

00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:20,880
you can give them a platform to unlock

00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:23,959
their interest and lighting up their

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:28,739
life with hardware creativity and

00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:31,019
community so I want to say let's start

00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:34,680
something new I noticed that the Python

00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:40,499
hardware hashtag has never been used so

00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:44,369
let's make it our own well it was it was

00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:47,400
new sort of Rayman head injure caught a

00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:49,859
preview of this talk yesterday and so in

00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:55,069
good humor he's the first one to tweet

00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:55,069
out on this hashtag thanks Raymond

00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:08,910
so use this hashtag share your projects

00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,609
share your gifts to the community share

00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:15,329
who you're teaching and let's own this

00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:17,400
and make it our own if you're excited

00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:20,729
about getting started right away circuit

00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,589
Python is at PyCon you can see some of

00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:24,720
the folks in this photo there's Scott

00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:27,089
there's cat knee a few other lovely

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,460
folks from Adafruit today they're going

00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:31,680
to have an open space in room 22 at 5:00

00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,900
p.m. tomorrow there are going to be

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,829
circa Python Sprint's starting at 9:00

00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:41,220
a.m. and I have an announcement I wanted

00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:43,680
to share I teach Python and as a special

00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,839
thank you to Pi Con attendees I'm

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,479
releasing my 2-day intro and

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:52,470
intermediate Python screencast for free

00:54:48,479 --> 00:55:01,340
for two weeks at this link

00:54:52,470 --> 00:55:01,340
[Applause]

00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,549
that's been a pleasure speaking to you

00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,739
today hopefully I've left you inspired

00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:10,749
you've learned how to program LEDs with

00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:12,759
Python you've learned how to light up

00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:14,589
your life with code and creativity if

00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:16,660
you want to take a closer look at some

00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:20,859
of this hardware come find me

00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:25,779
or any of the Adafruit team that's here

00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:28,119
at Pi : slides are going to be posted at

00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:31,180
this link if the conference Wi-Fi has

00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:35,289
cooperated if not they're going to be on

00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:37,359
