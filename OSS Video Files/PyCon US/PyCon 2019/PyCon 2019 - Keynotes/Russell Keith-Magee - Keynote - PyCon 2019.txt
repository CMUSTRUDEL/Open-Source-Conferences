good morning

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:53,800

volunteers that make this conference

00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,509
possible to the Python Software

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,820
Foundation for taking on the fiscal

00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,380
responsibility of this conference we

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,990

conference as well and of course this

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,500
this conference that would have no

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,270
purpose without you so I want to thank

people a round of applause

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,240
the very first thing I want to talk

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,530
about is that PyCon is committed to

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,380
providing a safe environment and a

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,880
positive experience for everyone and

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,100
that's regardless of any difference that

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,130
we may have in order to ensure this all

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,310
staff attendees speakers sponsors and

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,240
volunteers have at any Python event are

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,870
required to adhere to our code of

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,670
conduct

00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,290
please familiar site with that

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,110
familiarize yourself with the code of

00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,610
conduct at that URL as well as the

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,470
procedures for handling incidents that

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,840
are linked there and you can find these

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,680
documents there or by going to us stop

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,970
icon dot org under about code of conduct

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,530
if at any point during the conference

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,209
you're concerned that someone may have

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,340
vital it violated the Python code of

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,800
conduct you're encouraged to report it

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,510
if you're unsure whether the incident is

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,740
a violation or whether the space where

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,959
it happened is covered by this code of

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,330
conduct we encourage you to still report

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,860
it the organizers are okay with

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,600
receiving reports where no action is

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,360
taken for the sake of creating a safer

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,489
space at any point you can make a report

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,790
by email to Pyke on us report at

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,760
python.org by SMS or telephone to one

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,970
two oh one eight six two eight five

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,070
seven two or during the conference you

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,030
can find incident responder who will be

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:05,360
wearing a brightly colored t-shirt like

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,830
this once again this is the contact

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,390
information on the screen I'd encourage

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,690
you to take a photograph or write it

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:19,130
down or save it in your mobile phone in

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:21,890
some manner got it cool so quick

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,530
orientation once more welcome to PyCon

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,350
that's where you are if this is your

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,180
very first Python I want to apologize as

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,610
Python is grown trying to detail each

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,850
and every event in every part of the

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:38,600
conference that makes these who's

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,739
calling me that and trying to detail

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,500
each and every part of the conference

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,780
has become pretty much untenable however

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,280
if this is your very first PyCon I hope

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,940
that you heard about or attended our

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,360
newcomer orientation yesterday at 4:45

00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,680
where all the sponsor booths are I

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,660
encourage you to stop by our sponsor

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,430
booths and find out more about why what

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,169
they're using Python for why they've

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,450
decided to support PyCon and the Python

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,580
community by being here our sponsors

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,000
make Python possible and we depend on

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,090
them to key

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,110
pythons registration costs under control

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,150
their presence here represents an

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,030
incredible investment into our community

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,320
and this conference and also make the

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,840
operations with the Python Software

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,130
Foundation possible they're here to meet

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,320
with you encourage you to check out

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,840
their projects and products and possibly

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,150
even hire you a reminder the sponsor

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,430
booths will only be out there today and

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,070
tomorrow on Sunday that entire space

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,860
will be reconfigured in addition

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,040
sponsors I want to take a moment to uh

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,850
very poorly show all the names of the

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,700
corporate companies who sent people to

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,560
PyCon on a corporate registration these

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,290
registrations help offset the cost of

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,660
individual and hobbyist registrations

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,150
I'm sorry student and student and

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,590
hobbyist registrations and go to support

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,090
the Python Software Foundation work as

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:06,490
well in the expo hall still that's a big

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,070
room we do a lot with it is startup ro

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,290
there are some tables and today and

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,900
tomorrow there will be people who

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,060
competed and won a spot on startup row

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,770
these are these are new companies we're

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,450
doing something with Python that might

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,450
be new and interesting so check those

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,310
out note that these change so the people

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,800
that are there today will not be there

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,050
tomorrow and the people and then they'll

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,760
be replaced with other companies so you

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,600
want to stop by startup wrote twice if

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:38,290
you get a chance on Sunday that entire

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,960
room gets reconfigured into our posters

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:45,850
and jobs fair so that would be Sunday

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:50,229
after Sunday morning all right

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:53,470
so on screen are our breakout rooms note

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,200
that there are some distance from where

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,540
we are generally over to these other

00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,680
rooms those are the atrium ballrooms and

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,210
they're right there

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,130
so if you made it here you just need to

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,610
go up that escalator or up that

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,169
escalator or come through this concourse

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,380
to find them they are a little bit of a

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:13,150
distance from the the other talk rooms

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,630
so if your plan to see a talk in there

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,280
make some consideration for time we have

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,470
five talk tracks with ninety five

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,090
sessions once again this year and you

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,280
have 19 opportunities to see one of

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,290
these talks

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,060
but don't worry most of the talks be

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,980
recorded and available online after the

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,330
conference as soon as you start a

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,100
conflict between two talks you'd like to

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,840
see go go with your go with your guy if

00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,700
you do attend to talk for time remains

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,180
and the speaker allows for questions and

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,910
decides to ask and ask for those

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,140
questions in the legendary words of Pike

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,330
on chair emeritus Brandon Rhodes

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:56,130
remember to phrase your question in the

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:59,750
form of a question we have a veritable

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:02,970
fleet of rooms available for open spaces

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,740
all day today Saturday and Sunday these

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,530
rooms are allocated for anyone's self

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,870
organized a one-hour meetup style event

00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,160
and they'll be open from 8 a.m. to 11

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,150
p.m.

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,440
they're a great opportunity to connect

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,780
and have a deeper discussion on

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,260
something that or find people who have a

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,270
shared interest or a common goal I want

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,580
to encourage you to consider shaping

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,010
this the the conference by having your

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,780
own open space you can stop by the board

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,340
the next registration to post your own

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,980
open space or peruse what's already

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,320
there and new this year you can go to

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,140
the URL on screen and at that location

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,790
you'll find a photograph of the current

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,770
day's board that you can sort of pinch

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,540
and zoom around and to see what has been

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,340
posted so you don't have to like

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,990
constantly be crowding around the boards

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,330
so these rooms are something that is

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,080
sort of near and dear to my heart these

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,750
rooms which are 25 C in 26 ABC are home

00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,910
to the Python hatchery program Python is

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,590
a conference has grown and evolved over

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,250
the years through the direction of

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:07,650
volunteers the board and staff last year

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,900
we launched the hatchery program and its

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,590
intended offer anyone the opportunity to

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,730
see their idea come to fruition at PyCon

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,840
whether the intent is at a permanent

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,070
fixture of the conference or it's

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,220
something that's just ephemeral and

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,260
topical or important for any given year

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,990
the hatchery program offers space and

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,300
resources to at PyCon for that idea

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,280
we're excited to have the inaugural

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,110
hatchery hatchery program returning this

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,650
year and three new concepts joining us

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,650
for 2019

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,160
all day today and today only you can

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:43,010
attend a Las park la spike on Charla's

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,680
it's a full day of talks given in

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,450
Spanish that'll be in room 25 see the

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,120
charla schedule is matched to the

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,890
primary talk schedule so you're welcomed

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,240
and encouraged to jump in for just a

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,950
single talk or stay all day new this

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,630
year is the art of Python it's a

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,430
miniature arts festival it's going to

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,740
focus on narrative performance and

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,339
visual art you can find that event this

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,260
evening in rooms in room 26 ABC tonight

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:14,510
from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. so if you're up

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,100
first show you can see that there the

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,020
Python hatchery maintainer summit is

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,220
also new this year and it's seeking to

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,440
build a community of practice for

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,300
projects and maintainer x' project

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,710
maintainer x' and key contributors with

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,960
the goal of helping the Python community

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,730
sustain and grow healthy projects and

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,440
communities this will be a mixture of

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,860
lightning talks and discussions and

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:38,300
it'll be going on from 1050 mAh row from

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,130
10:50 until 2 p.m. in room 25 see also

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,770
new this year are the mentored sprints

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:46,490
they'll run from 2:30 to 6:30 p.m.

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,500
tomorrow in room 25 C and this is a

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,390
newcomers introduction to contributing

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,430
to an open-source project and it's done

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,589
under the mentorship of somebody who has

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,720
more experience and is and has worked on

00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,300
the project in the past these focus on

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,950
providing a less experienced developers

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,870
a supportive environment in which they

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,760
can learn collaborate and expand their

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,970
network and celebrate their victories at

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,880
the end of it so these are the Python

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,610
hatchery programs for this year and if

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,589
you have an idea the patrie program was

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,240
very likely to continue so keep an eye

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,430
out for the CFP which will be launching

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,170
sometime between now and next PyCon I

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,940
really ran out of arrows

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,730
alright I bought too many arrows so I

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,910
had to use them all on this slide so

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,709
PyCon has consumed nearly entirety of

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,810
this Convention Center for the next few

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,370
days and during that time all of the

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,100
public spaces will be scattered with

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,320
Python Easton's it's not an official

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,240
event but this one this is a happening

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
that I never really get the chance to

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,080
miss out on at Pyke

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,580
there are no rules that say you have to

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,220
attend any given event there are no

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,110
rules that say you have to attend every

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,970
till all of your time with a structured

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,190
event so consider spending some time

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,560
joining a table or a group and meet

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,460
someone new open a laptop and explore a

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,230
problem together

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,690
spend some time catching up with someone

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:09,800
you've never met in person before or an

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,060
old friend one suggestion to improve the

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,860
experience in the hallway track and

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,020
throughout PyCon generally though comes

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,050
from PSF and board member eric culture

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,340
and this is the pac-man rule when

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,530
standing in a group of people always

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,380
leave room for one person to join your

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,150
group this suggestion can help create a

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,130
physically welcoming space for someone

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,540
to join your group and makes easy for

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,280
attendees to identify groups that they

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,210
can join so helps meet new people

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,460
throughout the space we have three

00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:41,030
gender-neutral bathrooms one is near

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,940
rooms 17 and 18 one is route near rooms

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,700
25 a B and C and one is inside the expo

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,910
hall so when you're entering from

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:52,070
registration it's on your left there

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,800
also to mother's rooms in the conference

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,760
center these will be room 17 and 18 and

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,580
instructions for access to the room are

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,750
posted outside so if you need help or if

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,540
you need getting it needed in there

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,070
check there and get the instructions if

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,190
you find that you need to take a break

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,010
focus on some work or just breathe we

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,170
have a quiet room in room 24 this is

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,700
this room has a specific purpose so

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,090
please be respectful of the word quiet

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,010
while you're in the space and stepping

00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,680
outside it's always beautiful in

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,980
Cleveland there's never rain or pods

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,720
[Applause]

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,410
we can see our place in the civic center

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,260
of downtown Cleveland around the venue

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,959
there is the PI ladies auction which is

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,730
Saturday May 4th at 6:30 p.m. that's in

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,649
the Hope Ballroom in the connecting

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,820
Hilton downtown Cleveland so you don't

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,420
even have to go outside if you don't

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,760
want to but take a walk last year

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,790
$30,000 is raised to benefit the pi

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,680
ladies for a $5 cover charge it's a hard

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,050
bargain to beat it's probably one of the

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,180
most fun evenings we got going on here

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:02,740
even if you don't come to bid and win

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,029
for an excellent cause just around the

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,250
corner from here so if you go down

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,649
lakeside make a left on 9th and then

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,850
down to the pier you'll find the Rock

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,339
and Roll Hall of Fame in the Great Lakes

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,070
Science Center these are home to the

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,839
pike on dinners 1 this evening at 6:30

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,750
p.m. and one after the close of the

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,959
conference at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday I

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,180
and these evening events are both

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,500
ticketed events so when you rep checked

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,930
in at registration you should have had

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,810
little tickets you'll need to bring

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,220
those tickets to these events and since

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,709
Foods already been pre allocated for

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,560
them if you did get a ticket and you

00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:41,170
don't plan to attend convey your ticket

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,029
to someone else however you see fit this

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:49,329
helps reduce food waste food waste and

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:52,420
keeps the events fun and lively that's a

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:55,000
lot and that's even skipping what we

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,529
what we've already done so if you'd

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,290
prefer to have this information with you

00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:02,589
there is a printed program it looks like

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,089
this and there is Pike USB icon org

00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:07,089
which can be a little bit fiddly to

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,709
navigate and we have a guidebook again

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,140
this year so this is a specific app that

00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,670
has all the schedule information and

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,020
room numbers and such in it and you can

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,459
find that at PyCon dot u.s. slash

00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:22,740
guidebook and yeah I think you're

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:25,209
orienting so time for some housekeeping

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,649
first off the Python Software Foundation

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,880
which does take the fiscal

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,920
responsibility this conference is

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,110
currently running a fundraiser we

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,089
couldn't do this without them so if

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,650
you're able consider going to this URL

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,300
on screen and it will take you to a page

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,990
that includes all the information about

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,800
that fundraiser

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,630
and you can consider contributing if you

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,890
registered for the PyCon fun run and

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:51,010
walk that begins at that kicks off

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,900
Sunday at 7:00 busing begins at 6:00 but

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,720
probably show up around 6:30 so you're

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,560
not just left waiting but if you're

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,320
punctual 6 o'clock it is tomorrow

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:08,290
morning there's a different run it's not

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:10,150
ours you can run along I guess but note

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,670
that if you're coming to the convention

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,220
center particularly by car this will

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,440
cause some congestion as you see we are

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,959
sort of right in the middle of the route

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,670
and so from about 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,270
tomorrow morning tend a little bit of

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,130
extra time to get here the swag bags are

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,570
available for pickup so make sure you go

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:34,840
grab those and inside you will find

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,550
little gadget so thanks to digi-key and

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,950
Adafruit all attendees will receive a

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:43,750
circuit playground Express which runs

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:45,340
Python so 2 notes on this one if you're

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,770
going to be traveling through something

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,330
that involves security checkpoint go

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,720
ahead and take this out of your bag and

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,600
tell the screen or what it is it'll save

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,840
you and them a lot of hassle and

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,990
questioning and considering just just a

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,390
tip and the second one is considered

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,300
bringing this with you on Sunday to our

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,060
closing keynote by the end of it you

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,040
might feel inspired to run out

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,380
immediately and start programming on it

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,730
or you might even code along with some

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:22,980
of the examples so also it needs picking

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,980
up are your t-shirts they look like this

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,090
but I want to take a moment to warn you

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,790
that due to the cut and weight which is

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,740
the same as last year our stott our

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,730
choice in color doesn't quite have as

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,550
much pigment so in full transparency

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,680
these shirts are quite sheer so make

00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,630
sure that you try your shirt on and are

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,990
comfortable wearing it before you wear

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,990
it in public

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,120
if you if you have concerns about your

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,250
t-shirt after picking it up let us know

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:58,490
and lastly I think almost there are some

00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,230
schedule changes us stop I condone org

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,790
the mobile guidebook app I mentioned

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,870
earlier and the signage have all been

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:07,160
updated your printed program has not so

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,510
please take a moment to double check the

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,850
boards in front of the expo hall for

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,070
substitutions but the long short of it

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,780
is that there has been a substitution in

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,700
Grand Ballroom be on Saturday the

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,800
elephant and the serpent using Mastodon

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,690
with Python by Philip James replaces

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,170
code review skills for Python Easton's

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,390
by Nina and shipping your first Python

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:29,330
package and automating future publishing

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,280
by Chris Wilcox substitutes code coated

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,770
readers using Python uncover surprising

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,910
patterns books you love on 3:15 and

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,500
grand ballroom D that's right

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,720
we have a professional photographer on

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,640
site this year if you are uncomfortable

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,190
being photographed in a candid fashion

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,730
you can go pick up a badge holder that

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,260
looks like this and at registration swap

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,690
your badge into it put your lanyard on

00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,660
it and the photographer will avoid

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,970
photographing you but more importantly

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,860
in post we'll make sure not to use any

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,420
photographs of anybody wearing a badge

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,820
that has this red banner at the bottom

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,940
so one last thing which is about social

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:17,540
media a thing near and dear to my heart

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:18,290
I'm gonna take a selfie with you that's

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,040
perfect

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,420
alright and if you want to tweet at the

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,500
conference so this is to get the

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,660
attention of the staff or the organizers

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,280
tweet at PyCon if you want to post about

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,200
the conference so we can look back and

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,470
remember everything that occurred here

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,960
tweet with the hashtag Pike on 2019 with

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,600
all that I am actually hey how's it

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,490
going hey hey I'm very excited to

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,160
introduce our first keynote speaker dr.

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,050
dr. Russel Keith McGee a longtime

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,720
community member founder of the Python

00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,580
or the beware project which brings

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,340
Python to mobile and places maybe it

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,720
shouldn't go

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,910
and a longtime contributor to Django

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,099
Russell take it away

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,099
[Applause]

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,559
thank you very much Ernest hello

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,320
Cleveland

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,090
my name is Russell Keith McGee it is my

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,580
very distinct honor to be here today I

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,860
have been an active and visible

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,410
participant in the Python community for

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,929
over thirteen years now and as a result

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,789
I have spoken at a lot of Pi cons and

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,600
Django Khan's but for those who haven't

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:35,720
met me before

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,630
hi you may have noticed I'm not a local

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,220
I was born and I lived to this day on

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,870
that little red dot down the bottom

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,900
corner of the map Perth Western

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,429
Australia Perth is not usually one of

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,860
the cities people think of when they

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,049
think of Australia it's kind of like

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,289
Cleveland in that regard it's a fine

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:56,440
city but not usually the one that jumps

00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,940
to mind when people think of the US

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,770
Perth has a fascinating history though

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,330
and it says a bit it has had a bigger

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,429
impact on the world than many people

00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,950
realize some of those stories are

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:08,480
convenient metaphors so today I would

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,130
like to teach you all about Perth and

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,070
maybe we can all learn some valuable

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,710
lessons about life along the way first

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,010
off some terminology we are in Ohio

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,450
someone from Ohio is called a Buckeye

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,580
someone from Western Australia is called

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:29,390
and I swear I'm not making this up

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:31,070
a sandgroper we are so named after this

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,720
delightful fellow and if you don't like

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,870
insects be warned you're about to see a

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,299
large one this guy salindra coccus Lynde

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,669
Australia cocky I it is a pygmy mole

00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,049
cricket it's about two inches long lives

00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:47,929
in the sand dunes at the beach and

00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:50,780
they're not venomous sandgroper the

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:53,360
people not the insects have a tradition

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,610
about how you start big public events

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,559
like a plaque on Australia like the US

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:00,289
and Canada and many other colonized

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,850
nations have a messy history where

00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:04,280
they're in their indigenous popular

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,860
peoples an in recognition of that fact

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,900
starting in Perth in the 1970s

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,940
Australian public gatherings have

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,830
increasingly started with a recognition

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,840
that the land whether where the

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,880
gathering is happening wasn't always

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,929
white man's land

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,090
it's called acknowledgement of country

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,650
and in that spirit I would like to

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,740
acknowledge that I come from Wagner

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,600
Abuja

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,640
and I would like to recognize the eerie

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,169
Honan and have dinosaur knee peoples the

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,179
traditional owners of the land where we

00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:31,919
are meeting today to recognize their

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,899
continuing connection to their lands

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,669
their waters and their culture and to

00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:38,779
pay my respects to their elders past

00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:38,779
present and future

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,560
also as a Content warning I will be

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,870
discussing issues of depression and

00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,730
self-harm later in this talk if that is

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,410
something that will impact on you please

00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,970
do whatever you need to do for self-care

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:02,360
I will give another warning before I get

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,890
to that segment of the talk so to the

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,040
subject at hand we have established that

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,270
yes I do come from a land down under but

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,550
Who am I

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,500
okay well in my day job I do data

00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,870
engineering force avada savato is a

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,880
market research company they do I use

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,980
Python and data science to help brands

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
to understand their customers savato

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,190
gives me the flexibility to flit about

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,560
the planet and meet all you lovely

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,420
people but as lovely as it is to have

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,670
the support of a wonderful company like

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:32,420
savato that's not really why I'm here

00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:34,670
today I became involved in and I'm known

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,010
to the Python community through my work

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:40,910
on Django I joined the Django core team

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:43,430
way back in 2006 and because I lived in

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:47,660
Perth I didn't meet another member of

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:50,030
the Django core team until 2008 Django

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,980
is a big part of the Python ecosystem

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,600
but it's not the only part

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,340
Django isn't the only Python web

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,640
framework and web programming isn't the

00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,930
only thing that people do with Tyson I

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,330
in my current day job at Safari

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,550
I don't use Django at all but I do make

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,260
extensive use of numpy and Jupiter and

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,050
pandas and the ecosystem of tools around

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,390
those libraries and there are many other

00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,160
uses of Python you can use Python on

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,870
embedded devices there are libraries for

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,270
performing astronomical calculations

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,530
doing biotech and gene sequencing it's

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,390
used as a scripting language for

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,100
operating system automation as a control

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,950
language for DevOps as a teaching

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,770
language none of this happened

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,890
overnight Python is a language is 28

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,840
years old it took maybe ten years for

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,150
Python to gain any sort of significant

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,830
traction in our industry at another ten

00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:41,800
before it gained really widespread

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:44,150
support and as a result we get this a

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,950
gathering of three and a half thousand

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,250
people who have organized to travel from

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,190
all over the planet even Perth to

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,690
converge in of all places Cleveland to

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,990
talk about a programming language for a

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,670
couple of days it's worth stopping for a

00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,750
moment to reflect on the magnitude of

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,910
what Guido

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,590
set in motion 28 years ago and what we

00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,330
collectively as a community have done

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,840
with that since it should be celebrated

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,280
because it's not it's no small feat and

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,930
because this is the big tent of the

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,490
Python community we have a real

00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,530
opportunity here to look to the future

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,700
as well this weekend and into the

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,370
Sprint's next week we have the

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,680
opportunity to dream big ideas to work

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,240
out what problems we need to solve where

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,580
we're going to collectively focus our

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,130
efforts over the coming weeks months and

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,690
years and so to kick start that

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,020
conversation I would like to pose a

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:36,710
question to everyone in this room where

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,200
do you see Python in ten years the one

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,430
thing I am certain of is that everyone

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,990
in this room will have a different

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,300
answer to that question this is just

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,660
inevitable when a language is used by so

00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,560
many people for so many different things

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,110
but if you're here in this room today

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,320
it's probably fair to assume that you

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:56,210
like Python to some degree and in 10

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,280
years you'd probably like to see Python

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,040
be as least a vibrant community as it is

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,410
today I'm sure nobody here wants to have

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,060
to rewrite all the libraries on pi PI or

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,650
rebuild all the communities and user

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,260
groups in the Python ecosystem or

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,210
re-establish all our ecosystem norms in

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,890
a new community just because Python is

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,410
no longer a viable language for new

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,720
projects so this question where do you

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,660
see Python in 10 years is really about

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,150
asking what do we need to do today to

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:27,170
ensure that Python remains a vibrant

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:29,570
relevant healthy community so time for

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,910
some more sandgroper facts the state

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,130
bird of Western Australia is the Black

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,690
Swan it appears on the West Australian

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,190
flag and on the crest of the city of

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,020
Perth the run of the river running

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,590
through the middle of Perth is called

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,590
the Swan River but a Black Swan is also

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:48,610
a metaphor prior to the 1600s it was

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,990
well known that all swans are white

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:54,620
swans of other colors were known to not

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,270
exist and then in 1697 Dutch explorer

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,150
Villeneuve lambing visited Western

00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:02,210
Australia accidentally and discovered

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:04,490
that swans could also be black this

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:08,840
radically changed the world's idea of

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:11,060
what a swan was in 2001 essayist and

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,320
statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb used

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,580
this as a broader metaphor

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,379
Taleb just refined a

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,600
Swan event as an event that is a

00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:19,759
surprise to the observer that has a

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,279
major effect on the world but in

00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,889
hindsight can be easily explained in

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,989
hindsight it's obvious that swans could

00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:28,879
be black but until someone visited

00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,499
Western Australia and saw one it never

00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:33,350
occurred to anyone to challenge the

00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:35,389
Assumption Black Swan events don't have

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,489
to be immediate either the impact can be

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:41,179
felt over time the rise of the personal

00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:43,789
computer was a Black Swan event in 1947

00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:45,470
the CEO of IBM Thomas Watson famously

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,919
said that there was a world market for

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,350
maybe five computers today almost

00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:55,970
everyone in this room is carrying five

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:59,509
computers in retrospect Watson's

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,249
comments are just quaintly naive but at

00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:02,899
the time they weren't controversial they

00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:04,879
were just the common understanding of

00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:07,489
the world and the change was an

00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:10,820
immediate but in retrospect it was

00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:12,379
inevitable in my opinion when we're

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,850
thinking about what the future holds for

00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:17,269
Python we need to be thinking about

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,429
pythons black swans Python is a popular

00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,399
language right now we'd like it to stay

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:24,739
popular what could happen to affect that

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,029
popularity what change could happen in

00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:27,590
the industry in Hardware in the

00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,359
community that could alter the

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,239
popularity of Python that would cause

00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,470
Python to become that annoying legacy

00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,970
language that we have to know but would

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,600
really rather replace at the earliest

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:41,059
opportunity Black Swan events are truly

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,309
only hot obvious in hindsight but the

00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:45,470
best way to avoid them is to actively

00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:47,539
challenge your assumptions and the

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,340
question what would happen if those

00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:51,529
assumptions turn out to be incorrect and

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,899
I think there's a couple we may have

00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:56,869
cause to be concerned about first off

00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:59,149
where do you run Python for pretty much

00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:01,340
the entire existence of Python a

00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:03,139
computer was a large box that sat on

00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,730
your desk maybe in a rack in a server

00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:06,109
room over time that box has gotten

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,700
smaller we start throwing any way into

00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,649
our backpack but you're using the same

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,529
operating system Windows or a UNIX

00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:14,539
derivative over the last 10 years we

00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,730
have seen the emergence of a whole new

00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:20,629
class of computing devices much smaller

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:24,169
usually portable phones tablets watches

00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:27,380
set-top boxes these devices are becoming

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:30,110
ubiquitous they are replacing laptops

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,300
as primary computing devices my son

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,040
started high school last year he doesn't

00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,470
have a laptop for school

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,740
his entire educational experience is

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:43,310
delivered through a tablet device if you

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:46,090
go to python.org tablets phones set-top

00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:49,040
boxes watches don't even rate a mention

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,570
now to me that seems like a fairly big

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,240
oversight of the way the everyday

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:55,400
experience of computing has changed over

00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,690
the last 10 years phones and tablets are

00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,030
achieving market penetration that

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,210
desktops and laptops have never seen and

00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:04,520
yet as a community we don't have a story

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,900
for how you can use Python on these

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,850
devices so what happens when Python what

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,480
happens to Python when laptops don't

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,670
exist

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,770
well there are niche devices if I'm a

00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,870
novice programmer and there's no

00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,430
installer for Python on my tablet and I

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:22,510
can't use Python to write an app for my

00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:25,400
tablet why am I going to learn Python

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,510
now okay not all Python runs on laptops

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,610
though some of it runs on the server

00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,860
fine and you can use Python to write a

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,630
fine web application ten years ago when

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,890
Django was the cool new thing you

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,050
installed Python on the server

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,940
you used it to render HTML and CSS to

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,830
your browser and if you were really hip

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,870
you'd use it to read to sprinkling some

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,550
Ajax as well and now add autocomplete to

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,170
your search box but you made sure if the

00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,460
user didn't have JavaScript enabled the

00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,380
page would gracefully degrade and it

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,750
would still work these days

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,860
good luck finding a web page that works

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,800
without JavaScript enabled

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,290
as with mobile devices the last 10 years

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,660
has seen a dramatic shift in where code

00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,750
is being executed increasingly code is

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,790
being run in the browser javascript has

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,830
evolved from an optional client-side

00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,810
add-on to a language that is

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,940
implementing key business logic in the

00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:14,720
browser to a language that is replacing

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,920
Python on the server now again if I'm a

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,140
novice programmer and I'm faced with

00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,730
JavaScript a language I can use to get a

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,470
native experience in the browser and I

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,090
can transition that onto the server and

00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,750
on the other hand there's Python a

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:29,690
language that only works on the server

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,160
why am I going to learn Python okay so

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,510
let's say despite those two problems

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,980
I've still committed to learning Python

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,340
and I reach the point where I need to

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,900
install a package I have been a user of

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,640
Python for twenty years and in that

00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,149
entire time I don't think there's been a

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,469
period

00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:45,859
where I would have described hyphens

00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:47,960
Packaging story as stable and that's

00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:49,669
because information lists forever on the

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,109
Internet old advice continues to linger

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:52,429
long after it's considered the right

00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:54,049
answer and then well-meaning but

00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,190
misinformed people spread to spread

00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,950
outdated advice on Stack Overflow

00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,599
perpetuating the problem the situation

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,440
is bad enough that it's a punch line for

00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:05,599
comics xkcd 1987 randall munroe

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,369
Lampoon's python in pythons environment

00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,059
experience has so degraded that it made

00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:12,619
his laptop a toxic waste site

00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:14,629
Brett cannon did a really good write-up

00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:16,159
about this comic trying to diagnose what

00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,989
has happened to Brandon's computer it's

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,239
a really enlightening autopsy and well

00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:21,889
worth the read but one thing that Brett

00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:23,450
points out and it's the part that's most

00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:26,149
concerning for me from the perspective

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:30,109
of looking for black swans is this why

00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:32,119
can that joke be made at all good jokes

00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:33,589
always contain an element of truth and

00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,929
the way you respond to that truth

00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:39,440
matters this joke is part of a narrative

00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:42,169
about what python is if that picture

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,889
isn't positive long term that's an

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:47,539
existential threat if I'm a new user why

00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:49,399
would I want to learn Python if

00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,989
everything I read about it ends up with

00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:54,469
a joke about my computer becoming a

00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:55,729
toxic waste site and I haven't even got

00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:57,349
to the question of how I distribute my

00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,909
application to someone else whether you

00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:00,099
are distributing a django application or

00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,539
distributing a user space application

00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:04,849
Python hasn't ever had a consistent

00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,710
story for how I give my code to someone

00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:08,779
else especially if that someone else

00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:11,419
isn't a developer and just wants to use

00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:13,879
my application contrast that with for

00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:16,549
example PHP whose distribution story is

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,470
use FTP to upload all the files or go

00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:20,960
story which is here have this executable

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,970
now I'm not saying that PHP or go

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,289
solutions of panaceas they're not and

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,389
I'm not saying that Python the story

00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:29,329
could ever be as simple as those but we

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,279
haven't got a story at all and we're

00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:33,829
competing against languages that do and

00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:35,659
again why would I want to learn Python

00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:38,000
if I can't get a clear answer for that

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,539
basic question of how I give my code to

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,889
my non program of friends now that's for

00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,450
possible black swans I've just

00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:46,010
identified maybe the problem will be

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,480
something else I know there are people

00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,730
in this room will assert that Python

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,980
capi is a potential problem or the Gil

00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,940
or the lack of a good front end story or

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,679
focusing on UNIX and Mac to explore

00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,060
of Windows maybe the problem won't be

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,160
technical at all maybe it will be

00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,930
cultural some aspect of pythons

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,450
community or development process that

00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,130
drives the way some segments of users or

00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,319
potential contributors because of

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,750
perceived hostility or conflict or

00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,310
diverging interests maybe it won't be

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,950
any of those things at all my point is

00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:16,530
we can't predict the future but we can

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,910
challenge our assumptions we can look

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,890
critically at ourselves as a community

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,140
we can examine trends in our industry in

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,030
our society and make plans based on

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,470
those assessments not just reacting to

00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,660
problems when they're already wildfires

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,819
but proactively addressing problems

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,119
before they become critical threats to

00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:35,250
our ecosystem I also want to be very

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,349
very clear here this is not an

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,599
accusation I am not blaming someone of

00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,859
not doing their job the Python core team

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,569
and the rest of people who work on

00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,369
Python packages are doing the absolute

00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:46,380
best they can with the resources they

00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,569
have and they are very limited resources

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,910
what I'm talking about here is trying to

00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,470
avoid black swans to start a

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,450
conversation about longer-term

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,359
priorities about how we marshal the

00:35:54,450 --> 00:36:00,300
resources that we as a community have at

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,280
our disposal for whatever it's worth

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,720
these existential problems are one of

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,280
the reasons that I changed the focus of

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,260
my open source contributions a few years

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,000
ago as I said earlier I developed my

00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,310
reputation working on Django but these

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,500
days I spend most of my volunteer time

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,849
working on the bewhere project for those

00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,950
who haven't come across it before beware

00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:18,630
is a collection of open-source tools and

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,210
libraries for creating native user

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,609
interfaces in python for desktop but

00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,050
also for iOS for Android a single page

00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:27,329
web apps and other new hardware

00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,280
platforms a key part of this work is

00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:31,710
getting Python to run on phones and

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,109
tablets at all working out how to run

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,030
Python code on Android on iOS in the

00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,710
browser bridging to native api's and

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,819
those platforms wrapping those api's in

00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,829
a cross-platform layout

00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:42,480
another big part is developing a

00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,670
distribution story working out how to

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,349
integrate with native platform tools to

00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,599
get an application written in Python

00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,280
wrapped as an app with an installer or

00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,150
uploaded to the App Store a Play Store

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,819
now

00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,819
beware is a work in progress its current

00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:58,950
status compelling proof of concept it's

00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:00,480
not a version one pretty product ready

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,430
to start using to develop your

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,270
mission-critical applications but I have

00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,890
been able to demonstrate that

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,200
cross-platform native applications

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,580
written in Python is possible

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,930
I'm also not the only person working on

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,190
this problem the kibbeh project for

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,440
example has similar goals but with

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,910
differences in their underlying approach

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,040
far as beware is concerned about 18

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,350
months ago I did a live demo at PyCon

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,360
Australia 2017 where I wrote a

00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:24,250
Fahrenheit to Celsius application about

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,650
50 lines of Python code and then

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:29,980
deployed it on mac o s-- as a Mac OS app

00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:32,680
on Linux as a Linux app windows as a

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,530
Windows app on iOS as an iOS app on

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,510
Android as an Android app and as a

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,010
single page web application and all that

00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,360
I managed to do in the space of 17

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:45,270
minutes

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:48,510
[Applause]

00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:51,270
and when I say deployed I don't mean I

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:54,240
ran the code I mean on Mac what you had

00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,980
was a standalone app file on Windows it

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,050
was an MSI installer on iOS and Android

00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,250
it was a packaged app was running on the

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,840
device simulator but who could have

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,670
easily been uploaded to an App Store and

00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,830
it was running in the browser completely

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,690
client-side including doing the

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:11,400
Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion in

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:14,790
Python in the browser now as you might

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,200
imagine this is a big project I have

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,490
been working on Beware for years and

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,200
there are days where I really do feel

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,720
like Sisyphus pushing a boulder up the

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,280
hill unfortunately there has not been a

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,480
lot of visible progress since I did that

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,950
demo there have even been some

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,590
regressions our Android and web support

00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:31,020
are currently broken for reasons and

00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,790
that's because it's not my day job I am

00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,280
tinkering on this in what I amusingly

00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:39,119
referred to as my spare time and as a

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,560
result progress is slow but despite all

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,350
this I am actually optimistic about

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,369
pythons future and to explain why I need

00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,000
to tell you about another piece of

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:50,270
sandgroper history about a yacht race I

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,980
need to tell you about the America's Cup

00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:54,930
the America's Cup is the world's oldest

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,060
international sporting trophy the

00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,530
America's Cup race is held about every

00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,300
four years those of you from San

00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,040
Francisco may remember the 2013

00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,310
America's Cup raced in San Francisco Bay

00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,830
but from the first race in 1851 to 1980

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:11,520
the winner was the New York Yacht Club

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,170
in 1993 New York lost to the Royal Perth

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,400
Yacht Club and it's yacht Australia to

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:19,859
breaking a 132 year winning streak it is

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,280
difficult for me to understand how big a

00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:25,920
deal this was in Australia and in Perth

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,260
specifically this was the events that

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,170
put Perth on the world stage for pretty

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,060
much the first time many of you today

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,220
probably even know about the 1983

00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,600
America's Cup without knowing why some

00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,970
of you may have heard me drop the line

00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,130
that I come from a land down under that

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,230
is a line from a song by Australian rock

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,090
band men at work the song was the

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,790
unofficial theme song of Australia too

00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,980
and it was popular in the US primarily

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:52,560
because of the 1983 America's Cup

00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,540
challenge the movie Crocodile Dundee was

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,970
conceived of unable to get financed and

00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,680
released in part because of the exposure

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,410
that Australia received from

00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,810
America's Cup just to be clear though

00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:08,520
Outback Steakhouse we had nothing to do

00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:10,500
with that that's on your butt

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,120
other than the Perth connection why does

00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,340
the America's Cup and Australia to

00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,680
matter well first off let's talk about

00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:19,080
New York's winning streak the yacht's in

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,850
the 1993 race I want to call 12 meter

00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,140
yachts and despite the name it's

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,340
actually got nothing to do with the

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,350
length of the boat it describes a

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,360
complex set of rules for the design of

00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,610
yachts involving sail area waterline

00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,310
length and more however the America's

00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:35,370
Cup hasn't always been raced on twelve

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,810
many yachts prior to 1956 a range of

00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,310
different yacht classes were reused

00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,800
according to the deed for the Trophy the

00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,540
defending club must accept regular

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,880
challenges but they're allowed to set

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,560
the rules for those challenges and so

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,510
for many years the New York Yacht Club

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,430
would impose rules like the Challenger

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,740
must come from an ocean yacht club and

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:55,860
must sail to the competition site on its

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:57,840
own hull that is a challenger from

00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,240
England would have to cross the Atlantic

00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,740
in their yacht whereas the defender

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,910
would just pop out from Newport Harbor

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:08,010
and surprisingly under those conditions

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:11,940
New York's yachts were consistently

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:13,260
lighter and faster so less than one from

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,730
the America's Cup it's not enough to

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,360
just follow the rules you have to ensure

00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,790
the competition is fair the New York

00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,800
Yacht Club wasn't breaking any rules

00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,810
they didn't write the deed for the

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,810
trophy they were just playing the hand

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:30,200
they were given but nobody in their

00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:33,960
right mind would call the competition

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,850
fair in a situation like that you have a

00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,320
choice you can either keep winning the

00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,660
competition that's been stacked in your

00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,790
favor or you can change what is in your

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,400
control and make it a fair competition

00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,590
but you don't get to claim you are the

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,480
best in the world winning on merit

00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:52,230
unless you have leveled the playing

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,450
field first could this be a metaphor for

00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,220
the IT industry you know I think it

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,050
might be I'm just gonna put that over

00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,640
there

00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,290
but to their credit the New York Yacht

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,390
Club adopted there were 12 me to rule in

00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,700
1958 and so since then the competition

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,540
had been fair so why hadn't anyone else

00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,300
won well

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,940
a Black Swan happened sailing is a

00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,530
highly competitive activity and the New

00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,090
York Yacht Club always filled at a

00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:18,190
strong defense with well-designed yachts

00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,020
highly capable crews and when you add in

00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,520
home harbor advantage knowing the this

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,440
local seas and prevailing winds of

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,390
Newport Harbor it's you know easier to

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,160
continue winning and the design of 12

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,560
meter yachts was essentially finessing a

00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,849
well-established design ok sure there

00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,410
are variations between boats but they

00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:36,070
were relatively well understood tweaks

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:39,010
of a basic design Australia too was a

00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,420
black swan when Australia 2 arrived in

00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,490
the United States the lower half of the

00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,920
boat was shrouded in secrecy this

00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,619
invited all sorts of wild theories

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,380
especially when it started winning races

00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:52,270
on two separate occasions the Australian

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,280
team caught scuba divers trying to take

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,840
a peek there were all sorts of

00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,320
accusations that whatever was under that

00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,490
shroud must be illegal but the Qing team

00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,810
kept the secret right up into the

00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,760
victory celebration when the team owner

00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,140
stood on the dock called for the boat to

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,680
be raised into the air for all to see

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,869
revealing the winged keel on most boats

00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,160
the keel is a simple flat surface used

00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:14,950
to lower the center of mass of the hull

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,210
counterbalancing sail forces been lexan

00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,500
the designer of Australia to thought

00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,050
about it differently he reasoned that

00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,240
the keel is a hydrodynamic surface so

00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:23,440
let's treat it like one and he added a

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,810
pair of winglets to the bottom of the

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,640
keel those winglets perform a single not

00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,800
similar role to the winglets on our jet

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,570
airliners wing winglets on a plane cause

00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,300
the wing to generate more lift and less

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:36,190
drag and the same is true on a kill but

00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,690
winglets make the keel more effective at

00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,430
keeping the boat upright which means the

00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,859
sail is more effective and therefore the

00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,780
boat is faster the blue paint was

00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:45,280
camouflage so if you did get a photo of

00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,450
the boat in the water you'd see the

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,250
outline of a traditional keel shape

00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:54,310
fast-forward to 1987 and and the

00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,900
Australia's defense every yacht had

00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,609
something secret they were fiberglass

00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,170
hulls they were all sorts of keel shapes

00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:00,400
there were dynamic keels and the

00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,650
innovation has continued to this day

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,810
carbon-fiber hull solid sales and more

00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:06,010
the America's Cup isn't sailed on

00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,500
12-meter yachts anymore

00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,270
the next America's Cup in 2021 will be

00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,200
sailed on what are called a sea 75

00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,829
yachts

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,930
which are quite literally flying boats

00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:18,430
they are so light they generate so much

00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:20,980
thrust from their sails if they are able

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,089
to use their keel as a hydrofoil and

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,500
lift out of the water

00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:28,660
these boats travel at amazing speeds all

00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,490
of this innovation happened because one

00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,440
team decided to challenge the

00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,140
assumptions of 12 metre yacht design it

00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,230
was controversial it was risky but it

00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,890
worked and yacht racing has not been the

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:41,559
same since

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,809
and just to nail the metaphor home the

00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:47,230
name of Australia - his tender boat was

00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:48,520
the Black Swan what does this have to do

00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,799
with Python well I think we have already

00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,869
seen a winged keel for our industry and

00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:54,970
its wisdom those who haven't come across

00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:56,319
it whether MS webassembly it started

00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,150
life as a research project trying to

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,099
identify the set of primitive JavaScript

00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,809
operations that will execute fast in a

00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:03,730
modern JavaScript engine that set of

00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:04,839
primitives is very close to the

00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,000
capabilities of assembly language

00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,799
allocating memory simple integer

00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,140
floating point operations and so on and

00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:13,839
as a result you can use that set of

00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,170
primitives and compile C code to this

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,030
assembly language target wisdom is the

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,280
extension of this work defining a binary

00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,049
format for transmitting assembly content

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,670
rather than transmitting JavaScript that

00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:27,040
has to be parsed and interpreted that

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,530
makes wise encodes smaller and faster

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,839
the process but no less portable than

00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:34,299
JavaScript because at the end of the day

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,980
it is JavaScript essentially it's

00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:38,380
separating JavaScript into true parts a

00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,880
fast sandboxed runtime that is almost

00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,520
universally available because it's in

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,380
the browser and a language that targets

00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,390
that runtime for the purposes of our

00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,900
industry it means that the rules have

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,059
changed

00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,220
you no longer have to adopt Java scripts

00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:54,040
the language to adopt javascript to the

00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,780
runtime that means there's an opening

00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,490
for Python and other languages to that

00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,589
matter languages to be languages that

00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,900
are available for client-side logic in

00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:03,280
the browser where them is still in the

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,720
relatively early days there are still

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,010
some issues being worked out one of the

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,470
big ones being the interaction between

00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:11,049
the DOM and wisdom and making a viable

00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,339
wasm based Python will require some work

00:46:11,049 --> 00:46:14,740
there have been some experiments done in

00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:16,750
this space though but the wind Kiel has

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,490
been revealed what we do with this

00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,049
knowledge is up to us are we going to

00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,160
dig into the technology get creative

00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:23,020
with the rules determine how we can

00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,760
exploit those rules to our advantage and

00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,590
sail off in a flying boat

00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,930
or are we going to continue to race in

00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,780
flat keel 12-meter yachts and wonder why

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,440
we don't win races anymore

00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,240
but there's more we can learn from

00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Australia - Ben lexan was a very

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,880
talented yacht designer he did a

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,320
remarkable thing when he put winglets on

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,180
the bottom of this of Australia to his

00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,850
keel but he wasn't a competitive sailor

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,560
John Bertrand was an amazing skipper

00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,020
couldn't couldn't design a yacht to save

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,180
himself and there were 14 other people

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,530
on board the boat and an entire support

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,030
team on the tender and back at harbor

00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:55,060
ensuring those 15 sailors could be

00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,710
competitive sailing is a team sport you

00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,480
don't just need a top-notch engineer or

00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,220
skipper you need a wide range of skills

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,380
and it's only when all those skills come

00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:05,140
together in a will well oil team that

00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,150
you achieve success the same is true of

00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,440
software although there is a historical

00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,030
narrative about great software

00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,500
development being done by a sole HEPA

00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,630
tap hacker tapping away in their

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,760
basement that is almost never the case

00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,990
what we see today is the Python

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,730
community is the result of countless

00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,640
thousands of hours of effort from

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,650
countless thousands of people and being

00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,150
primarily software engineers code is

00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,560
often get the most attention and yes

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,150
writing good software takes a lot of

00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,640
effort and doing it well takes time and

00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:34,150
skill but that's only considering the

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:36,010
code any project especially one the size

00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,350
of Python is so much more than code

00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,180
project and team management is a skill

00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,460
graphic design and UI management is a

00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:45,100
skill developer relations is a skill

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,830
technical writing is a skill now okay

00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,660
those skills could be broadly considered

00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,340
in the remit of a well-rounded software

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,250
engineer but what about things that IV

00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,960
aren't even remotely software related

00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,640
who organizes community events who

00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,380
provides legal advice who handles

00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,880
communication and public relations who

00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,680
builds the relationships with potential

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,940
donors and managers fundraising who

00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,080
makes the strategic deals with the

00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,280
googles and the Microsoft's and the

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,660
Amazons of the world to make sure that

00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,270
Python is a supported language on

00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,530
product roadmaps it turns out there are

00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,990
people in the world who can't program

00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:17,350
you have remarkable skills that are very

00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:19,000
very useful in Australia to has another

00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,830
lesson here Ben lexan and his team

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,090
didn't do all this engineering work out

00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,040
of the goodness of their hearts

00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,990
competitive sailing has been described

00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,080
as the ability to stand in a cold shower

00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:31,000
tearing up hundred-dollar bills the

00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,280
Australia to challenge was bankrolled by

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,900
a gentleman named Alan bond the 1983

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,760
challenge was the third challenge that

00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,530
bonded financed collectively absorbing

00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,840
hundreds of millions

00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,820
of dollars without bonds money the

00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,860
Australia to challenge would not have

00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,480
happened and without a commitment over

00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,830
multiple Cup campaigns allowing the

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,510
design team to become deeply familiar

00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,280
with twelve men a yacht design funding

00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,810
the research effort it wouldn't have cut

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,600
would not have culminated in a winged

00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,880
keel whether it is competitive sailing

00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,270
or software expertise is needed but

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,500
experts kind of expect to get paid from

00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,060
inside the bubble of open-source

00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,320
software development it is easy to lose

00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,870
sight of the facts of some of the

00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,750
cultural norms we see aren't normal in

00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,950
other industries open-source software is

00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,270
an industry where apparently it's

00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,590
expected there having worked your

00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,420
nine-to-five day job doing something

00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,850
that you are skilled at you will go home

00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,930
and do some more for free and then

00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,190
encourage a multi-billion dollar

00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:24,160
organization to benefit from your

00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:26,050
efforts in most industries if you're

00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,690
good at something you get paid to do it

00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,970
and people outside software have really

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:34,420
useful skills skills that many open

00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:36,820
source projects badly need but it's true

00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,890
of writing software two people are paid

00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,330
well to write software but there is

00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,730
plenty of software that should be

00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:44,200
written but isn't or isn't written in a

00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,060
timely fashion because we are waiting

00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,030
for volunteers to do the job

00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:51,700
Jango is a web framework and it took the

00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,530
DSF over three years to coordinate the

00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,900
most recent web design redesign of its

00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,370
website why because if you need

00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,960
volunteers you are immediately

00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,700
constraining the amount of time and

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,620
effort that anyone can put into the job

00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,300
and I don't want to undermine the

00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,650
significant contribution that volunteers

00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,150
have given to Python and the Python

00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,070
community but I do want to challenge the

00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,140
idea that volunteering is the only way

00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,840
that Python or open-source can progress

00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,340
if you pay people for their time they

00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,020
are much more likely to better maintain

00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,820
their attention on a problem until

00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,560
designs are fleshed out or consequences

00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,560
are considered and the work gets done

00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,460
we saw an amazing example of this in the

00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,280
Python community with the rewrite of pi

00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,590
pi pi pi has been around for 15 years

00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,230
it has badly needed a rewrite for almost

00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,060
half of its life everyone agreed a

00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:43,700
rewrite was needed but the work never

00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:46,100
got finished why because nobody was

00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,570
being paid to work on it then Mozilla

00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,710
gave the PSF a grant of a hundred and

00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:51,260
seventy thousand dollars and the work

00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,880
was done in six months why because a

00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,530
couple of people could focus on getting

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,360
the job done instead of trying to fit

00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,770
bug fixes in on weekends between their

00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,030
kids football games or trying to

00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,920
convince their boss that although

00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,110
improving pi pi won't make us any money

00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,380
in the next quarter it's a worthwhile

00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:09,260
activity for the community part the eye

00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,420
is an unfortunately rare example what

00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,280
opportunities have we left on the table

00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,740
or are we at the risk of leaving on the

00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,870
table because we aren't resourcing them

00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,850
what constraints have we placed on our

00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,530
own growth because nobody was

00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,450
enthusiastic enough to volunteer their

00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,850
time to address some gap or make the

00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,740
most of some opportunity and who have we

00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,180
excluded from the development process

00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,400
because they had other life commitments

00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,290
or couldn't justify donating all their

00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,120
spare time to a volunteer effort or

00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,800
because they can't take up a short-term

00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,150
grant contract because they live in the

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,480
United States and need health care

00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:43,070
coverage it's not just about maintenance

00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,290
and existing infrastructure either

00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:47,510
history has shown that research and

00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:50,270
development is how you ensure success in

00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:54,260
the long term and groups that don't do

00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:55,760
R&D eventually get beaten Australia twos

00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,290
investment in the R&D led to the wind

00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,450
kill and kick-started a whole generation

00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:01,310
of progress in yacht design the black

00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,570
swans I identified earlier aren't

00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,340
something that can be addressed in a

00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,170
trivial fix they're going to need a

00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,270
concentrated effort probably a bunch of

00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,620
dead ends along the way I have been

00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,300
doing what I can with beware but I'm

00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,940
really only doing that on weekends and

00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,100
the same is true of a lot of Python and

00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,050
the Python ecosystem for the most part

00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,430
the Python we have today has been

00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,560
developed in the spare time of

00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:23,180
volunteers or whatever fragments of time

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,940
engineers have been able to extract from

00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:28,790
their employers what if it didn't have

00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,740
to be that way what if Python had an R&D

00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,720
division a permanent engineering group

00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,710
that could focus on strategic tasks for

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,710
the Python ecosystem

00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:44,270
[Applause]

00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,830
when bill telephones gave a bunch of

00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:48,680
engineers the resources to engineer

00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:50,390
strategically we got unix when xerox

00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,370
funded a team in palo alto to engineer

00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,900
strategically we got Xerox PARC which

00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,970
gave us graphical user interfaces and

00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,490
Ethernet and laser printers when you

00:52:55,970 --> 00:53:01,580
give talented people the resources to

00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:04,730
think big amazing things can happen the

00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,470
Python community has talented people we

00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:08,120
just need to give them the resources to

00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:10,340
think big thoughts to do big things

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,660
without the need to demonstrate that the

00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,490
water or the work is going to generate

00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,020
profits in the next quarter or without

00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,460
the need to spend half their time on one

00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,340
grant writing the proposal for the next

00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,230
grant and it could give a could open the

00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,150
door to giving a high profile paid

00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,890
career opportunity to groups that have

00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,190
been historically underrepresented in

00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:30,110
open-source development the underlying

00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:32,510
problem we have though is how do we pay

00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:34,100
for this open source is an amazing way

00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,290
to do engineering but it is not a

00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,810
business model we need to work out how

00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,030
to fund our engineering goals in open

00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:43,760
source without compromising the social

00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,290
goals this problem is an area of

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,600
academic economics research though

00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,430
Elinor Ostrom won the 2009 Nobel Prize

00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,340
for economics for a study of common pool

00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:54,320
resources or CPRS real world examples of

00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,900
CPRS are things like forests or grazing

00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,210
lands they are situations where anyone

00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,240
can access the resource the best

00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:04,040
individual strategy is to take as much

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,020
as you can get from that resource but

00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,120
the best communal strategy is to

00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:10,340
collaborate to limit what you take to

00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,350
contribute back to maintain the resource

00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,490
so that in the long run the health and

00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,830
productivity of the resource is

00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,570
maximized Austrians work looked at

00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:19,580
examples of common pool resources that

00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,050
are being managed in the real world

00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,660
some of them have been collectively

00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:26,990
operated and maintained for hundreds of

00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,280
years one of the key findings of

00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,860
Austin's work are the conditions

00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,490
required for sustainable CPRS and one of

00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:36,680
those conditions is exclusion in order

00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:38,210
to sustain a common pool resource you

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,130
have to be able to restrict access to

00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,310
the resource to those that are committed

00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:45,080
to adhering to community principles the

00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,760
problem is that this is in direct

00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,440
opposition to the free software

00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,390
guidelines which states you can't

00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,839
restrict the ability of people to

00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:55,729
redistribute software I don't know

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,439
how we reconcile those two positions it

00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:59,150
may require some very serious

00:54:57,439 --> 00:55:01,249
consideration of some ideas that we have

00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,650
considered sacred for a very long time

00:55:01,249 --> 00:55:05,479
or at the very least drawing a clear

00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,609
distinction between the software and the

00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:10,759
communities around them but we can't

00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:13,579
avoid these discussions the consequences

00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:16,069
of this discrepancy are having have had

00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:18,259
a very deep impact on people in our

00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:19,609
community to that end I've got one last

00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:21,349
piece of sandgroper history I'd like to

00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:22,609
share with you and as it heads up we're

00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:25,009
about to get into the sensitive topics

00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:27,349
that I flagged earlier this dapper

00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:30,859
gentleman is Charles Yelverton O'Connor

00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:32,449
CY O'Connor born in 1843 he became the

00:55:30,859 --> 00:55:34,339
engineering chief of the Public Works

00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:36,589
Department of Western Australia in 1891

00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:38,150
he had a wide range of responsibilities

00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:40,459
but there were two major public works

00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:43,160
that he is remembered for the first is

00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:45,459
Fremantle harbour Perth is actually a

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,569
really dumb place for a large city to be

00:55:45,459 --> 00:55:49,789
okay sure it's a long way away from

00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:53,209
everything but cities on the ocean need

00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:54,259
harbors Perth doesn't have a natural

00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:57,259
deepwater Harbor

00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:58,999
so they made one and they did that by

00:55:57,259 --> 00:56:00,499
dredging the mouth of the Swan River and

00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:04,029
this was done under the direction and

00:56:00,499 --> 00:56:06,259
supervision of CY O'Connor in the 1890s

00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:08,479
but that wasn't O'Connor's only

00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:10,219
achievement his other was even bigger

00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:12,469
the goldfields water scheme in the early

00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:14,449
1890s gold was discovered near the towns

00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,089
of Cole Guardi and Cal gully this

00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:18,380
started the Western Australian Gold Rush

00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:21,199
these towns as you may know it from the

00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:23,689
map are in the middle of a desert there

00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:26,479
is no natural water source out there but

00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:29,029
people need water so they would pay five

00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:31,519
shillings a gallon to have water carted

00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:36,829
by horse from Perth adjusted for

00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:39,339
inflation that's us $100 a gallon there

00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:42,739
was so much gold that people paid anyway

00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:44,150
the 1890s Goldfield Gold Rush doubled

00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:47,299
the population of Western Australia in

00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,589
four years but people were still dying

00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:50,449
of thirst and disease so the government

00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:52,849
wanted to do something CY O'Connor

00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:55,219
solution was a pipeline running 530

00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:56,599
kilometres 330 miles from Mundaring

00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:58,009
we're in the Perth Hills to cut

00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:59,539
Kalgoorlie with a series of eight

00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:01,219
pumping stations along the route to get

00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:03,380
water to the destination lifting the

00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:06,079
water 340 meters in altitude across its

00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,760
length it takes five days for a drop of

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,550
water to make its way from Monday

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:14,030
- kalgoorlie and again this was built in

00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:15,560
the 1890s Fremantle harbour and the

00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,540
goldfields pipeline were conceived

00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,820
planned and delivered in the eras of

00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:22,940
horse-drawn carts and steam engines

00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:25,130
they were both mammoth undertakings it

00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,330
took considerable financial commitment

00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:29,540
from the government of the day to make

00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:32,110
them happen but like all ambitious plans

00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,610
they were not universally popular

00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:36,980
criticism of these two projects was

00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:38,450
widespread people who had alternate

00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,850
plans that have been rejected took to

00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:42,920
the presses to express their dismay two

00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:45,320
successive editors of Perth Sunday Times

00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,570
newspaper made it their personal mission

00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,220
to see o'connor brought to account for

00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,960
the way that he was wasting public funds

00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,640
they took every opportunity in

00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,260
editorials - accusing of corruption of

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,650
ineptitude calling for a Royal

00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,840
Commission into his activities and all

00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:02,240
this public criticism and pressure took

00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:06,770
its toll on O'Connor one early morning

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,780
in 1902 he took his own life these two

00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:10,550
projects Fremantle harbour in the Gulf

00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,140
fields pipeline they were ambitious but

00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,090
they weren't foolhardy they were

00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:16,280
well-designed they were well engineered

00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,620
and they have shaped Western Australia

00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,000
they have both been in continuous

00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,670
operation from the day they were

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,070
commissioned Kalgoorlie is to this day

00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:27,800
an active goldmine one of the world's

00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,480
largest and children are taught cy

00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,100
O'Connor's name and story in primary

00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,530
school because of the importance of the

00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,600
work he did but the combination of the

00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,610
public narrative about his work and his

00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:41,690
own mental health issues led to the

00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:43,340
worst possible end unfortunately this is

00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,960
a story that will sound familiar to

00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:47,110
anyone who has been around open-source

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,490
communities for any period of time I

00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:51,290
have been a part of open online

00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:53,000
communities for 30 years and maintain us

00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:55,180
from was 15 and I'm here to tell you

00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,880
dealing with people is emotionally

00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:00,770
exhausting the sense of entitlement that

00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,570
some people bring to discussions about a

00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,550
tool they have received at no cost

00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:07,760
without any obligation to give back in

00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:09,470
any way is phenomenal and dealing with

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,930
the messy parts of community so that

00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:15,170
everybody else doesn't have to is just

00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:17,060
as exhausting over time those pressures

00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:18,980
add up and when you are doing all of

00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,190
that emotional and emotional and mental

00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,410
labor as a Valen

00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,940
here it makes you question why you

00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:26,490
bother at all

00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,990
my personal experience I was diagnosed

00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,630
as being in the middle of a major

00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:32,730
depressive episode in 2015 now there

00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:34,650
were a number of contributing factors

00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,150
but one of the big ones was the

00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,740
pressures imposed by my volunteer work

00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:39,240
dealing with the Django community in

00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,859
particular dealing with code of conduct

00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,319
issues and one particular code of

00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:45,930
conduct issue in particular I burned out

00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:47,280
on the Django community I am still part

00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,990
of that community because of the many

00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,000
amazing people and friends that I've

00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,700
made but I don't actively contribute

00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,530
anywhere near as much as I once did I

00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:56,940
can think of dozens of others who have

00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:58,349
had similar experiences who have either

00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,849
scaled back they're involved in an

00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:01,230
open-source or dropped out of the

00:59:59,849 --> 01:00:02,520
community entirely because of the

01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,099
treatment they have received at the

01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,990
hands of others in our community now

01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,819
fortunately I never reached the point of

01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:09,900
contemplating self-harm I was able to

01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:11,880
find the help that I needed before

01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:15,500
reaching that point but I know people

01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:17,670
who have are we as a community

01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:20,339
comfortable that we are doing this to

01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:22,890
our peers to our leaders or to anyone

01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:24,300
for that matter do we want to build our

01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,310
community on the expectation that

01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,500
volunteers will give of themselves until

01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:31,440
they burn out are we okay with the idea

01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,030
of project founders martyring themselves

01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,160
so that the wider community can have

01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:36,900
access to a web framework or a packaging

01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,730
service or a numerical processing

01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,410
library or do we want to find a way to

01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,359
structure our community to make sure

01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:44,160
that people who are able to do good work

01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:46,109
have the resources to do what they do

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,670
well and access to others who can

01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:49,829
actively support them in that work and

01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:54,089
access to individuals with skills in

01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:56,220
other areas ten years ago Python 3 was

01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:57,720
released despite numerous cries that it

01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,400
would kill Python we have come out the

01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,960
other side as a larger stronger

01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,569
community the transition to Python 3

01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,310
required some bold vision bold technical

01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:07,230
decisions and ok maybe some mistakes

01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:10,290
were made but ultimately the gambit

01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:12,300
appears to have worked that success was

01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,760
not inevitable it took planning and

01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,770
effort and future success isn't

01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,290
inevitable either so what about the next

01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:21,210
10 years what can you do to help well

01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:22,650
firstly we need to start thinking about

01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,630
the black swans that have the potential

01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:26,190
to redefine us we can't afford to just

01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:28,710
think about the most pressing problems

01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,359
that are obvious right now our immediate

01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:32,369
sources of pain up and immediate

01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:33,930
potential sources of revenue we need to

01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:35,670
think about the problems we are going

01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,920
you have because addressing those

01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:39,390
problems may take some time and by the

01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,720
time those black swans become the

01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:43,829
pressing problem it may be too late

01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,569
secondly we need to improve our

01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:47,430
resourcing of maintenance and R&D

01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:49,410
efforts we need to work out how to

01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,970
harness the not insignificant amount of

01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,099
money that is available in our industry

01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,079
to do the work that we collectively need

01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:57,780
to have done and part of that discussion

01:01:55,079 --> 01:02:00,210
may mean rethinking aspects of the way

01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,890
our community operates reshaping the

01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,900
nature of the financial relationship we

01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,930
have with users and especially large

01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,920
organizations who have resources and

01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,540
third as a community we need to

01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,730
re-evaluate the way that we value

01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,619
contributors and their contributions and

01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:15,540
as a simplistic reading yeah okay I mean

01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:16,859
money give them access to the resources

01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,450
they need to continue doing the work

01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:20,309
they're doing or to scale up the work

01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:23,069
from a part-time volunteer effort to a

01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:25,319
permanent facility but I don't just mean

01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:27,450
money we need to value each other as

01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:29,130
human beings when you see something

01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,680
online and you've got some hot take that

01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:34,230
you've got a post think about whether it

01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,270
needs to be said and if it does need to

01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:38,970
be said are you saying it in a

01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:41,040
constructive empathetic way consider the

01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:42,809
collective effort of a thousand messages

01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,119
of the same tone being directed at

01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:48,180
someone who volunteered to do something

01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,740
to help you okay those are still very

01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,970
high level calls to action those are

01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,349
things that require discussion and

01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,760
planning and ongoing contemplation the

01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:55,049
rest of this conference it's a great

01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,369
time to have those discussions but we're

01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:57,869
not going to see a magical fix by this

01:02:56,369 --> 01:03:00,119
time next week you want something

01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:03,319
concrete well here's two more first off

01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:03,319
get out your wallets

01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,250
the platen Software Foundation currently

01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:14,530
has it's a fundraising drive it's just

01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:17,050
opened the Django Software Foundation um

01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:19,060
focused many other organizations accept

01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:21,040
donations encourage your employer to

01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:23,320
support these organizations to a level

01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,780
that reflects their significance to your

01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:28,089
business give those organizations the

01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:30,520
financial resources to do maintenance

01:03:28,089 --> 01:03:33,130
and R&D work on behalf of the community

01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,480
if you would like to support my own work

01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,800
in the beware project you can join the

01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,599
project as a financial member I am

01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,630
currently able to cover hosting costs

01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,160
paper stickers and challenge coins if

01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,359
you can get some more if I can get some

01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,589
more financial backing I could start

01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,270
making a more substantial time

01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:47,560
commitment to beware if you've got other

01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,700
ideas about how to fund beware or you

01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,050
want to know more about the project we

01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,540
have a booth in the main hall come and

01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,650
have a chat but lastly if you have the

01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,570
means all your privilege allows

01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:57,609
contribute whether that's on your own

01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:59,380
time on your employer's time consider

01:03:57,609 --> 01:04:01,510
contributing to open source projects no

01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:04,630
matter your level of experience this is

01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:05,349
a collective effort and every little bit

01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,420
helps

01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:09,070
the beware project definitely needs help

01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,599
but so do dozens of other projects in

01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:12,160
the Python ecosystem and if my

01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,109
experience is a sandgroper proves

01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,240
everything anything it is that open

01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:20,710
source really does open up the world to

01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:22,060
you it has taken 28 years for Python to

01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:23,710
get to where we are today and it would

01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,750
be a shame to have to develop it all

01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,920
over again simply because we didn't pay

01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,780
attention to the way the world is

01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,099
changing and planned for how Python will

01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,260
fit into the world that is evolving

01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:34,300
around us and as Python the language

01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:36,369
grows and adapts we need to make sure

01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:38,170
that our community grows and adapts as

01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,760
well this awesome language we know and

01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:41,680
love would be nothing without the

01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,780
community of people behind it and as

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,330
that community grows I want to see it

01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:47,230
grow from strength to strength I hope I

01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,760
have been able to convince you that

01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,680
Python still has a vibrant future ahead

01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,450
of it we just need to plan for that

01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:55,000
future and work out how we're going to

01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:57,940
execute on those plans in a sustainable

01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,990
fashion and if I haven't convinced you

01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,030
about pythons future maybe I've

01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,560
convinced you to come visit Perth we're

01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,390
a long way from everything but I promise

01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,990
were worth it not all the animals will

01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:10,250
kill you for example there is the

01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:12,480
happiest animal on earth the guaca--

01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:15,010
