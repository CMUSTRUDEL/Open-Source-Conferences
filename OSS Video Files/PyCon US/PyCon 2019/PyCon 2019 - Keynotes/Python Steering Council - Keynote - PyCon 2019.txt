	00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,660
good morning everybody my name is Enric

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,990
fake production engineer up in Facebook

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,170
Seattle those are unaware Facebook is a

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,900
platinum sponsor of the pipe icon yeah

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,780
the PSF and we're always very grateful

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,970
to be here at PyCon this is actually my

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,160
second PyCon first one was in 2010 so

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,899
I'm hoping to do at least another one in

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,600
the next decade those of you I know

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,309
where Facebook actually does use Python

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,069
quite a bit we're not just a PHP shop

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,940
from the mo obvious like data analysts

00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:47,010
and things like that

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,379
which is less obvious like our entire

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,420
configuration management system we also

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,780
use it quite a bit a little product

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,219
you've ever heard of called Instagram no

00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,649
personally wasn't a big Instagram user

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,389
until I got a puppy and all of a sudden

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,149
everybody want to throw his IG handle

00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:05,010
and I had to get one so IG uses quite a

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,950
few open solicit ecologies such as

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,370
celery Jango to help deliver those cute

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,470
puppy photos to your inbox every day

00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,390
now we're also proud to be a sponsor of

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,310
several open source projects like pi

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,380
torch which is a drop-in replacement for

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,940
numpy and actually lets you use a lot of

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,090
those juicy GPUs to get more performance

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,160
out of your software we also provide

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,630
Peyer which is a performant type

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,580
checking system which really speeds up

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,720
your testing and finally this is

00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,490
actually my favorite I just found out

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
about this one it's called monkey type

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,020
actually allows you to profile your code

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,820
and it will actually provide stubs or

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,380
directly annotate your code to

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,550
automatically add type hints which

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,700
honestly blew my mind now I'm extremely

00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,050
proud to be at Facebook we are very

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,850
grateful to be here

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,290
we're very thankful for all of your

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,840
contributions to the Python community

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,840
and of course to the rest of the world

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,850
without no further ado I want to give a

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,330
brief thanks to the Python or the Python

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,770

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,459
council my name is Eva I'm the executive

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,799

00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,319
Foundation which is the nonprofit behind

00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,949
Python I'll be the moderator for this

session

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:20,429
pythons governance recently shifted from

00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:24,209
the be DFL model sorry I got my my

00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:25,769
clicker to a steering council if you're

00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:28,169
in Turin interested in reading about

00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:31,979
this change and how it was achieved you

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,989
can check out these links above we are

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,849
here to learn more about the steering

00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:37,589
council members what the steering

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,110
council does and learn about their

00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,029
mandates at the end of the panel we'll

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,229
open the floor to audience questions so

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,519
please start thinking about what you'd

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,959
like to ask now so on stage with me we

00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,719
have the five steering council members

00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,909
we have Barry Warsaw Brett cannon Carol

00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:56,519
willing cuido van Rossum and Nick

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,439
Coghlan before we get into what the

00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,719
steering Council does let's get to know

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,879
you all a bit you can tell us things

00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:04,619
like why you became a core developer or

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,929
in Guido's case why you even created

00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:08,849
Python what types of Python development

00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:11,579
interests you projects you've used

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:18,959
Python for and so on Barry let's start

00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:20,819
with you okay well thanks so I I work at

00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,999
LinkedIn and I'm on the Python

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,399
Foundation team many of my teammates are

00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:28,529
here which is awesome we do a lot of

00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,939
Python we basically support Python at

00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:36,989
LinkedIn you know I I think I've told my

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:38,729
story many times this is Guido van

00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,549
Rossum is Python world tour

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:44,449
it happened in 1994 in Gaithersburg

00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:47,669
Maryland and that's when I met Guido

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:52,379
fell in love with Python and Guido of

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:54,689
course and I think you know just like

00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,919
not going away as part of the part of

00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,639
the trick right sticking around long

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,090
enough I there were 20 people at the

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,370
first Python workshop

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,700
which is pretty amazing to look out at

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,490
this crowd I think all of us knew Python

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,020
was really special when we first were

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,400
introduced to it and we certainly knew

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:17,410
Guido was very special but to see where

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,200
both the language and the community has

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,090
gone in 25 years no one none of us could

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,580
have expected it and I I think it's kind

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,730
of miraculous actually because it's not

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,740
only changed the tech landscape but it's

00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:33,010
changed all of our lives you know I I

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,659
know certainly for myself I wouldn't

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,560
have the life I have without Python

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:41,409
so I'm amazingly you know grateful for

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,130
that great story many of us are in the

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,680
same boat right how about you yeah so

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,470
I'm a dev manager for the Python

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,120
exception for vyas code at Microsoft's

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,860
where I could do that

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,480
most of the time but any spare time I

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,120
get workloads to make Street just spend

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,220
on Python itself in terms of how I got

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,880
started it was slightly long story but

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,370
the the gist of it is I got the recipe

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,930
in the Python cookbook it was not

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,339
perfect it drove me nuts for about a

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,220
year I figured out how to make it

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,810
perfect ice in my mind and then Alex

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,950
Martelli the editor I asked how do I get

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,930
this into Python because I think other

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,800
people might find it useful I said oh

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:24,010
email this mailing is called Python dev

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,870
so I did in June of 2002 I believe of

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,910
Skip Montanaro actually who responded

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,280
told me how to do it and go through the

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,660
workflow I did it it got accepted I was

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,450
there any gap here between my undergrad

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,310
and my graduate program start so I

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,650
figured wow this is fun I'll keep doing

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,640
this and lo and behold I kept doing

00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:45,430
enough that eventually I asked I I do a

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,390
PR for something and then I just said I

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,160
need someone to merge it and great I

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,200
said well I'll get someone to give you

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,310
McBride she was much of yourself I think

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,010
I was just bothering everyone a whole to

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:58,630
much and just been involved ever since

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,709
basically I I'm somewhat known for a

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,910
phrase where I said I came for the

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,160
language but I stayed for the community

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,450
and part of that is the people up on

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,610
this stage and though I've gotten to

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,560
work with an O of the ears from the dev

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,890
team I basically learned how to program

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,660
honestly from these people and I've just

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,529
become great friends and that's why I

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,049
keep coming back

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:20,379
year after year community is a great

00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,539
aspect Carol how about you I'm Carol

00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:26,979
Willick thank you all for being here I

00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:28,689
am back in 2016 I did a keynote in the

00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:31,419
Philippines and I talked about how

00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:34,629
Python was the people's programming

00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:37,929
language and when I started back in 2012

00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:41,109
using Python as a person I thought this

00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:43,029
is really fun to program in and then I

00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:46,809
also got involved with Jupiter notebooks

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:50,289
and thought this is great stuff we can

00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:52,089
spread learning about Python learning

00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:54,219
about different disciplines whether it's

00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:58,959
science data science embedded computing

00:10:54,219 --> 00:11:02,229
web stuff and I saw the power of it then

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,649
and I wanted to be a part of it and so I

00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:07,629
started more on the community side with

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,589
the Python Software Foundation and

00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:12,549
working with openhatch which was a

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,859
non-profit that helped people make their

00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:18,159
first contribution to open-source and

00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:22,929
through that I started learning the core

00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:26,679
Python workflow and what I really wanted

00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:29,169
was to from a technical standpoint learn

00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:33,609
how to be a core developer but even more

00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:37,649
so to develop processes and an

00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:40,779
environment where the core team reflects

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:43,839
how we use Python in the real world and

00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:46,509
who we serve because I think Python is

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,389
used to really touch so many people's

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:53,019
lives and it will be for the next 20 or

00:11:49,389 --> 00:12:00,189
so years so it's up to all of us to make

00:11:53,019 --> 00:12:03,789
it better year by year oh that was so

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:05,470
wonderful to hear I don't even know what

00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:11,949
the question is because the sound here

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:15,669
is terrible on stage about myself well I

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:17,979
was a programmer I was on an environment

00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:21,489
where there wasn't a language that I

00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:25,839
liked so I made one out of pieces that I

00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:28,060
had learned previously and because I

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,060
can't write code

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,240
and not have other people use it I made

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:44,380
it open source and the rest was really

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:49,860
the community so fast forward to last

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:54,400
year when I was like like at the top of

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:58,000
responsibilities controversial peps left

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,430
and right and I had a case of burnout

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
where I thought I've done this almost 30

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:07,000
years being the BD FL of this language

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,370
it's time for someone else or some other

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,060
structure and so I announced that one

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:17,070
day I literally did not the night before

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:19,300
I had approved a very controversial pep

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:23,770
you may be familiar with The Walrus

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:26,080
operator the next morning I woke up and

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,960
I thought I don't want to be BD FL

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,010
anymore and I spent 20 minutes drafting

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,230
a nice email to the core developers

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,650
asking them to go take care of

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,050
themselves I mean it was really like

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,970
what are you going to do do sort of set

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,370
up some government do it do it however

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:53,130
you think is there what you think is the

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:56,140
right way to do and it was such a relief

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,970
but I know you know how this goes when

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,490
your kid goes off to college some of you

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,230
may have experience with that I will

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:07,630
soon have that experience you're no

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:11,460
longer directly involved in their lives

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:14,800
maybe but you never stop worrying and

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,790
that's how I feel about Python at the

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,790
moment and that's why I

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,240
[Applause]

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:30,020
why I nominated myself for the steering

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:33,440
committee and Here I am nicked on

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,870
something about yourself so for me I

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,300
actually came to Python as a hardware

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:44,300
and C C++ guy because I needed to test

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,470
some signal processing code and Python

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,050
had the unit test module

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:51,440
it had the wave module and it had this

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:57,080
thing called swig to let me wrap ow

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,600
C++ drivers and so I did that for

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,640
hardware control for comm systems and

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,540
then now I do it for electric vehicle

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:08,870
fast charges with tritium and it's just

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,940
this language that lets me reach out and

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,570
touch the real world without having to

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,810
worry about all the messy details and

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,029
and then I got involved in core dev just

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,790
this was this community of people on the

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:26,899
internet that talked about this language

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,610
and how do we make computers how we

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,490
bridge from that to the way people

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:35,600
actually think and just make that more

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,339
accessible and make it make it yeah talk

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,339
to the computer the way you think and

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:44,750
have it do what you meant is kind of

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,370
amazing and a lot of fun we're all very

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,709
grateful to have your experiences and

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,089
backgrounds part of our community we

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:53,000
don't now that you've experienced being

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:55,310
both PDF elf Python as well as the

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,839
steering council member tell us how do

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,740
you think governance has changed and

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:03,680
will continue to change I'm sorry I did

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,290
not hear toufool ah now that you've

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,149
experienced beating being be DFL and

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,980
also part of the steering council

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,709
committee committee how do you think

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,990
that the governance has changed and will

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,990
continue to change of Python okay yeah

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,350
so while I was btfl sort of the way it

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,180
felt to me and I think the way it felt

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:31,010
to most other people as well was

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:33,209
whenever there was some controversial

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:37,499
decision it would eventually

00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:40,679
bubble up to me which meant that I was

00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:42,720
always scanning Python dev and Python

00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,629
ideas for things that might become

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,709
controversial and trying to nip it in

00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:52,170
the bud if I could and every pep

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,689
basically eventually became my

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,829
responsibility after the people with the

00:16:54,689 --> 00:17:01,529
the greater domain knowledge and

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,839
expertise had that sort of sorted it out

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:09,799
to the point where they they had a

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:14,130
yes/no question or an a/b choice and

00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:17,159
that's pretty stressful and so I'm very

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:20,880
glad that sort of that responsibility is

00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:27,089
now divided distributed over five

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,039
experts who have more of the trust of

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:32,330
the community because they they've

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:38,159
actually been voted in rather than just

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:39,380
become the leader or leaders by

00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:43,380
happenstance

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:46,289
so the voting has has sort of voting for

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,720
the steering council I think creates a

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:51,090
real different relationship between the

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,250
steering Council and the core deaf

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:57,690
community than what ever existed between

00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:01,370
the core devs and myself as B DFL going

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,169
forward I think that we're also

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,840
structuring the decision-making process

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:10,380
somewhat differently

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,960
the steering Council is not actually the

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,710
group of people who decide about most

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,039
steps anymore what's written in our

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:24,240
Constitution Feb 13 and what we sort of

00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:27,000
used as guidelines is that for most

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,460
decisions we actually pick an expert

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,210
from among the core devs and sometimes

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,210
external contributors that we know well

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:40,679
and we settled them with the question

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,480
and the decision and so far we've we've

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,899
only got a few months experience with

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,890
that process so far I think that is

00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:49,650
going great and

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:54,090
so going forward the steering council is

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:59,010
going to delegate whatever it can with

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:01,950
the understanding that the delegate who

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,710
decides eventually gets to report to the

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,730
steering counsel if delegates suddenly

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,830
turns around 180 degrees and does wild

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,380
things that the steering council think

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,930
that's too much or maybe that's too

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,420
little we can recall them but I expect

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:21,480
that we've very rare occurrence because

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:24,420
we we pick our people based on many

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,860
years of experience with their behavior

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:31,440
and their expertise and so a real

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,900
connection and Trust I think that's what

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
I have to say about the governance yeah

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,590
maybe in three years we'll get on stage

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,910
again and do this over see how it's

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:44,250
changed since now Python and data

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,530
science continues to grow in popularity

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,080
Carol you're also a project Jupiter

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,240
steering council member as the one with

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,100
the strongest hide to scientific Python

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,590
community can you tell us why it's

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,690
important for the scientific community

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:02,640
to have representation on the steering

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:05,880
console sure I think it's important in

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,870
general for the steering council to be

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:14,370
willing to listen to new ideas from all

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:18,060
areas of the community the needs that we

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,910
have in web and embedded education

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,970
science data science are gonna be

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,250
slightly different depending on you know

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,820
certain things most things will be very

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,220
similar but there will be specifics that

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,160
impact maybe the science world or the

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,170
education world more than others and I

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,820
think by having a variety of experiences

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,180
and backgrounds on the steering council

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,970
whether it's specifically science or

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:50,730
just what you've done technically is

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,050
important because I think the diversity

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,640
is what gives us better decisions better

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,970
understanding of what's happening out in

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,480
the community

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:04,150
and really trying to address where we

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:08,500
need to make improvements and where we

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:11,620
want to go forward and you know actually

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,330
trip blazed new trails so I think the

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,270
science community and the data science

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:19,120
community brings us a lot of technical

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:23,110
expertise and in many cases also

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,790
research opportunities as well so maybe

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:29,260
potentially some funding down the road

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:31,420
so I think it's a good thing Brett

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,640
you've managed a lot of hoard of

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,190
infrastructure work so I'll ask you

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,710
about pop Pet five eight one five eight

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:43,300
one authored by marietta outlines the

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:45,010
steps needed to hey Marietta needed to

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,120
migrate pythons issue tracker from

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,820
roundup to github

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,990
looking at the schedule even if I pet

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,570
five eight one was discussed at the

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,400
language summit on Thursday can you tell

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,430
us all a little bit about what was

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,570
discussed and what the next steps are

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:04,780
sure so pet five eight one as before

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:07,630
what a week ago two weeks ago outlined

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,310
the rationale of the idea of moving our

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,850
issue tracker from bug stop by Thunder

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:16,240
org over to github under our repo there

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:18,100
and as of a week ago I believe berry

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,930
took initial stab at actually splitting

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,210
up between keeping five eight one as the

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,950
rationale and pepped five eight eight I

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,310
believe as the actual steps that would

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,770
be taken to actually do the migration

00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:32,590
basically this abbis fall that is when

00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:35,020
we first formed the council we went

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,210
through all the open peps pepp 581 by

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,400
beretta in the front row was there and

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,530
so we discussed it we all agreed that we

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,400
are amenable to it no official decision

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:47,410
has been made though and we realized

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,940
that that pet need to be split up at the

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,540
language summit i'm area two presented

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,180
on it

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,770
we took some feedback from the room

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,960
about what people thought and such what

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,730
we thought might need to happen we've

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,090
started to have initial discussions with

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,580
even the PSF about potentially trying to

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,500
have a PM sort of role to help handle

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,140
the migration because we realize that if

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,770
we go forward with this the migration of

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,350
those issues is going to be

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,750
critical and we don't want any problems

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,700
because lord knows I've had my own

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,840
handful and those over the years moving

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,240
our infrastructure around so basically

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,740
at this point it's it's at we all think

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,990
it's a good idea no official decision

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,240
has been made and we are talking to you

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,130
about how to make sure we can get that

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,270
staffed and handled appropriately if and

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,360
when we decide to go forward with it

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,640
absolutely keep that process going Nick

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,720
you're also a member of the PSFS grants

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,640
workgroup I'm sorry packaging workgroup

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,260
last year the Worker rolled out the

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,450
warehouse code base thanks to the

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,910
Mozilla grants at the PSF received which

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,340
made several improvements in March of

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,860
this year the workgroup launched work

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,180
for the next set of improvements which

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,960
will be around security and

00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,900
accessibility

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,660
what do you now as a steering council

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,540
member think should be the next steps or

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,900
you know features or improvements that

00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,390
the packaging workgroup should take so

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,340
one of the points I like to make is the

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,940
two roles I suspect is surprisingly

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:18,380
separate for a lot of people that

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,570
there's the Python packaging Authority

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,270
which uses the packaging working group

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,820
to essentially coordinate with PSF and

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,790
then python core development and the

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,410
steering council in a similar role again

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,290
working with the PSF for a resource

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,030
management that kind of thing so I think

00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,860
on the steering council side we have

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,110
some work to do clarifying those

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,760
relationships and making them clear to

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,370
the wider community not just the folks

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:47,720
involved but on the actual Python

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,520
packaging index side the with the

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,880
authentication stuff that's currently in

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,890
progress with the open tech fund after

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
that there's a lot that could be done

00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,730
around improving the publisher

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,430
experience we've put a lot in recent

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,890
years in terms of improving the pi PI

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:06,680
consumer experience but on the publisher

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,810
side releases are getting a lot more

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,520
complicated so people are wanting to

00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,810
upload source distributions plus

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,900
multiple wheels for different platforms

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:17,390
and different Python versions and at the

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,340
moment the packing index is kind of this

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,020
instant publish thing like you push it

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,870
up it's done it's like you committed

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,580
that's it no changes it's out there

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,160
and we'd really like to be able to offer

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,840
a staging area where people can put up

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,920
all the artifacts for release make sure

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,810
everything's in order make sure

00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,430
everything's there and then once they're

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,790
happy with the release push button and

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,740
have it go publish so yes so there's

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,320
some ideas around how to do that

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,810
but yeah I think that's one of the next

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,360
big areas of improvement coming down the

00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,410
pipeline continuing improvements is

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,880
gonna be something we need to

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,740
concentrate on and I know that's

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,120
packaging somebody's happening the first

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,580
day of Sprint's as well so I'm sure

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,370
other ideas will come out of that berry

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,470
as one of the authors of pep one and and

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,440
the entire Pett process as it is can you

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,830
tell us about how that pet process has

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,250
changed with the new governance model

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:13,710
sure so you know peps the idea of peps

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,710
kind of came out of Guido in my time at

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:20,010
CNRI because see nor I ran the IETF so

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:23,370
we were sort of familiar with RFC's and

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:25,290
internet standards and I thought that

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,840
would be a good format although I wanted

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:30,030
something much more lightweight that

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,220
would just just be enough process for us

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,320
to get our work done without being too

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:39,720
much process I don't you know now how

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,550
successful that but and and the purpose

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,440
of the pep was so that Guido didn't have

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,450
to go through thousands of emails and

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,100
try to figure out what the what the

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:51,030
actual proposal was so that he could

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,740
just read one document and get an idea

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,960
of both the pros and the cons for a

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,730
particular proposal and then make a

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,940
decision and then we would record that

00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:03,420
that entire process the decision-making

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,430
process within the peps at you know as

00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,080
Guido alluded to you know all those

00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,850
decisions kind of funneled through him

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,360
and I think that that became untenable

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:14,580
for many reasons partly I think because

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,520
there's aspects of this amazing

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,530
ecosystem that you just you know other

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,200
people or better maybe better equipped

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,470
to decide or Guido just doesn't really

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,850
isn't really involved in that so then we

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,820
came up with the idea of the delegates

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,220
the B DFL delegates who we could who

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,500
Guido could say that's an expert we're

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,440
gonna let that person make the decision

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,770
on this

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,420
feature we talked about this a little

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:45,700
bit earlier and the steering council BFL

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,100
delegate was sort of a last resort it

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,220
was for the things that Guido wanted not

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,080
to be involved in and I think with the

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,710
new governance model it's really sort of

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,180
the first resort you know we're we don't

00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,440
want to make those decisions if there

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,590
are people in the community who are

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,820
better equipped to do that that's what

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,240
we want to do we want to we want to

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,360
allow other people to become engaged

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,760
with shaping where Python is going to go

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,580
in the next 25 years and I think that's

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,860
really important because you know none

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,670
of us are getting younger certainly

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:23,110
sorry now speak for myself and the

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,980
Python community is so much bigger now

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,650
right so this gives the next generation

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,230
of Python leaders an opportunity to step

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,210
up become involved make important

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,910
decisions that will shape the language

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,470
and eventually move into those

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,800
leadership roles and I think that that's

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,450
the way we keep the community healthy

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,030
and keep the language healthy and

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,470
vibrant for the next 25 years so I'm

00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,230
actually really excited about I'm really

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,480
glad that we've sort of moved to much

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,800
more delegation and there'll be if there

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,870
are a few peps where we're kind of

00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,210
keeping for ourselves because we might

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,150
think that they're sort of more

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,640
appropriate for the electeds during

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,200
council to to decide but you know we

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,450
work with the delegates and we work with

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,010
the the pep authors to to come up with

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,880
the right solution there sounds like a

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,790
great change

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,580
so now asking the entire group do you

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,590
all consider implementations of Python

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,860
part of the scope of the steering

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:26,470
council preview or do you just focus on

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:29,860
the language itself I'll take that one

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:33,760
we totally see implementations of Python

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:38,500
as something that we care about and that

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,560
we should care about and where we we our

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:45,010
discussion we're discussing our thoughts

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,770
about how should we move the language

00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,250
and the implementation or

00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:53,470
implementations forward

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:57,990
and just ask the audience how many

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,990
people still use Python to in the room

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,720
so Python 2 will not be maintained past

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,050
2019 the sunset is around the corner

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,220
only about 8 months away so what's the

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:30,730
game plan for Python two's retirement

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:32,920
party I know that we spoke about the

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,230
possibility of hiring a PM and that

00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,450
person is going to probably be tasked

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,920
with communication and directing people

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,720
to the right place but can give us a

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,540
little bit more information on things

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,530
like that yeah I mean I think the

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,190
planets are moving forward they're not

00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:49,660
gonna change thank goodness and as

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,600
you've alluded to we are starting to

00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:56,080
talk about potentially having a p.m.

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,429
come forward to help us sunset and just

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,570
figure out all the little minor details

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:03,340
because obviously for instance search

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,210
for something in the standard library

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,429
right now

00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,850
search engines often go to doc stop

00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:11,590
python.org / - which obviously slash 2.7

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,590
which is not the version you're all

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,059
going to care about starting in 2020

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,559
various other things on the website and

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,510
the documentation where it says 2 & 3

00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:22,750
because starting in 2020 there's just

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,100
Python because we won't really have to

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,710
care about the number the major never as

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,120
much anymore so just little details like

00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,280
that I think still need to get worked

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,750
out but otherwise this train is very

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:36,160
much moving for and it's gonna hit that

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:39,309
date whether basically period so yep

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:43,059
1 1 reso side the point people towards

00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:45,340
as a talk cristóvão gave at a pike on

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:47,110
Australia a couple of years ago called

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,110
Python 3 for people who haven't been

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,580
paying attention and it's just really

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,650
good talk going through some of the

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,960
options we do expect there will be

00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:58,090
commercial vendors offering support

00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,620
beyond 2020 for the people who have

00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,920
business critical systems that haven't

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,780
been my

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,840
yet and they're just going look we just

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,070
really really need a bit more time there

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,490
will be options there

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:14,710
but yeah the 23rd deadline is we're not

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:18,160
doing this for free anymore I tend to be

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,380
the pragmatist and if I look back two to

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,470
three years we were in a very different

00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:26,530
space regarding Python 2 and python 3

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:29,500
support we've come a long way in terms

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:33,640
of the major packages that support

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,830
Python 3 Bret had a wonderful graphic

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,230
ticker and I think we've got all the top

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:42,340
what was it three hundred and something

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,950
but I think from the science standpoint

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:48,160
we've been using three for a long time

00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,230
and I recognize that there's a lot of

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,830
legacy code out there that's using

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:57,040
Python 2 and if I look back a couple of

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:59,140
years like Instagram did a great keynote

00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,720
about how they were moving things from

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,050
two to three I think one of the things

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,680
that we want like a p.m. to help us in

00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,890
this transition is to really take those

00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,870
best practices that we're learning from

00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:16,990
large companies who have found the

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:20,380
business case to transition to make it

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,990
easier and we recognize there's going to

00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:26,710
be bumps along the way but I think as a

00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:29,740
community and over time we'll get there

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,110
and I think we'll get there more by

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:36,070
pulling together than to try and

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:40,180
polarize apart in a situation like this

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,590
always a good example to go by and so

00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,180
we're kind of running out of time so I'm

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,530
going to pick one more question for the

00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,750
group and then after that we're gonna

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,370
start taking questions from the audience

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,130
what does the steering council have

00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:53,260
planned for growing and sustaining

00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,430
diversity within core development I'm

00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,490
sorry I didn't hear that

00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:02,500
corine diversity growing diversity well

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:06,970
I think we just need to first celebrate

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:10,450
the the progress that we have made 2017

00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:12,070
it wasn't that long ago mariotta was the

00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:16,480
first core dev

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:18,910
and that as a woman and we have a long

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,250
way to go still with diversity but I

00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:24,910
think what we're trying to focus in on

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:29,620
is leveraging the interest that people

00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:34,330
have to be inclusive to create processes

00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:37,690
and tooling that allows more people to

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:41,200
be able to contribute and to have the

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:44,380
learning curve towards contribution to

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,410
become less and and also to really

00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,530
strengthen the third-party library

00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:53,260
ecosystem as well because a lot of folks

00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:56,530
get their start in third-party packages

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,900
which is fantastic so for those of you

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,610
are at the sprints I hope you have a

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,350
great time if you've never been to a

00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,190
sprint you're a little tentative please

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,830
come

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,660
and thank you to the folks that attended

00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,290
and organize the mentored sprints

00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,090
yesterday

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,270
that's an excellent step in the right

00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,270
direction

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,840
so I mentioned this when Paul Everett

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:26,670
and I had our little interview but I

00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,790
look out here and I see this crowd every

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,230
one of you can become a core dev every

00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,880
single person you don't have to be a C

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,970
programmer all you have to do is care

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,119
about Python and want to learn how to

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:41,700
become a core dev and I know many of us

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
on stage and and there are many people

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,570
in the community who are mentoring

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,900
people and so you know think about

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:50,940
diversity in all the axes of diversity

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,890
like what your experience is you don't

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,280
have to be a professional programmer

00:35:52,890 --> 00:36:00,690
right you can be young old doesn't

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,750
matter like so widen your horizons think

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,040
about yourself as a core dev and then if

00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,670
that's something that you really want to

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,830
aspire to engage with mentors and learn

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,710
the process of contributing to Python

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,210
because we need everybody I mean there's

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,580
so much work to do and there's so many

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,990
interesting things to do that I think

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,350
everybody can really contribute to

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,869
Python there's no reason why thanks for

00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,460
adding that berry so next up I want to

00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,830
post this link where everyone can go and

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,810
add their questions for the steering

00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:39,210
council so it's PyCon dot us slash panel

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:40,680
and Ernest somewhere in the back is

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,070
going to pop some questions up as soon

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,070
as they come in

00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,180
it's like an either jeopardy music plan

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,770
right

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,890
[Music]

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,890
[Laughter]

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:11,270
[Laughter]

00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:15,540
all right anonymous what is your

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:20,230
favorite pet berry that's easy kept 401

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:28,570
[Laughter]

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:37,280
30 30 100 Carol probably 581 all right

00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:39,470
you know 4 8 4 4 8 4 3 4 3 3 4 3 all

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,750
right the next question is what are the

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:46,640
first steps to take to become a core dev

00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:49,250
with Python hmm look at the dev guide

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,140
yeah the guy Python no Doric probably is

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,350
a good place to start to get an idea of

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:57,650
our process how things work just kind of

00:37:54,350 --> 00:38:00,260
see the lay of the lands and just see if

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:03,050
it's something that interested yeah can

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,500
you give us that URL again dev guide de

00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:10,070
Vie GUI te dot Python org

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,680
Thanks the next one is what do you see

00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:17,660
as the biggest gap in the language right

00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,970
now I actually don't know that there are

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:25,310
big gaps in the language but I think

00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:27,230
that the C Python interpreter needs I I

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,450
guess the way I sort of talk about it

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:31,880
with people is that like the language is

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:35,990
pretty awesome right that's what we love

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,790
about it and python is kind of unique in

00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:41,540
the sense that it's great for one-off

00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:43,510
scripts and it grows as you start to get

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,360
more ambitious and as your team grows

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,760
and then you can run Instagram on Python

00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,800
right like that's a big codebase and

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,770
Python and especially with the typing

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,310
and a type annotations it can grow to

00:38:54,770 --> 00:39:01,430
large teams small teams and so on but

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:05,990
you know the interpreter in a sense is

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:08,630
28 years old and you know the state of

00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,550
the art of virtual machines has

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,100
come a long way in that end at that time

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:16,580
and I think that what I'm particularly

00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:19,550
interested in is how can we make Python

00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,260
faster you know how can we take it into

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,390
more environments where it's not in

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,620
right now those are the things that I

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:29,270
think we need to spend some focus on the

00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,040
language is pretty good there's not a

00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,330
lot missing that I that you know a lot a

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,450
lot of things that I'm missing from it

00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:37,970
so that's my take I'm similar to Barry

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,190
in the language itself I don't think

00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:42,470
it's missing a lot the thing I'm most

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:47,150
jealous of from another ecosystem is

00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:49,340
JavaScript source maps because the way

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,990
out respects currently work there's a

00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,650
vast difference between what you get

00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:56,120
with a few Python module verses as soon

00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,950
as you do any kind of transformational

00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,210
compilation on that module you very

00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:03,440
clear a curent respects and there's a

00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,940
lot of stuff around source Maps in

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,400
JavaScript world where they can do lots

00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,690
of transformations and if I clients but

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,910
their debug is and their trace back

00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,170
generators can still figure out what was

00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,690
that originally before it got

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,760
transformed and tell you like in the

00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:19,360
original source code where you need to

00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,130
go look to find the source of a fault

00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,420
and in theory we could adapt that to

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,820
Python like there's nothing

00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:29,120
intrinsically JavaScript specific about

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:33,230
it but yeah it just requires folks to

00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,940
sit down and do the design work we have

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,320
time for one more question before we

00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,960
wrap this up

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,840
anonymous posted we hear a lot about

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,150
burnout of core developers what does the

00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,670
council hat does the council have any

00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:52,310
plans to improve this is there anything

00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:58,070
that the community can do also so yeah

00:40:52,310 --> 00:41:01,160
so in terms of specific plans I think in

00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:03,680
general its to just make being a core

00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,850
dev easier in terms of time and effort

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,510
required

00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:11,870
hence some some excitement up here

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,400
obviously for pet 581 and such and just

00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,870
various ways we can just make it easier

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,420
for core devs to get their work done

00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:20,029
it turns what the community can do

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:23,130
honestly just be nice to Cortez

00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:25,589
we are on social media you can watch my

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,569
keynote from last year about this but

00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:29,519
basically we are all on social media so

00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,980
when people go online and start griping

00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,140
about a decision we made we do see that

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,470
we do read it we do feel it because we

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,019
do care a lot and so constructive

00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,460
feedback is always welcome but just flat

00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,079
out negative feedback really doesn't

00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,789
help anyone and it just adds to the

00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:50,970
negativity and just the burnout rate so

00:41:46,789 --> 00:42:02,599
honestly just be nice online and that

00:41:50,970 --> 00:42:05,460
would help immensely few more things

00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:08,579
going back to where I said pythons the

00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,880
people's programming language we are all

00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:14,369
people we have feelings we make mistakes

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,069
we do good things we try and celebrate

00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,640
people's efforts sometimes we get it

00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:21,660
wrong

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:24,420
tell us kindly and I think one of the

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:29,160
things that really pleasantly surprised

00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:32,519
me and I'm very proud of is from ghido

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,579
stepping down as B DFL to where we are

00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:38,549
now with a steering council the core

00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:42,980
team and the greater community did a

00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:47,160
fantastic job of pulling together

00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:50,339
working to the common goal of we value

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,440
the language we want it to persist so

00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:55,410
we're gonna be decent through this

00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,579
process of trying to come up with

00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:02,119
different options for the language to

00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:06,500
ultimately selecting a steering council

00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:10,500
and I think a lot of what Brett says is

00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:14,130
what you write remember there's a person

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,619
on the other side what you say there's a

00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:20,339
person on the other side if you get it

00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:25,250
wrong apologize I'm sorry goes a long

00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:29,759
way in at least making environments

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:31,859
kinder safer to work in and ultimately a

00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:35,069
lot more fun and productive

00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,930
so thank you to the core team thank you

00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:49,140
to everybody that contributes to Python

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:51,180
and uses Python and I'll just add one

00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,859
last one for this one which is we are

00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,009
actively working with the Python

00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:58,109
Software Foundation to look for ways the

00:43:56,009 --> 00:44:00,089
foundation can better support so one

00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:02,190
concrete way to help is a better

00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:04,319
resourced Python Software Foundation can

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,079
do more things to help core development

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,549
so the PSF fundraiser is currently

00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:14,700
running and that is a concrete way to

00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:16,440
help as well dot us slash PSF and find

00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,880
that fundraiser that's a great note to

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,799
end this on thank you all so much for

00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,829
joining us this morning enjoy the rest

00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:28,019
of PyCon all right why don't you stand

00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:30,829
up another round of applause for Eva and

00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:30,829
steering Council

00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:44,309
all right so last reminders job fair and

00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,440
poster session will go into 1 p.m. we'll

00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:49,170
have another 3 sessions of talks and

00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,480
then come on back here at 3:10 p.m. for

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,960
our closing plenary thanks have a

00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,960
