Playlist: PyCon 2015
Description: 
	"Speaker: Pete Fein

Four years after the Arab Spring & 2 years after Snowden, little has changed. What now? This talk will remember Telecomix, an ad-hoc activist cluster that supported free communication around the world. Stories of humans and machines, reflection on 3 years of hacktivism & exploration of similarities to the free software community. It follows a 2011 Pycon lightning talk given after Tahrir Square.

apologies for my pronunciation that is

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,809
the most French I've spoken in 20 years

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm going to be talking about free

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,510
software today and I wanted to try to

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,780
remember what that originally stood for

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,489
if I use the words open source I want

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,449
everyone to pretend the Richard Stallman

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:07,049
and immediately shout out free software

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:09,720
ok ok let's practice in 1998 with the

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:15,150
help of IBM open source software was

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,340
invented her great I was an agent with

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,200
telecom Ock's an ad hoc cluster of

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,830
internauts who defended free speech

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,470
online we had no formal members no

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,110
leaders no spokesperson we took no money

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,329
at all called tech support for the Arab

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,740
Spring we worked with people from all

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,560
over the world to facilitate

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,619
communication using free software to be

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,659
clear we only did calm support we didn't

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,720
plan protests or do anything violent or

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,390
destructive the cluster was founded in

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,490
2009 by the same folks who started the

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,490
Swedish pure opteron movement and the

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,439
Pirate Bay telecom occasions hailed from

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,409
all over the globe mostly Europe and

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,060
came from variety of backgrounds a few

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,700
season activists a member of the

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,710
European Parliament many many sis

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,590
admin's and plenty of people with no

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,630
technical skills at all we gathered on

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,229
the self-hosted IRC network and ran

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,349
wiki's ether pads VPNs and IM server and

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,710
custom-built darknets we tended to have

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,260
a

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,720
150 humans and 30 machines at a time

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,400
those several thousands of several

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,040
hundred people participated at some

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,200
point or another we operated as an

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,350
ad-hoc recei much like a free software

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,650
project if you had a good idea you found

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,020
some friends and just went to work this

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,750
effort took over my life for over two

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,780
years I didn't have a job I burned all

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,580
my savings I barely wrote code and it

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,990
remains one of the most compelling

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,110
things I've ever done i joined telecom

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,750
exert lee before the jan 25 s protests

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,480
in Egypt Tahrir Square and I work 20

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,860
hours a day for the next eight days

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,470
trying to keep the internet running in

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,780
the face of government censorship we'd

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,610
get Egyptians on our IRC who were

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,620
blocked from Twitter and we take news

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,990
reports and photos and tweet them out

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,840
using the telek comics account acting

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,400
like a human proxy that was the kind of

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,000
facilitation of communication that we

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,400
did after Mubarak shocked the world by

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,550
disconnecting Egypt from the internet we

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,890
devolved to 1980s technology running 500

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,020
dial-up modem lines and sending fax spam

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,020
with messages of support and treatments

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,750
for tear gas we didn't call up Hillary

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,260
Clinton to call Obama to call mubarak to

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,300
say please turn it back on we took

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,870
direct action and did what we could our

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,870
cells

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,100
the Egyptians thanked us the Egyptians

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,660
thanked us but I told them to just get

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,590
our backs if something went down in the

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,030
States eight months later they did I was

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,920
at a human rights conference in San

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,010
Francisco when police across the bay

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,540
violently attacked Occupy Oakland one of

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,970
the conference attendees was Egyptian

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,040
and he organized the Solidarity protest

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,040
in Tahrir in support of the occupiers

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,490
that summer I met a documentary

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,620
filmmaker who had worked in arrears

00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,480
media tent she told me about the

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,280
gardener at her family's house and their

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,980
discussion about an upcoming election

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,960
she said that she had intended to vote

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,050
for candidate X and the gardener came

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,590
back the next day and said I voted for X

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,560
because you told me to elections were

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,510
meaningless 50 years of dictatorship had

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,490
left Egyptians without the Civic habits

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:44,440
necessary for effective democracy

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,960
telecom X's next major operation was in

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,930
Syria we acted as tech support for an

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,700
entire country for almost two years we

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,890
work closely with Syrians on the ground

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,230
for months on end helping them free

00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,919
speak freely and safely online and

00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,210
leaked documents including a list of

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,780
35,000 people wanted by the secret

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,610
police this was extremely hands on you

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,270
can't just give somebody tour and tell

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:13,060
them to have a nice anonymous day at

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,460
times we hijacked most of Syria's web

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,770
traffic using the script to change dns

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,540
settings on cable and DSL modems that

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,660
still have the default vendor password

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,760
we redirected requests for facebook and

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,960
google to a page that informed Syrians

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,340
they were under surveillance and

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,320
provided tools for defense in 2013 as

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,720
the situation deteriorated towards Civil

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,070
War agents help for people and their

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,270
families get out of the country our

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,760
investigations of the Syrian nets in

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,860
2011 uncovered evidence of blue coat

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,550
hardware proxies being used to Center

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,080
the net in violation of US sanctions

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,849
after the logs were leaked I wrote a

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,410
post for slashdot and the story

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,270
eventually made it to the front pages of

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,139
the Washington Post and Wall Street

00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,669
Journal

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,759
the company finally admitted

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,469
responsibility tella comics agents then

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,740
worked in the Brussels headquarters of

00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:07,449
the European Union to ban the sale

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,389
assertion and surveillance technology to

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:13,599
Syria the first time the EU had

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,800
implemented such export controls this

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,050
story captures what tella comicsdigital

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,629
network stands to media hacking to

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,789
affecting political change there was no

00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,669
coordinated effort or deliberate in 10

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:30,159
yet somehow addis gorgon disorganized

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:34,900
group of sketchy hackers managed to

00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:37,740
change international law a few days

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,210
after the defeat of SOPA in 2012

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,159
protests began in Poland against the

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,889
imminent passage of the act of copyright

00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:47,169
treaty telecom exert as a back channel

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,319
where organizers from the pirate party's

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,330
digital rights ngos and anons could

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,259
coordinate resistance on the streets and

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,839
in the legislators the protests spread

00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:01,960
all over Europe including 300,000 people

00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,460
in Germany alone the irony was that the

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,539
back channel is actually really quiet

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:11,669
because we were all so busy this video

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:15,089
is from the protests in Warsaw Poland I

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,089
don't have any audio

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:27,210
okay there were about 15,000 people at

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,950
this event and they're hopping because

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,760
it's late January and its really

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:35,400
freaking cold one of my favorite banners

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,870
from the Polish protest red from Moscow

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,000
to Brussels we will get free speech the

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,890
polish Prime Minister then sat down with

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,110
the country's internet for a seven hour

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,350
debate taking questions from Twitter

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,440
Facebook Google+ a live audience and it

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,240
was broadcast on national TV telecom

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,550
occasions felt those platforms were to

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,310
proprietary so we hosted an IRC channel

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,200
for the discussion as well the Prime

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,940
Minister withdrew his support and issued

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,860
a statement encouraging other European

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,070
leaders to do the same and the treaty

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,020
was defeated at the last minute Poland

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,970
has since begun exploring intellectual

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,160
property reform including shorter

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,160
copyright terms and file-sharing rights

00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:25,289
in his book hackers heroes of the

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:27,599
computer revolution Steven Levy

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,089
described the hacker ethic a body of

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,189
concepts beliefs and mores that animated

00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:35,099
the early hacker culture at MIT and

00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:37,259
Stanford though written 30 years ago

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,769
this list pretty well describes both

00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:43,740
free software and activist hackers to

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:45,870
highlight a few number 3 the principle

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,230
of decentralization gives rise to both

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,290
telecom axes adhocracy and pythons bbfl

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,839
consensus model it also encourages for

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,839
King not only of source code but intelli

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,370
comics is case of the cluster itself

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:04,860
which spawn the global crypto party

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,720
movement to number four I dad gender and

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,660
point out how much progress we've made

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,519
since I first attended pycon in 2007

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,220
when it was ninety-five percent dudes

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,999
and let me tell you that sucked for the

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,740
men to intelli comics we often didn't

00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:24,480
know agents real names or where they

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:26,699
were from and we didn't care but it's

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,100
the first ideal the hands-on imperative

00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:31,379
that's so compelling to be a hacker

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,410
means to not passively accept what we're

00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:37,620
given but rather to explore and improve

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,990
as hackers were unwilling to settle for

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,519
external limitations in our software in

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,589
ourselves in our society I'd like to add

00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,600
to levy's list an ethic of mutual aid

00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:52,230
the idea that people can help each other

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,939
out on a purely voluntary basis when

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,620
working with telecom Ock's are on free

00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:58,230
software I've learned that almost

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,959
anything worth doing cannot be done

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,939
alone it takes the cooperation of a

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
community with a range of skills and

00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:09,569
commitment to make something manifest

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,370
and real biella Coleman argued in her

00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,620
first book coding freedom that the

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,959
success of free software came from a

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,480
politics circumscribed to the creation

00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,100
of technology enabling it to avoid the

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,240
trap of traditional left-right

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,850
dichotomies programmers myself included

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,670
dislike politics it's messy and stupid

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,470
and inefficient in the thousands of

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,550
people I chatted with as an activist

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,339
encountered maybe one or two

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,649
developers I don't think this is good

00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:41,970
enough anymore the Internet has become

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,470
too deeply integrated into our lives if

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,779
sufficiently advanced technology is

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,779
indistinguishable from magic then

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,720
hackers are wizards with power to shape

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,550
reshape the world it's fear of this

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,130
power that's caused governments to

00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,880
persecute us the nerd scare biela spoke

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:05,019
about yesterday when the Snowden

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,120
revelations came out in March 2013 I was

00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,190
I was so freaked out I gots known for

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,709
three days straight not because of the

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,450
content the NSA's technical capabilities

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:15,459
were already pretty well known at least

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,320
among the security crowd but rather

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,480
because if we weren't able to change

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,540
things politically surveillance would

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,510
become permanent and normal it's between

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,019
two years and aside from more disasters

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,610
like heartbleed very little has changed

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,430
throughout history a surveillance state

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,260
has never voluntarily dismantled itself

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,480
and I'd like to spend the rest of my

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:42,760
time today trying to answer the question

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,990
now what now what the restore the Fourth

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,850
Movement came out of Reddit and

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,170
organized protest against surveillance

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,350
around the United States for

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,970
Independence Day 2013 I was really

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,430
excited to see other people take up my

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,800
causes for a change I didn't have to do

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,660
anything besides show up we marched

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,660
through downtown Chicago parks filled

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,910
with visiting tourists a protester wrote

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,370
a message in chalk on the sidewalk when

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,070
a cop casually stepped on his hand and

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,079
then detained him there was only one cop

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,990
so I grabbed the guy and I like try to

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,550
do arrest him and a crowd forums and the

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,649
cops running a ticket my start harassing

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,880
him what are you citing them for you got

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,770
your little book there tell me what

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,390
you're going to write down and the cop

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,579
says oh I don't know what law is

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,930
breaking but I'm sure it's illegal like

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,520
how would you like it if someone chalk

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,920
the sidewalk outside your neighbor the

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,510
outside your house and I tell him I

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,269
don't know where you live but people in

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,800
my neighborhood do that all the time at

00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,649
this point the cop looks like an idiot

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,130
he eventually lets the guy go who scared

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,990
starts cheering for the police would

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,570
bothered me was how practiced that cop

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,410
was and it clearly wasn't the first time

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,060
he stepped on

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,459
somebody's hand like that for writing on

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,199
the sidewalk we're facing a cultural

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,240
problem that's much bigger and deeper

00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,639
than the technical or political ones

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,800
that Snowden brought to light and it's

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,190
this culture of authoritarianism that we

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,779
need to change Enrique bastos has been a

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,430
powerful voice of this conference for

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,100
many years and I had the opportunity to

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,839
visit him in Rio de Janeiro he told me

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,670
about this music called Brazilian funk

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,769
which has nothing to do with American

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,629
funk that's made in the favelas the

00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,240
incredibly poor and violent shanty towns

00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,889
it's quite popular but some of it is

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,420
outright illegal to play because it's

00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,180
anti-government and glorifies violence

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,620
and drug lords he told me that if you

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,300
were to try to send the police to stop

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,939
them from playing it they'll just shoot

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,269
you and they teach their children how to

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:36,670
make it control is the most expensive

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,610
thing in the world he says at the end of

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,350
the day you have to play the police this

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,329
notion we've had for the last 50 years

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,660
that information wants to be free is

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:50,170
wrong it's wrong information wants

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,740
nothing control is the most expensive

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,259
thing in the world that provides a hint

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,230
to a method if we want greater freedom

00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:02,199
we can make control more costly and we

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:05,550
can do that simply by being free by

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,439
practicing freedom in our daily lives

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,939
one of the organizers of occupy Boston

00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,829
told me at the end of the workday these

00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:13,029
two bankers would take off their suits

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:15,699
and come outside and joining the

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:17,500
occupation they've since left industry

00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:20,529
and one of them now works for a

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,839
financial reform nonprofit it's not

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,189
enough to ask people to walk away you

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,160
have to give them something to walk

00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:29,110
towards I believe that free software and

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,029
hacker culture can be exactly that a

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,769
future to walk towards as an activist I

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,110
was never trying to save the world or

00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:41,050
fix the system I was just trying to help

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,089
people who asked things are too big and

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,790
too broken to fix whether it's the

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:47,379
political system or SSL they're going to

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,949
collapse under under their own weight

00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:53,439
eventually rather I was playing a long

00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:56,800
game planting the seeds for what came

00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,290
next tella comics was immensely

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,610
pragmatic and deeply principled we

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,150
didn't know what we were doing half the

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,450
time

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,040
but we always knew why every situation

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,410
was different and there was no manual

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,480
not that we would have read it anyway we

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,510
relied on our talents our ethics and

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,700
each other what hackers have to offer is

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,520
not only technology but culture and

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,560
community a way of being and belonging

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,030
that can help rebuild a world that is

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,280
broken afraid and alone when we write

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,710
free software we create obligations for

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,720
ourselves to fix bugs and merge patches

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,360
and opportunities for others to

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,490
contribute a good free software project

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,290
becomes like a community garden it needs

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,380
tending and it begins to rebuild

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,090
democratic habits from the ground up

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,130
beyond technology we can apply our

00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,530
practices to other problems and thereby

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:51,370
bring hacker culture to a society in

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:54,100
desperate need of new ideas I mean who

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,960
here doesn't wish the other 362 days of

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,440
the year could be a little bit more like

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,440
Pike on

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,040
my journey towards activism really began

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,899
in 2007 when I was living far from home

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,120
while my wife did ethnographic field

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,040
research she'd come back from a long day

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,110
of interviewing autistic teenagers and

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,389
getting lost to find me freaking out

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,389
about drones or rendition or whatever

00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,490
and while she listened to my concerns

00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,930
she eventually told me it was too much

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,079
that I had to find other people to talk

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:31,949
to well I found them and we not only

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,829
talked we did something if there's one

00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,510
thing I want you to take away today it's

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:39,300
the importance of getting off the couch

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,490
I don't care what you do whether that's

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,010
Proust protesting an abortion clinic or

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,399
holding the door open for an old man but

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:51,180
do something or apathy will be the death

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,079
of us all let me make sure this point is

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:57,300
clear donating is not doing I love the

00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,829
eff they're my lawyers and a great

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,709
organization and you should give them

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:03,959
all of your money but if giving money is

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,959
all you do you're as much a part of the

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,520
problem as the lobbyists and politicians

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,929
it doesn't absolve you from the

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,030
responsibility of acting directly at

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,770
this point some of you probably think

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,049
this is all a bunch of cypher hippie

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,000
 but I've heard at this very

00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:24,209
conference how hacker culture can be

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
transformative in a city separated by

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,040
language and history the Montreal Python

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,860
user group is one of very few spaces

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,720
where French and English speakers gather

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,720
together and find common cause

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,030
the final story I'd like to tell is from

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:49,190
a few days ago I overheard a barista in

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,830
my hometown talking about her upcoming

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,280
trip to Montreal and where she planned

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,260
to learn how to code whether or not she

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,750
comes back from Pike on understanding

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,500
how to make a web page she will go home

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,650
changed from having spent time here

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,630
spent time with us and that gives me

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,630
hope thank you

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,130
so I could have stood up here and thank

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,410
you I could have stood up here and told

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,870
you stories for probably three hours but

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,190
I kind of just wanted to let things be

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,350
driven a little bit by what people were

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,610
interested in so if there's there's time

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,930
I'd love to take yeah absolutely we've

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,670
got lots of time for questions so it's

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,590
now a 31 part we have about eight minute

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,510
for questions so please step up there's

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,010
some microphones in the middle and I

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,180
just I want to say please everyone give

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,860
Pete a huge hand again this is

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,930
inspirational stuff so thanks a lot I

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:58,300
mean I have hundreds of questions if you

00:18:49,930 --> 00:19:02,100
guys don't go right ahead thanks for the

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:05,530
talk it was great and I wanted to know

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,929
well I've been hanging with activists

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,700
lately especially in Montreal as you

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:14,860
know there's a lot of protest going on

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:18,390
and I've heard a lot of activists say

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,530
it's useless to protest anymore and

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:24,970
personally I don't believe that's true

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:28,120
but I don't know what to tell them yeah

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:32,380
what are you talking yeah I don't know I

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:36,120
don't know you know like like I you know

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:41,290
when I when I helped organize protests

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,480
you know in some ways the whatever the

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,130
particular issue was was secondary for

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,570
me you know that we'd go out in the

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,980
streets and we were against whatever we

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,390
were against whether that was act or

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:55,450
sofa or LA Law 78 here and those things

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,970
are important but in a lot of ways just

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,880
I like seeing people in the streets like

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,460
I like seeing people out there getting

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,400
politically involved in getting

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,200
politically active and I think that that

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,360
is almost more important long-term than

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,400
whatever the particular the cause is

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,650
it's just going out and actually doing

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,350
something actually getting people

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,520
involved in trying to you know make

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,620
their society in the world a little

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,470
better you know whether you win or lose

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,820
on a particular issue like every every

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,580
time we do one of these things we get a

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:33,700
few more people to help all right thank

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:34,720
you hi what do you think we should do

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,620
about the perception

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,780
that free software supporters are just

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,900
extremists or radical lists or we just

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:47,049
have beards like Richard Stallman um wow

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,490
we're still dealing with that gosh well

00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:53,559
people stopped listening when they think

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,730
you're radical um huh uh huh I mean

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,580
personally that doesn't really bother me

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,860
um you know like I got called all sorts

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,559
of names sort of as an activist

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,640
including a terrorist sympathizer that

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,520
was like when I stopped reading the

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,890
comments um you know I I just I just

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,740
don't know I like I think sort of given

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,090
the success you know I mean I hate to

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,150
say it but like even the success of free

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,620
software in the corporate world you know

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,909
like that kind of can become a bit of a

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,380
counter-argument right mean this was the

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,059
the thing that Microsoft pushed in the

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,760
90s right that all free software

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:26,860
developers were communists and just

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,150
clearly not uh yeah i mean i don't know

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,190
i just go tellin that you know hey like

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,740
facebook runs on runs on open source

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,909
google runs and open sores freeze off

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:42,760
ooh thank you thank you free software

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:45,940
yeah yeah okay wow fantastic talk thank

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,520
you I'm wondering what you guys do guys

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,710
and gals in the offseason when there

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,809
isn't an ongoing a particular revolution

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,330
you're supporting yeah um you know so

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,100
actually the the big we kind of fell

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,570
into this by accident it the telecoms

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:05,289
was started our actually around local

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:07,539
Swedish wiretap laws you know in the the

00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:10,809
two and a half years there wasn't an

00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:13,390
offseason so it's still going huh it's

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:17,409
still going in so yeah actually kind of

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:21,370
not so much it seems in late 2012 our

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:24,940
main IRC network got deed asked for four

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,760
or five months at like 10 gigabits per

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,090
second for like five months like we have

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,470
no I mean I don't know who did that you

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,470
know really when you're talking about

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:38,919
that much traffic you're really until a

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:43,000
nation state level actor and that really

00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,230
I think heard our ability to coordinate

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,899
and get things done because there's

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,550
we're not willing to use you know stuff

00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,560
that we don't run ourselves and

00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,730
think beyond that you know particularly

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,120
after the snow and stuff came out people

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:58,720
have kind of gone off and done other

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,750
things you know other NGOs or kind of

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,150
other activists stuff a lot of people

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,320
there's a guy here in Montreal who now

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,320
works for the Tor project people are

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,470
running software I don't know it's

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,450
always it's always somethin flowed yeah

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,730
I had a personal level I got really

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,560
burned out I got really really burned

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,780
out and I'm in a lot of ways just now

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,270
kind of getting back to figuring out

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,490
what what to do my life but I don't know

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,740
I don't know it's spring it's time for

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,740
for some new stuff okay thanks yeah

00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:35,260
firstly thank you for the talk oh so as

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,730
a technologist myself in someone who's

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,410
interested in these sorts of things I

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,150
find it difficult to talk to people who

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,680
are not so technical about these

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,210
particular issues and I was wondering if

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,860
you had any suggestions for how I could

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,510
go about getting those types of people

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,430
involved yeah I mean so so like I said

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,500
like a lot of the tell comics folks were

00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,300
not technical at all and there's there's

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,740
really stuff to be done even as an

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,790
Internet activist that doesn't require

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,770
great great deal of a technical

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,450
knowledge you know there's translations

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,520
to be written there's propaganda to

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,470
write there's art to make there's like

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,600
and just even just providing moral

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:15,520
support sometimes is worthwhile you know

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,530
for four people more broadly who just

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
kind of just look at these issues at all

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:26,260
and go okay hey so the NSA is reading

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:28,630
all my email like why do I care you know

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,460
I know I just I almost don't know what

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,010
to say that I don't know what to say

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,470
that like like I'm gonna just you know

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,090
ask them for their phone it's like okay

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,710
like it's okay that the NSA read your

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:43,570
email but I don't I don't know I just

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,220
you know I used I used to say that let

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,850
you know free speech in a lot of ways is

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,380
like the fundamental right right that

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,990
this is really the foundation of what

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,120
effective self-governance requires that

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,210
like if we can't get together and talk

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,549
about what we want collectively like it

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:05,570
becomes you know impossible to actually

00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:08,600
do anything so maybe that's that's an

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,149
angle as well I will say though that I

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,159
don't think you have to let surveillance

00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:17,929
keep you from acting you know I had

00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,499
working as an activist I help run some

00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:23,720
of the pretty giant Twitter accounts and

00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:26,059
you know we we sort of assumed that the

00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,179
NSA was listening in on our stuff I mean

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:30,470
I despite being very public and very

00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,239
clear that I was involved in anything

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,690
illegal I still wound up having chats

00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:38,149
with a federal informant you know just

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,529
at some level like you know like with

00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:41,779
the act of protest I think we're able to

00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:43,340
pull that off in part because it's hard

00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:46,190
to spy on stuff you don't understand

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,980
like this kind of like networked

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,929
organizing it looks really weird it

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,389
looks really weird if you're used to

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:54,919
thinking about surveillance is being you

00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:57,019
know on foreign government leaders or

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,690
trying to break up you know drug cartels

00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:01,999
or you know the Mafia like when you're

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,340
faced with the you know a non

00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:05,389
hierarchical organization like I think I

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,419
think the government's just kind of go

00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:10,759
oh what's what's going on here so yeah

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:16,519
don't don't let don't let that fear stop

00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:18,649
you Hey so it sounds good on paper right

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,230
you don't care about gender creed or all

00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:22,700
that stuff is it working are you getting

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,340
those people and if not how could it

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,070
work better um getting which people

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,289
sorry well women people from a lower

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,059
socioeconomic background she in

00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,649
technical roles like I know they're on

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,269
the periphery and I know certainly they

00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:38,210
were in occupy but are they actually

00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:41,359
helping you hack stuff yeah yeah

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,950
absolutely absolutely um we had a whole

00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:48,200
whole range of different people

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:51,109
participating I do want to say there was

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,509
a talk yesterday about kind of the the

00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,340
problems of no process and sort of this

00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,629
kind of classic classic problem from

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,609
feminist theory called the tyranny of

00:26:56,629 --> 00:27:00,980
structural ousness right the idea that

00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,299
sort of yeah when you don't have

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,100
structure that sort of people who are

00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:06,980
quieter kind of get don't have an

00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,749
opportunity to speak um this was sound a

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,259
little weird but sort of in telecom

00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:14,029
Ock's that's that structure lessness

00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:15,820
served as a barrier to entry and that

00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:18,740
was deliberate

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,170
we purposely wanted to kind of keep

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,290
things to a manageable size you know

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,570
during the Egypt revolution the cluster

00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,960
swelled up to almost 500 people and it

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,360
nearly broke us you know one of my my

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,400
friends from anonymous said that you

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,590
know we try to make a decision in a

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,950
channel with 300 people and it just

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,090
didn't work right and so you

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,440
know we'd have people show up at Ella

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,210
comics may be like hey this is great i

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,880
want to help tell me what to do and we'd

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,800
be just like mmm i just hang out like

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,040
for a couple days you'll find something

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:55,460
whatever and the idea there was that one

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,170
we just kind of as a basic political

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,180
idea like just didn't want to give

00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,530
people marching orders but it also was a

00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,480
way of selecting for the people who

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:06,710
would be able to work with us and kind

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,480
of be self self directed I don't know um

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,980
you know and that's certainly meant that

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,350
some people had to go off and find and

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,210
do other things but you know there's

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,160
there's a lot of stuff stuff to be done

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,590
I think it's I think it's in a different

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,210
case you know compared to something like

00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:26,710
a tech conference where there is no

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:28,940
upper bound but yeah it it definitely

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,500
definitely was was a problem for some

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,400
people who just you know showed up and

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,020
then we didn't tell them what to do when

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,810
they left and that that wound up being

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,920
okay okay guys that's going to have to

00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,570
be the last question and a brilliant

00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,860
answer and answers all the way through

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,880
and a bran tastic talk so I'm sure

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,710
you'll all join me in Thank You Pete

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,710

00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,770

00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,640
