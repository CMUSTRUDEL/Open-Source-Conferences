	"Speaker: Allison Kaptur

Have you ever wondered how the CPython interpreter works? Do you know where to find a 1,500 line switch statement in CPython? I'll talk about the structure of the interpreter that we all use every day by explaining how Ned Batchelder and I chased down a mysterious bug in Byterun, a Python interpreter written in Python. We'll also see visualizations of the VM as it executes your code.
