Have you heard about internationalization (i18n) and wondered what it meant? Perhaps your project already has i18n of its strings but you have a nagging feeling you could be doing it better. This talk will walk through the basics of i18nâ€™ing a Django project (but the principles apply to any project!), and how to make the process of localization (l10n) go more smoothly.
