Title: Sarah Bird - Interactive data for the web - Bokeh for web developers - PyCon 2015
Publication date: 2015-04-12
Playlist: PyCon 2015
Description: 
	"Speaker: Sarah Bird

Interactive data visualization libraries are mostly a JavaScript stronghold. The new Python library, Bokeh, provides a simple, clean way to make more shiny things. Although it comes from the data science community, it has a lot to offer web developers. For a visualization you might have built in d3.js, I'll show how to build it in Bokeh, how to test it, and how to hook it into your web app.

WE HAVE THREE EXCELLENT TALKS. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU STUCK

00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,320
AROUND. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS SARAH BIRD

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,340
WHO WILL TELL US ONCE AND FOR ALL WHETHER IT'S BO-KA OR

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,320
BO-KAY. [ Applause ]

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:35,590
>> HI, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS SARAH BIRD.

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,920
I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED APTIVATE.

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,480
AND TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT INTERACTIVE DATA FOR THE

00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,130
WEB IN PYTHON USING THE DATA VISUALIZATION LIBRARY BOKEH.

00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,070
I JUST PRONOUNCE IT WITH MY BRITISH ACCENT AND PEOPLE SAY IT

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,510
SOUNDS CHARMING. AND SO I'M THE KIND OF PERSON

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,910
THAT LIKES TO LEARN THINGS BY DOING, SLASH, BREAKING THEM, SO

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,480
WE'RE GONNA GET A FEEL FOR THE CAPABILITIES.

00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,820
IT'S A DATA VISUALIZATION LIBRARY.

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,070
THERE ARE MANY DATA VISUALIZATION LIBRARIES ALREADY.

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,360
IT'S TYPICALLY A STRONG HOLD OF JAVASCRIPT WORLD, BUT IN THE

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,880
PYTHON WORLD WE HAVE THINGS LIKE MAP PLOT LIB AND OTHER THINGS

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,360
LIKE THAT. BUT BOKEH IS DIFFERENT.

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,880
BOKEH IS IN PYTHON. IT MAKES YOUR VISUALIZATIONS FOR

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,780
THE WEB AS WEBBY OBJECTS THAT ARE INTERACTIVE AND DYNAMIC AND

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,790
REALLY DATA DRIVEN AND ITS ROOTS AND ITS HISTORY IS IN DATA

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,920
SCIENCE AND SO HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE WOULD SORT OF PULL

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,640
THEMSELVES IN THE DATA SCIENTIST CAMP?

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,909
SO A FEW PEOPLE HERE, PANDA, AND NOTEBOOK, THEY'RE GONNA BE

00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,509
NODDING. HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THE WEB

00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,980
DEVELOPER SIDE OF THINGS? RIGHT.

00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,450
SO THESE THINGS MEAN NOTHING TO US.

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,840
BUT THAT'S A BIT OF A FOREIGN WORLD, BUT I THINK BOKEH IS A

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,159
REALLY POWERFUL TOOL FOR ME AS A DJANGO DEVELOPER.

00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,670
AND SO WHENEVER I CAN, I LIKE TO STAY IN PYTHON.

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,840
THAT IS MY FIRST REASON FOR LOVING BOKEH IS I REALLY LIKE

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,130
WRITING IN PYTHON, AND I THINK THIS IS A CROWD THAT PROBABLY

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,489
ALSO LIKING WRITING IN PYTHON. YOU GET TO STAY JUST IN THAT

00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,260
WORLD, BUT YOU'RE STILL MAKING A DIFFERENT END INTERACTIVE

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,150
VISUALIZATIONS. THERE ARE OTHER REASONS TO USE

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,569
BOKEH TOO. THE FIRST ONE IS IF ANY OF YOU

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:44,260
HAVE EVER USED SOMETHING LIKE D3.JS, THERE IS A LIMIT TO HOW

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,590
MANY NUMBER -- HOW MANY NUMBER OF ELEMENTS YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,660
THROUGH AT THE DOME BEFORE YOUR BROWSER EXPLODES.

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,060
BOKEH USES CANVAS TO RENDER YOUR VISUALIZATIONS, AND IT'S NOT

00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,910
GONNA COMPLAIN. THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOME

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,959
WEB G.L. BACK IN 2 WHICH IS GONNA MAKE THAT EVEN BETTER.

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,489
AND WITH BOKEH CONNECTED TO THE SERVER SIDE, YOU CAN REALLY DO

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,099
SOME AWESOME THINGS WITH BIG DATA, WHICH THERE'S LOTS OF

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,569
INFORMATION ABOUT ONLINE, I'M NOT GONNA TALK SO MUCH ABOUT

00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,319
TODAY BUT I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT LATER.

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
BOKEH LET'S YOU DO REAL-TIME UPDATES.

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,180
WHEN YOU CONNECT YOUR DATA VISUALIZATION TO THE BOKEH

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,800
SERVER, ANY TIME YOUR DATA CHANGES, THAT DATA'S GONNA BE

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:33,489
PUSHED STRAIGHT DOWN YOUR PLOT. THE FOURTH THING THAT MAKES

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,850
BOKEH AWESOME IS YOU'RE TRYING TO INTERACT WITH YOUR PLOT BUT

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,580
MAYBE DOING SOME COMPUTATION THAT YOUR BROWSER'S GONNA REALLY

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:49,220
COMPLAIN ABOUT, THROW IT BACK DOWN AND IT'S GONNA WORK REALLY

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,740
NICELY FOR YOU. SO BOKEH IS NOT THE MAGIC SILVER

00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,099
BULLET. THERE NEVER IS ONE IN WEB.

00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,680
BUT IT IS MY NEW DEFAULT. IT'S MY NEW GO-TO TOOL TO WRITE

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,421
SOMETHING, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON IF YOU

00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:08,870
REALLY HAVE A SPECIALIZED NEED. BUT BOKEH COVERED AN AWFUL LOT.

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,140
VERY QUICKLY, HOW DOES IT WORK, BECAUSE WE'RE WRITING PYTHON,

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,620
BUT MAGICALLY JAVASCRIPT COMES OUT.

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,709
YOU WRITE PYTHON ON THE SERVER SIDE.

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,660
AND IT MAKES A JSON AND THAT GETS SHOVED DOWN TO YOUR CLIENT.

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,949
AND THERE IS ACTUALLY A LIBRARY, SO THE BOKEH CORE DEV TEAM

00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:34,729
ACTUALLY HAVE TO WRITE A LOT OF JAVASCRIPT FOR US, AND THAT

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,409
TELLS THE PYTHON TO TURN -- IN HTML.

00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:43,919
AND WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THIS IS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,629
LIVE IN A WORLD OTHER THAN PYTHON SOMETIMES, THERE ARE

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,150
OTHER LANGUAGES, OTHER LIBRARIES THAT CAN ALSO CREATE THAT --

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,159
CREATE THAT JSON. SO THERE'S R-BOKEH AND BOKEH

00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,999
SCHOLAR AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT I'VE NEVER USED.

00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,550
DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THEM, BUT THEY EXIST AND SOME PEOPLE THINK

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,440
THEY'RE REALLY AWESOME. ALSO, THERE'S A COMPATIBILITY

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,059
LAYER, THE FAR RIGHT THERE, SO IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A WHOLE

00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:09,210
BUNCH OF PLOTS IN MAP PLOT LIB OR C BORN OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,809
THAT, THERE'S ALREADY A COMPATIBILITY LAYER IN THERE, SO

00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:19,400
THEY'LL COME OUT AS WEB VISUALIZATIONS FOR YOU USING

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,439
BOKEH. BUT TODAY WE'RE GONNA REALLY BE

00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,970
FOCUSING ON THE CORE BOKEH LIBRARY.

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,020
AND BOKEH ITSELF IS CERTAINLY WHEN I CAME TO IT ABOUT A YEAR

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,839
AGO, THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN USE IT, SO I'M

00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,680
GONNA FOCUS ON TWO SORT OF ASPECTS.

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,361
AND FOR ME THAT WAS -- THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET A LOT DONE, AND I

00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:45,969
THINK IT SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY BOKEH'S PRETTY ACCESSIBLE.

00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,009
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING TODAY IS WE'RE GONNA BE BUILDING

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,520
THE VISUALIZATION THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE.

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,039
I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED APTIVATE.

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:58,509
WE'RE A NONPROFIT, AND WE BUILD SOFTWARE FOR OTHER NONPROFITS.

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,789
ABOUT A YEAR AGO WE BUILT THIS VISUALIZATION FOR WATER AID,

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,180
WHICH IS -- AND IT'S A MAP OF WATER AND SANITATION IN AFRICA

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,999
AND HOW IT'S CHANGING OVER TIME. IT'S BUILT IN D3.

00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,349
AND THAT WAS A GOOD CHOICE AND I THINK I WILL STILL BUILD IT IN

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,719
D3 IF I WAS DOING IT AGAIN TODAY, BUT YOU CAN GO TO THE

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:21,089
GITHUB PAGE AND SEE THE ORIGINAL CODE AS WELL AS GOING TO THE

00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,939
CODE FOR THIS TALK TO SEE THE BOKEH CODE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,020
I MAY USE THE ACRONYM W.A.S.H. A LOT TODAY.

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,619
AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE TERMS THAT WE USE IN THE WATER AND

00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,399
SANITATION WORLD. SO HERE'S THE VISUALIZATION.

00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,990
AND IT HAS A SLIDER. AND IF I CLICK ON THE SANITATION

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,439
SIDE OF THINGS, YOU CAN SEE THE COLORS CHANGE OVER TIME.

00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,069
AND WE CAN HOVER OVER COUNTRIES AND WE CAN PICK COUNTRIES.

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,899
AND SO WE'RE GONNA REMAKE -- OOPS, WE'RE GONNA REMAKE THIS

00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,219
TODAY. D3 ONE ON THE LEFT AND THE BOKEH

00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,149
ONE THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE TODAY IS ON THE RIGHT.

00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:00,129
AND THERE AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN LATE, THERE'S THE

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,150
LINK FOR THE CODE TO THIS TALK AND THE SLIDES FOR THIS TALK,

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,949
AND I'LL TWEET ABOUT IT LATER AS WELL.

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,050
SO WE'LL START WITH THE CHARTS INTERFACE.

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,409
WHICH IS KIND OF AMAZING. AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:21,270
FUNCTIONS BUILT INTO BOKEH. AND SO YOU IMPORT THE LINE.

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,209
WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE LINE CHART THAT WAS ON THE

00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,029
VISUALIZATION. AND IMPORT THE LINE FUNCTION

00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,740
FROM BOKEH.CHARTS. YOU SHOVE IN YOUR DATA.

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,789
YOU USE THE SHOW METHOD. AND THIS APPEARS.

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,599
AND THIS A FULLY WEB-IFIED VISUALIZATION.

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,219
WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS. WE HAVE A PAN TOOL THAT SORT OF

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:47,800
WORKING OUT THE BOX. WE HAVE A ZOOM.

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,889
WE HAVE A RESIZE FUNCTION HERE. SHOULD WE WANT TO DO THAT.

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,999
ZOOM. SAVE IT.

00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,959
RESET. AND MOVE ON.

00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,680
SO THAT'S PRETTY RAD. AND THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,779
THESE ALREADY BUILT IN. YOU'VE GOT YOUR AREA CHARTS, BAR

00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:05,449
PLOTS AND HEAT MAPS AND SO ON. SO YOU CAN USE THESE STRAIGHT

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,059
AWAY. SO HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN ROOM

00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:14,669
WHO ALREADY SELF-IDENTIFIED AS UNDERSTANDING PANDAS, YOU CAN

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,719
THROW THAT INTO ALL THE CHART FUNCTIONS AND INTO BOKEH, AND

00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:22,419
IT'S GONNA DO WHAT YOU WANT. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,669
USED PANDAS BEFORE, IT'S ONE OF THESE AWESOME TOOLS BUT IT HAS A

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,209
FAIRLY STEEP LEARNING CURVE, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT

00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,250
TOO MUCH TO REALLY GET GOING WITH BOKEH.

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,750
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU HAVE -- WHAT YOU NEED TO

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,071
KNOW IS BASICALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S JUST BASICALLY

00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:42,760
DATA THAT LOOKS LIKE A TABLE. AND SO IF YOU HAVE A CSV, YOU

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:52,260
CAN USE THE READ CSV METHOD. IF LIKE ME YOU ARE MORE LIKELY

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,940
TO HAVE A DJANGO QUERY SET, THEN -- AND THIS TOPIC LINE HERE

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,360
LOOKS SUPER FAMILIAR TO YOU, THEN IN ORDER TO GET THAT INTO A

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,779
DATA FRAME, YOU TURN THAT INTO A VALUES QUERY SET, AND THEN YOU

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,819
CAN USE THE FROM RECORDS METHOD. WHICH WILL THEN TURN YOU -- YOUR

00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,910
DJANGO QUERY SET INTO A PANDAS DATA FRAME AND YOU'RE GOOD TO

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,540
GO. AND YOU CAN DO IT FROM RAW SQL.

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,940
THAT ALL WORKS TOO. AND THERE'S LOTS MORE

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,269
INFORMATION AT PANDAS.PYDATA.ORG.

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,430
AND SO HERE YOU ARE. YOU'RE LIKE YES, I'M GONNA MAKE

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,000
A DATA VISION. YES, I USED MY CHART FUNCTION.

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,850
YOU WALK PAST YOUR DESIGNER, AND YOUR DESIGNER IS LIKE, THIS DOES

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,720
NOT LOOK LIKE OUR WEBSITE. AND SHE HAS SAD FACE.

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,040
AND SO IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD A LITTLE BIT,

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,329
AND YOU SHEEPISHLY WALK AWAY. AND SO WE HAVE TWO WAYS TO MAKE

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,649
IT SHINY. THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS ACTUALLY

00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:58,470
ONE I USE A LOT, I CALL IT THE REDUCTIVE APPROACH.

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,269
WE TAKE THAT CHART FUNCTION, THE LINE FUNCTION, AND WE PASS IN

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,120
SOME ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS TO IT TO START TO CLEAN IT UP.

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,140
WE GIVE IT THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH WE WANT.

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,930
TAKE AWAY SOME OF THOSE GRID LINES.

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,250
WE'VE TAKEN AWAY ALL THE TOOLS BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,220
THEM AND WE ARE MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,839
BOKEH ACTUALLY COMES WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF BUILT-IN

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,400
PALLETTES WHICH IS REALLY HANDY FOR MAKING THINGS LOOK NICE OUT

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,149
OF THE BOX. SO THAT GETS US KIND OF FAR, BUT

00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,620
REMEMBER WE'RE WORKING IN PYTHON, AND SO WE HAVE A WHOLE

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,610
BUNCH OF PYTHON OBJECTS. SO WE CAN START SETTING

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,170
ATTRIBUTES ON THOSE OBJECTS. SO WE JUST SPECIFY AN X RANGE

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:49,410
AND A Y RANGE AND JUST START SELLING THINGS OVER AND OVER

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,740
AGAIN. AND WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,540
TWEAKING, WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO THIS.

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,970
AND AT THAT POINT I WILL MENTION THAT WHEN I'M DOING THIS KIND OF

00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,430
TWEAKING, I DO REALLY LOVE TO WORK IN THE IPYTHON NOTEBOOK.

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,120
IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED IT, IT'S REALLY GREAT FOR PROTOTYPING

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,660
VISUALIZATIONS IN BOKEH. BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE AUTO

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,029
COMPLETE. IT'S REALLY EASY TO JUST SEE

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,839
WHAT THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIDDLE WITH.

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,300
SO I REALLY LOVE IT FOR PROTOTYPING, AND IT WORKS NICELY

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:26,019
WITH PYTHON NOTEBOOK. BUT WE CAN USE IT FOR DESIGN

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,230
WORK TOO. SO THAT WAS NICE.

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,890
BUT WHERE WE'RE GOING IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO BUILD THIS

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,660
VISUALIZATION WHICH HAS A LOT OF COMPONENTS TO IT.

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,379
AND SO TO DO THIS, WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY START AGAIN AND WE'RE

00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,889
GONNA START USING THAT LOW LEVEL INTERFACE AND BUILDING THINGS UP

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,199
ONE A TIME. I ALREADY SAID.

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,709
THE LOW LEVEL INTERFACE. SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH A PLOT

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,680
OBJECT. IF YOU -- WHEN YOU CREATE A PLOT

00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,440
OBJECT, ALL YOU GET IS JUST AN EMPTY SPACE, AND IT'S NOW YOUR

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,630
RESPONSIBILITY TO START ADDING THINGS TO, AND THERE'S ONLY

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,040
REALLY THREE WAYS TO DO THAT. YOU USE THE ADD GLYPH, THE ADD

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,769
LAYOUT, OR THE ADD TOOLS METHOD. A QUICK INTERLUDE ON EMBEDDING

00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,029
BECAUSE I'M SAYING ALL THIS, BUT HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY GET INTO

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,089
YOUR WEB PAGE? BOKEH HAS A COUPLE OF BUILT-IN

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:21,100
METHODS FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN. THIS COMPONENTS METHOD HERE WILL

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,899
KICK OUT A SCRIPT AND A DIV AND YOU CAN SHOVE THAT INTO YOUR

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,589
TEMPLATE. I ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO SLIGHTLY

00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:33,670
MORE COMPLEX THINGS. I LIKE TO LOAD MY BOKEH JS

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:39,269
ASYNCHRONOUSLY. AND YOU -- AND SO YOU CAN --

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,589
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO ROLL THIS YOURSELF BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,879
MAKE THOSE SCRIPT AND DIV AND IN THE FIRST ARE JUST GINGER

00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,050
TEMPLATES, AND SO YOU CAN GO AND JUST COPY AND PASTE THEM FROM

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,339
THE BOKEH GITHUB REPO, AND THEN TWEAK THEM TO YOUR OWN NEEDS.

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,029
AND IF YOU LOOK FOR THE CODE IN THIS TALK, YOU'LL SEE ME DOING

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,149
THAT, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,540
AND I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE CSS A LITTLE BIT LATER.

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,970
SO FIRST WE'RE GONNA START SIMPLE, AND WE'RE GONNA -- THERE

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,329
WAS THE LEGEND ON THE VISUALIZATION.

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,120
AND THIS ISN'T ATTACHED TO ANY DATA.

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,570
IT'S JUST ADDING SOME BLOBS ONTO YOUR PAGE.

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,320
AND SO AT THE CORE OF BOKEH IS THIS IDEA OF GLYPHS.

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,290
AND GLYPHS ARE JUST SHAPES. I'VE FORGOTTEN WHY THEY LIKE TO

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,699
CALL THEM GLYPHS, BUT BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST SHAPES.

00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:33,259
AND SO YOU HAVE YOUR PLOT, AND YOU JUST START ADDING GLYPHS.

00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:43,199
AND 100 IS A GLYPH, AND WE JUST ADD THE 100%.

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,350
BECAUSE WE ARE USING CANVAS AND NOT SVG, WE NEED TO ACTUALLY

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,759
STYLE ALL OF OUR ELEMENTS. WE PASS IN THE FONT, THE FONT

00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,389
SIZE, JUST AS ARGUMENTS, INTO THE -- WHEN WE INSTANTIATE THAT

00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,180
CLASS. SO WE START ADDING OUR GLYPHS.

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,889
AND WE CAN USE A FOUR LOOP TO MAKE THIS NICE LAID OUT

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,589
RECTANGLE. AND IT'S VERY PYTHONIC AND IT

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,439
WORKS. SO THE NEXT THING WE NEED TO DO

00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:14,089
IS START MAKING OUR MAP. OUR MAP ACTUALLY HAS SOME DATA

00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,860
BEHIND IT. EACH COUNTRY HAS A DIFFERENT

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,459
VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND SO WE NEED TO START PAIRING GLYPHS

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:24,279
WITH ACTUAL DATA. AND SO THIS IS KIND OF TRICKY.

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,130
SO JUST BEAR WITH ME. I'M KIDDING.

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,970
IT'S NOT TRICKY AT ALL. IT'S REALLY, REALLY EASY.

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:36,860
AND SO THE -- SO IT REALLY IS -- IT'S DEVASTATINGLY SIMPLE, AND

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,100
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUST MAKES ME HAPPY ABOUT BOKEH EVERY

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,190
DAY. EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT PANDAS

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,230
DATA FRAMES, WHEN YOU GET INTO THE REALLY LOW LEVEL OF BOKEH,

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,029
THEY HAVE A DATA STRUCTURE CALLED A COLUMN DATA SOURCE.

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,009
YOU JUST PASS IT YOUR PANDAS DATE FRAME.

00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,439
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT. SO WE MAKE YOUR COLUMN DATA

00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,850
SOURCE. AND THEN WHERE BEFORE WE HAD

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,130
JUST USED ADD GLYPH WITH JUST THE GLYPH, NOW WE PASS IT THE

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:08,129
SOURCE AS WELL, AND IT'S GONNA MAGICALLY JOIN THINGS TOGETHER.

00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,379
AND SO HERE WE ARE. WE USED -- WE USED A GLYPH TO

00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,180
MAKE EACH OF THE COUNTRIES. AND SO WE PASSED IT SOME XS, WE

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,009
PASSED IT SOME YS, AND WE PASSED IT A COLOR, AND THAT CAME OUT.

00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:26,139
AND WE'VE SORT OF MELDED TOGETHER OUR KEY AND OUR MAP

00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:31,189
RIGHT HERE. SO THE NEXT THING, WE'RE GONNA

00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:33,600
ADD THE TAP TOOL AND THE HOVER TOOL.

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
THE TAP TOOL IS THE THING THAT LETS YOU SELECT THINGS.

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,540
AND THE HOVER TOOL LETS YOU HOVER.

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,990
SO THE TAP TOOL IS REALLY EASY TO ADD.

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,300
YOU JUST INSTANTIATE TAP TOOL IN ADD TOOLS TOOL.

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,389
FOR THE HOVER TOOL, YOU PASS IN A STRING, AND YOU USE THIS

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:56,939
LITTLE -- YOU USE AN AT SIGN TO SPECIFY THE COLUMN NAME THAT

00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,319
YOU'D LIKE TO BE DISPLAYING. AND SO YOU CAN JUST DO THIS VERY

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,420
SIMPLY AS I'VE SHOWN HERE, OR YOU CAN WRITE FULL HTML IF YOU

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,149
WANT TO STYLE IT. JUST USING THOSE AT SIGNS TO

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,899
DRIVE THE DATA. AND SO WHEN WE DO THAT, WE HAVE

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:20,459
THIS AGAIN, BUT NOW WHEN WE HOVER OVER, I'VE ADDED SOME CSS

00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,180
TO MEET UP WITH THAT HOVER, THOSE HOVER CLASSES, AND WHEN I

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,850
CLICK, WHEN I CLICK MY THINGS, THEY'RE NOW RESPONDING TO THE

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,560
TAP. SO YOU'RE REALLY SEEING HOW YOU

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,050
WROTE SOME PYTHON AND GOT OUT SOME WONDERFUL HTML INTERACTION.

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,699
OOPS. UH-OH.

00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:49,249
OKAY. SO... THIS IS WHEN THINGS START

00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:53,959
TO GET EVEN MORE AWESOME. EVERYTHING WE'RE WORKING WITH A

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,380
PYTHON OBJECT. SO WE CAN START SHARING PYTHON

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,180
OBJECTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,871
AND SO YOU MAY REMEMBER ON THE ORIGINAL VISUALIZATION, THERE

00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,319
WAS SOME STUFF ON THE RIGHT THAT WAS RESPONDING TO WHEN WE

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,530
CLICKED ON MAP. AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,510
OUR SOURCE THAT WE'VE ALREADY CREATED, AND WE CAN NOT ONLY

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,529
HAVE THAT ONE SOURCE DRIVE THE MAP PLOT, BUT WE CAN ALSO HAVE

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:23,900
IT DRIVE THE TEXT PLOT. AND SO WHEN WE DO THAT, HERE'S

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,280
SOME NEW SORT OF EMPTY TEXT THAT I'VE ADDED, AND THERE'S SOME

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,809
SORT OF HOLES HERE, BUT NOW WHEN I CLICK A BOX, THAT SAME ROW OF

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:37,460
DATA IS PAIRING BOTH THE -- BOTH THE MAP AND THAT TEXT BOX AT THE

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,850
TOP, AND THESE TWO ARE JUST LINKED TOGETHER BY VIRTUE OF

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:49,400
THEIR SHARING THE SAME OBJECT. SO THE -- THE NEXT PIECE IS JUST

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,650
TO GET THAT WATER AND SANITATION PIECE GOING.

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,429
SO WE -- WE HAVE OUR WATER, TEXT BOX.

00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,520
WE HAVE OUR WATER MAP. WE NOW GO AND REPEAT THE SAME

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,980
THING TO MAKE THE SANITATION VERSION OF IT, AND WE USE THE

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,230
WIDGETS THAT BOKEH PROVIDES TO STITCH IT ALL TOGETHER INTO

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,529
TABS. AND THIS IS WHERE -- WHEN YOU

00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,880
DIG IN A LITTLE BIT, YOU SEE THAT A LOT OF TIME, WHEN YOU'RE

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,930
MAKING A PLOT, BOKEH'S USING CANVAS TO MAKE THAT.

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,490
BUT WHEN YOU START USING SOME OF THESE WIDGETS, IT ACTUALLY

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,890
STARTS TO INJECT SOME LITTLE BITS OF HTML TO MAKE THAT

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,740
HAPPEN. AND SO HERE IT IS.

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,020
WE'VE USED THE TABS, AND NOW WE HAVE OUR TWO TABS FOR WATER AND

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,390
SANITATION. WE'VE SHARED THE DATA SOURCE

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,670
ACROSS ALL THESE ELEMENTS. SO NOW WHEN I CLICK MALI IN

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,940
SANITATION, IT'S BEING SELECTED OVER IN WATER.

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:50,140
AND IT'S ALL WORKING TOGETHER REALLY QUITE NICELY.

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,649
BUT NOW WE WANT TO GET THAT SLIDER WORKING.

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,750
AND SO TO GET THAT SLIDER WORKING, WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,720
GONNA DO IS, WE'RE GONNA UPDATE THE DATA SOURCE.

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,510
WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY HAVE THE DATA CHANGE WHEN WE MOVE THE

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,870
SLIDER, AND TO DO THIS, WE BRING IN THE BOKEH SERVER.

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,960
AND WHAT THE BOKEH SERVER DOES IS, NOW INSTEAD OF THAT CODE

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,070
COMING DOWN TO YOUR CLIENT, YOU PREPARE YOUR CODE, BUT YOU SEND

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,539
AN INSTRUCTION TO THE SERVER, HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND TO

00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,840
THE DATA? AND SO WHEN YOUR CLIENT WANTS TO

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,440
GET THE PLOT, THE JSON COMES DOWN THE SERVER, BUT A WEB

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:37,470
SOCKET CONNECTION ALSO GETS --

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,210
PUSHED RIGHT DOWN FOR YOU. SO TO DO THAT, WE -- WE CREATE

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:49,669
WHAT I CALL AS LIKE A SERVER APP, LIKE A -- LIKE A BOKEH APP.

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,679
AND IN PARTICULAR, WE WANT TO SPECIFY THE INSTANCES OF THINGS

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,429
THAT THE SERVER NEEDS TO CARE ABOUT.

00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,130
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WHEN THEY CHANGE OR WHEN THEY UPDATE

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,130
LIKE THE SERVER NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT.

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,260
AND THIS KIND OF BLUEPRINT NEEDS TO -- IF YOU -- SOMETIMES YOU

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,210
HOST YOUR BOKEH SERVER AND YOUR WEB APPLICATION SERVER ON THE

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,600
SAME PLACE -- AND IT'S TOTALLY EASY, AND THE BOKEH EXAMPLES

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,770
SHOW IT REALLY NICELY, BUT SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO HOST THEM

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,490
IN DIFFERENT PLACES, AND THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,960
THE SERVER AND YOUR ORIGINAL WEB APP HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,990
HOW TO PUT YOUR BOKEH APP TOGETHER.

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,610
SO YOU HAVE THESE INSTANCES SPECIFIED.

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,590
AND ON YOUR WEB APP, YOU JUST GO THROUGH THE REGULAR THING OF

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,299
CREATING THE PLOT. YOU MAKE THE MAP.

00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,240
YOU MAKE THE TEXT BOX. YOU PUT THE DATA.

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,470
YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. IT'S NICE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD.

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,750
AND ON THE SERVER SIDE, YOU START BINDING EVENTS TO THOSE

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,880
OBJECTS. SO THE YEAR SLIDER THAT WE'RE

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,309
GONNA SEE, WHEN THAT VALUE CHANGES, WE'RE GONNA SAY, PLEASE

00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,501
CALL THE CHANGE YEAR METHOD. WHAT IT'S GONNA DO, THE REAL

00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:05,100
MAGIC HERE IS WHEN SELF.SOURCE.DATA CHANGES, AND ON

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,970
THE SERVER SIDE, THE SERVER THEN KNOWS, OH, I'VE UPDATED.

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,470
SHOOT THAT BACK DOWN TO THE CLIENT.

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,799
AND THAT'S THE MAGIC THAT REALLY LETS BOKEH DO SOME REALLY

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,570
POWERFUL THINGS. SO NOW WE'VE DONE THAT.

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,800
WE'RE ALL DONE. HERE'S OUR SLIDER.

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,860
OH, HANG ON. ACTUALLY, THIS IS MUCH CLEARER

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,890
ON THIS -- OH. THAT IS AWKWARD.

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,820
I THINK I EMBEDDED THE WRONG THING.

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,950
OKAY. IT TOTALLY WORKS.

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,640
I'M VERY SORRY. AND I WILL TWEET YOU THE LINK

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,890
LATER IF I CAN'T GET IT TO WORK MAGICALLY NOW, BUT I'M GONNA

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,890
KEEP GOING BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A BIT SHORT ON TIME.

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:54,360
SO... SO SOME OF YOU MAY BE SITTING THERE THINKING, DO I

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,480
REALLY NEED TO SET UP AN ENTIRE SERVER TO HAVE A SLIDER ON MY

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,490
DATA VISUALIZATION? AND THAT IS A PRETTY FAIR

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,560
QUESTION. THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, BUT.

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,430
AND THE YES, BUT IS MULTIFOLD. SO THE FIRST THING IS, THERE IS

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,630
REALLY AWESOME THING COMING INTO BOKEH IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,100
CALLED THE JAVASCRIPT ACTIONS FRAMEWORK, AND THAT IS GONNA LET

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,250
YOU START WRITING LITTLE PIECES OF PYTHON CODE THAT ACTUALLY

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,070
MAKE JAVASCRIPT ACTIONS HAPPEN. AND THERE'S ALREADY ONE OF THEM

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,980
IN THE REPO CALLED OPEN URL, BUT THAT EXACT ACTION FRAMEWORK IS

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,840
TOTALLY WHAT I WOULD USE TO POWER THAT SLIDER, AND SO THAT'S

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,190
COMING REALLY SOON. THE SECOND THING IS, THAT I --

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,370
THIS IS A PRETTY TRIVIAL EXAMPLE, BUT THE SERVER IS

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,779
REALLY AWESOME, AND YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY WANT TO USE IT

00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,701
FOR MUCH MORE COMPLICATED AND INTERESTING THINGS THAN WHAT WE

00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:55,210
JUST DID. DATA MANIPULATION, DOWNPLAYING,

00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,170
LIKE IF YOU HAVE -- LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A LINE WITH 10 MILLION

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,330
POINTS IN IT, SO YOU START REALLY ZOOMED OUT.

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,789
JUST THE SET OF DATA WE CAN SEE, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR USER ZOOM IN

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:08,669
AND ZOOM IN AND ZOOM IN AND JUST BE SENDING THE DATA THAT THEY

00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:11,809
CAN ACTUALLY SEE. YOU CAN BE STREAMING YOUR DATA.

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:16,440
YOU CAN HAVE SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE LIKE ALWAYS BE UPDATING

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,480
YOUR PLOT SOURCE, AND THEN THOSE DATA CHANGES ARE GONNA COME DOWN

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,450
TO YOUR PLOT. AND LASTLY THERE'S ALWAYS BOKEH

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,590
JS. AND ACTUALLY I DON'T USE IT

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,480
MUCH, BUT I USE IT TO MAKE MY PLOTS RESPONSIVE.

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,870
SO IN WEB DESIGN, PEOPLE HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF BROWSER

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,429
SIZES, SO I DON'T WANT MY PLOT TO ONLY LOOK NICE ON ONE SIZE OF

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,770
BROWSER, SO I USE IT TO RESIZE MY PLOTS WHENEVER THE WINDOW

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,340
SIZE CHANGES, AND THE CODE FOR THAT IS IN THIS REPO TALK AND

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:57,210
YOU CAN GO AND CHECK THAT OUT. SO SOME WRAP-UP THOUGHTS.

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,690
BACK TO THE HIGH LEVEL SHOTS, THEY'RE AN AWESOME WAY TO GET

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,540
STARTED. I USE THEM ALL THE TIME.

00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,950
I OFTEN USE THEM IN A KIND OF FRANKENSTEINY KIND OF WAY WHERE

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,150
I WILL START WITH A CHART, TAKE A BUNCH OF STUFF OUT, THEN ADD

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,790
SOME GLYPHS AND MASH SOME STUFF UP LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S A

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,639
REALLY FAST WAY TO GET SOMETHING UP.

00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:23,490
THE SECOND THING IS ABOUT CSS. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,610
JUST IN CANVAS, YOU DON'T NEED ANY CSS.

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,929
BUT SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE THE HOVER STYLINGS, THE WIDGETS THAT

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,580
WE USED, THE SLIDER, THAT NEEDS SOME CSS.

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,590
UNFORTUNATELY, BOKEH'S CURRENT BUILD IN CSS IS ABOUT A

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,870
MEGABYTE, AND THAT'S TOO BIG FOR ME.

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:47,720
ROLL MY OWN CSS FOR MY WEB APPLICATION.

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,500
SOME FINAL THOUGHTS. IN THE BOKEH REPO, THERE IS AN

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,960
EXAMPLES FOLDER. ON THE BOKEH.PY DATA WEBSITE,

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,070
THERE IS A GALLERY WHICH HAS MAYBE 20 OR SO EXAMPLES IN IT,

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,490
BUT IN THE EXAMPLES FOLDER, THERE'S LIKE WELL OVER 100

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,870
EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,860
THINK OF. AND SO I TOTALLY RECOMMEND USING

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,760
THAT AS A RESOURCE TO REALLY DIG IN TO HOW BOKEH WORKS.

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,679
THE BOKEH TEAM ARE PLANNING TO HAVE 1.0 UP BY THE END OF YEAR,

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,950
SO IT'S COME A LONG WAY IN A YEAR, AND IT'S REALLY STARTING

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,150
TO KIND OF BED DOWN AND BE NICE AND STABLE AND REALLY USEABLE.

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,380
LASTLY, IF YOU WANT TO GET A SERVER UP AND RUNNING, IT CAN A

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,010
LITTLE BIT TRICKY, BUT I HAVE A REPO YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN,

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,480
WHICH IS HOW GET YOUR SERVER DEPLOYED ONTO HEROKU.

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,990
I LOVE BOKEH, AND THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT I WISH I COULD

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,029
HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. I'M AROUND DURING THE SPRINTS.

00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:47,789
COME AND FIND ME, OR THE BOKEH COMMUNITY IS REALLY, REALLY

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:52,289
FRIENDLY. CHECK OUT THE GOOGLE GROUP, AND

00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:55,190
AGAIN, THE CODE FOR THIS SLIDE IS ONLINE.

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,830
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ Applause ]

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:09,010
YEAH, THAT'S FINE. >> WE HAVE TIME FOR JUST ONE OR

00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,269
TWO QUESTIONS, IF YOU WANT TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE HERE.

00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,980
AS ALWAYS, WE PLAY BY JEOPARDY RULES.

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,919
YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION.

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,990
>> EXCELLENT TALK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,490
YOU OBVIOUSLY LIKE THE FRAMEWORK.

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,350
CAN YOU JUST QUICKLY SAY HOW FAST IT WAS FOR YOU TO COME UP

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,159
TO SPEED? YOU KNOW, HOW GOOD WAS IT TO

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,150
COME UP TO SPEED? WHAT WAS YOUR RAMP UP?

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,310
>> I WOULD SAY THAT'S A HARD QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE I

00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,899
STARTED WITH BOKEH ABOUT A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO WHEN IT

00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:45,059
WAS AT 0.4, AND SO EVERYTHING WAS CHANGING KIND OF FAST, AND

00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,690
THE DOCUMENTATION WASN'T WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,290
THERE HAS BEEN HUGE PUSH IN THE LAST, LIKE, MONTH OR SO ON THE

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,529
DOCUMENTATION, AND THEY'RE STILL DOING IT, AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY

00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,210
VERY EASY TO USE WITH THE COMPONENTS THAT I SHOWED YOU.

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,570
I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO GET STARTED TODAY THAN

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,350
TOMORROW. AND IF I FAIL TO LIVE UP TO THAT

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,500
PROMISE, YOU CAN HUNT ME DOWN ON THE INTERNET, AND I WILL HELP

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,660
OUT WITH THAT, SO -- >> WITH THE W.A.S.H. PROJECT,

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,520
YOU MENTIONED IT WAS IN D3, AND IT ENDED UP STAYING IN D3.

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,159
AND YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU WOULD STILL DO IT IN D3.

00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,380
IS THERE A REASON WHY? >> YES, FOR TODAY BECAUSE OF THE

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,059
SLIDER. SO IF YOU ASK ME, IF I WAS DOING

00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:33,429
THIS AGAIN IN THREE MONTHS TIME, WHEN THAT JAVASCRIPT ACTIONS

00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:38,740
FRAMEWORK IS AVAILABLE, THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, I

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,639
WOULD HAVE TO SEARCH FOR A REASON NOT TO USE BOKEH IN THAT

00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:49,299
INSTANCE, BUT AS OF TODAY, TODAY, I WOULD STILL GO WITH D3.

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,200
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TALK. I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU HAD

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,020
OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF USING CANVAS OR WEB

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,150
GL FOR RENDERING RATHER THAN SVG.

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,220
>> THAT IS NOT MY FIELD OF EXPERTISE.

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,480
I -- THERE ARE WHOLE THINGS ABOUT WHICH IS FASTER AND WHICH

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,929
INSTANCES AND SO ON, AND THERE ARE BLOG POSTS ON THE INTERNET

00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:14,429
THAT WILL ANSWER THAT MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN.

00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:19,830
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S SOME REALLY OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,580
WHEN YOU WANT TO THROW ANY KIND OF DECENT SIZED AMOUNT OF DATA

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,200
AT IT. AT SOME LEVEL, I THINK THEY'VE

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,250
BECOME A BIT OF A TOSS-UP, BUT PEOPLE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME CAN

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,450
ANSWER THAT MUCH BETTER, I'M SURE.

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,730
>> GREAT. LET'S THANK SARAH ONE MORE TIME.

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:36,740
