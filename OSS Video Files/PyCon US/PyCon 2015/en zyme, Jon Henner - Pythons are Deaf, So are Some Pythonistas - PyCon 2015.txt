	"Speakers: en zyme, Jon Henner

ASL, like Python, is a language which is both fun and powerful. We have used Python to build a tool, ASL-CLeaR (American Sign Language Concept Learning Resource)  for the DHH community which will teach STEM terminology using ASL exclusively. We are also building a summer program to teach Python in English/ASL to DHH students.
