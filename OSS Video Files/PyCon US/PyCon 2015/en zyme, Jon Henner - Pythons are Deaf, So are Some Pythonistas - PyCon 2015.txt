Title: en zyme, Jon Henner - Pythons are Deaf, So are Some Pythonistas - PyCon 2015
Publication date: 2015-04-12
Playlist: PyCon 2015
Description: 
	"Speakers: en zyme, Jon Henner

ASL, like Python, is a language which is both fun and powerful. We have used Python to build a tool, ASL-CLeaR (American Sign Language Concept Learning Resource)  for the DHH community which will teach STEM terminology using ASL exclusively. We are also building a summer program to teach Python in English/ASL to DHH students.

	00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,490
we're about to begin the second talk of

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,630
this session so presenting right now we

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,230
have enzyme John Henner and Hakim in

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,690
absentia and the subject of this talk is

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,060
going to be pythons are deaf so are some

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:30,660
pythonista x' so please give your

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:33,630
attention for this talk thank you hello

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,510
everyone I get tired of hearing the

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,000
sound of my own voice so you won't have

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,190
to hear it much either

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,289
I go by enzyme because over my career

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,000
over 35 years in IT I've really enjoyed

00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:54,570
accelerating projects and activities

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,410
I met John about a year ago and we

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,059
clicked and here we are and I think

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,059
that's about all I have to say you'll

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:07,020
fill in the rest of the details

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:08,310
take it away John thank you on oh my

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,290
name is jonathan hunter

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm a doctor Elkanah about the

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,670
University where I do mostly as I study

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,799
how it's working acquire relational

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,600
thinking my spare time I enjoy playing

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
with Python I'm not very good but I'm

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,080
trying to get better but I could take a

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,390
few minutes to talk about what we're

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,390
doing about the University we have two

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,909
different projects then we'll talk about

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,590
first tooth ASL clear project and second

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,000
is our attempt to create a summer camp

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,090
for deaf children where we teach them

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,680
how to use the Python language typically

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,180
you will not present to a deaf audience

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
I take a few minutes to pause in between

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,310
slides to give people an opportunity to

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,350
read the files before they have to look

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,810
at the interpreter I'm going to be

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,759
following that as a matter of routine so

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,590
if I start pausing during the slide that

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,970
just made but new to actually read

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,970
before I talk

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,289
after five days deaf and hard of hearing

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,810
people are all low incident population

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:11,720
we should great for Humanity but not so

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,519
great for the deaf community so for most

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,410
of you I may be the first person maybe

00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,269
the first up person you've ever met and

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,580
I may also be the last deaf person

00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:25,489
you've ever met and I'm really sorry

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:28,160
about that because of different

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:29,569
circumstances most deaf children will

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,390
experience some form of language

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,860
deprivation it doesn't matter what kind

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,500
of assistive technology which are

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,170
implanted or used because of like the

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,349
different variety of factors is for

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,890
example a lack of air so - like a rural

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:47,870
accessible language it's especially a

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,480
lack of air said - incidental language

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,340
learning most deaf children will

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,319
unfortunately be unable to acquire

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,799
language like a typical hearing person

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,329
different interventions need to be used

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,950
we are both the University of Leeds at

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,350
the most accessible language sign

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,660
language because it requires no

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,519
expensive technologies it doesn't

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,739
require medical intervention doesn't

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,230
require speech therapists audiologists

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,299
what it requires is a person who knows

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,900
ASL fluently and can model it

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:16,900
appropriately

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,470
as the population because of no

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,200
disability Apollo Texas world language

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,459
deprivation a very small percentage of

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,099
judgment harder feeling children

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,690
actually make it into stem field much

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,370
smaller than would be expected for the

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,300
portion of the population that are deaf

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,060
and hard of hearing

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,890
this is problematic because Tim field

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,720
particularly with STEM careers are one

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,900
of the best way to a middle class income

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,519
for a wide variety of people and the

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,080
universe do these statistics are

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,930
something like sixty percent of deaf and

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,849
hard-of-hearing people are unemployed so

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,470
clearly this is a problem that we need

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:04,989
to fix the biggest problem especially

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,290
for deaf and hard of hearing people who

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,630
rely on sign languages after language

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:15,099
modality of choice they test dumb

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,989
concept a largely inaccessible for

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,549
example a lot of teachers and

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,620
interpreters for the deaf and hard of

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,660
hearing don't have a good command at the

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,500
vocabulary necessary to accurately

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,870
translate a lot of dumb jargon if you

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,490
have not had a science education how

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,350
would you translate programming terms

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,500
from English to sign language there's

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,639
just not a lot of resources out there

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,950
furthermore a lot of some concept

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,810
acquire advanced cognitive ability

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,450
either usually not afforded to people

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,250
that have language deprivation a lot of

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,919
the cognitive abilities that we depend

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,080
on for example mathematic knowledge or

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,270
meddling with technology allows that the

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,490
easily turns for what we know from one

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,830
language to another those things require

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,510
a crystallite linguistic foundation that

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,520
because they've killed other acquiring

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,289
language later or there's a lot of gaps

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,060
in the knowledge those cognitive

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:11,620
functions usually don't come before a so

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,960
we recognized that there was a large

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,880
issue and although there are other

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,919
options we felt they were insufficient

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,630
to meet the needs of our hard of hearing

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,840
interpreters and educators out in the

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,840
world

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,940
this is where the air stops their

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,120
project came to fresh they are so clear

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,130
project out Samara TAS American Sign

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Language concept learning and

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:46,229
educational resource what we do is what

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,600
we take an English word and we

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,370
translated into sign language we don't

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,830
just provide them a one-to-one mapping

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,229
from the a also assigned to the English

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,910
word what we do is we follow appropriate

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,759
learning procedures appropriate

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,120
educational methods and we add much

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,580
these vocabulary and lecture definition

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,259
explanation pretty much all the context

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,740
that we expect to be necessary in order

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,500
not only learn the word or memorize it

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:18,240
but understand how to apply it in gala

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,500
if therefore we've created an entire

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,169
life but not just of the words

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,970
themselves but the lecture that the

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,240
words are in bed again what these words

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,729
mean you know in the signs themselves of

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,080
course we've organized them by category

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:36,740
I promise you we'll talk about Python

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,740
Ebanks I

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,699
one of the challenges of developing this

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,289
application for a very unique community

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,529
was understanding what was the deaf

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,210
person need and web design when people

00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:56,219
talk about web standards they typically

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,930
develop for a very small percentage of

00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,619
the spectrum or the very small

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,819
proportion of the population however

00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:05,550
people that have different language in

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,439
different cultures usually view or they

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,990
usually have different needs and what is

00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,580
appropriate for good design in the deaf

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,339
and hard of hearing population there is

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,339
a theory an architectural theory called

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,309
deaf space you can usually see examples

00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:23,279
of deaf space at death Central Asia for

00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:26,879
example Gallaudet University and NTID

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,430
where they have built no buildings and

00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,960
environment uniquely suited for the

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,490
every time hard-of-hearing person's

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,509
needs

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,830
well the open spaces unobtrusive designs

00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,360
like for example you're usually not

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,789
going to find a pillar in the middle of

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,649
the room though it's very awkward and

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,589
take up space and they block everyone to

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:49,169
it what's going on so we want you to

00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:51,389
take the geometric architectural concept

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,459
and apply them to web design what does

00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,919
it mean to design something for a very

00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,659
visual population there's not a lot of

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,550
information out there so a lot of what

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:03,319
we had to do is we had to create and

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,319
we're still learning as we go

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,440
the project associated development of

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,110
three different applications firstly the

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,970
vetting tool and the vetting to allowed

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,740
to say this sign is not only a good sign

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,720
because we couldn't just invent science

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,979
it's not like inventing vocabulary you

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,990
have to have a strong linguistic

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,479
foundation I had to follow the correct

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,930
grammar and have to be conceptually

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,560
accurate so we had to recruit deaf

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:44,019
people specifically native signers which

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,970
are very very small population of a very

00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,459
very small population people who are

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,829
truly fluent in the language and didn't

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,050
just learn it later in life and then we

00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:55,480
had to find not only native deaf signers

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,660
but native deaf signers who work in the

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,880
scientific field which is pretty much a

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,250
unicorn here in the States will not see

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,089
other states there in this days that are

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:10,450
there better the second thing is we had

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,089
to develop according to the challenge of

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,540
the quotient rule was how do you get

00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:21,279
computer to recognize a sign a visual

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:23,290
language it's easy enough or easier with

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,950
spoken languages that have writing

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,839
systems you can feel a corporal onto a

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,930
computer again pretty much learn the

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,480
language by analyzing the print form

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,610
they're making great advances and no

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,899
analyte in spoken languages you can see

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,540
they for example on the glue

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,610
I'll go caption programming but son

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,370
language because they had simultaneous

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,140
grammars which means that different part

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,120
of the synthetic or morphological

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,089
structure are happening at the same time

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,740
I hesitate to use the interpreter as an

00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,070
example but you can see how for example

00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:00,520
spatial morphology it's being used at

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,899
the same time and space as many of you

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,699
know a lot better than I do it's

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:08,500
extremely difficult for computers to

00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:12,370
understand so the coding to allowed or

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,769
to assign labels to different parts of

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,990
the signs so that the computer could

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,880
better understand what they were and of

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,610
course the actual search tool which

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,370
stakeholders that you defined the

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:30,470
embedded

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:32,270
Tembo cabaret as mentioned before we had

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,400
to create some way of authorizing

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,120
whether or not a stem translation was a

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,570
good one

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,440
does it follow proper ASL grammar does

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,180
it follow like the actual concept if

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,890
people look at the Sun can they by

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,200
taking apart the different parts of the

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,029
sign can they use the metallurgic

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,830
document to understand what they're

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:57,770
talking about so here I'm going to show

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,310
you a little video at the bedding to on

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,890
action and you can see as I was in

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,960
narrate hope they like the different

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,970
parts for the web design deaf space that

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,680
we included you can see one of the

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,510
things we wanted to deal with he wanted

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,940
assure that there was no English in the

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,220
tool and the reason for that is because

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,920
it's research showed that if you're a

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,900
user of a minority language you will

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,240
default to the syntactical pattern to

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,040
the dominant language and we really want

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,930
you to pull that out and just have them

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,770
use what they knew about sign language

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,260
so all the links everything with an ASL

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,830
you can see that one of the things we

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,860
had to do was we had to do we have each

00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:45,560
of the link play when let's click to how

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,540
do we get the assign to the user in the

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,060
easily understandable way so that will

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,700
understand how things will only intent

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,800
whether to each other how to use them so

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,620
what we decided was the best way to do

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,860
those were to use the mouse over

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,440
technique you can I'm going to back up a

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,120
little bit over here and I want you guys

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,820
to see this better I'll show you a

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,010
picture later but how we ended up doing

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:15,140
them without that we provided the links

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,940
you can see over here and these are ways

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,490
for the better to control the vending

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,110
application for example do they want to

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,640
see the term do they want to see the

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,110
definition do they want to see the

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,270
lecture itself and the videos play here

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,959
and everything everything had done

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,990
through sign language and that little

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,850
modal window allowed fetter to say

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,670
this is a good sign that it using

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:48,230
contact we approve of this everything is

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:51,620
hunky-dory we use as many you can see a

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,630
licker system there are some

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,850
disadvantages to using a locker but for

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,770
what it is it's actually pretty good you

00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,570
allowed to you the summative scale to

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,850
determine whether or not the words were

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:12,649
like good over a course of several

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:17,480
different betters yeah moving on this is

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:19,370
the still shot of the betting tool you

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,880
can see that the terms that have to be

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,649
vetted are on the top and then as I

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,670
mentioned before the links are on the

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,870
side this is the basic navigation and

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:35,720
this was a really interesting

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:39,050
development it really gave us an idea

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:46,459
and to easily visualize what did the

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:48,170
Deaf space in the web design meant the

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:51,860
coding tool had talked a little bit

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:55,190
about this it's allowed yourself to map

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,380
the different parts of the ASL sign to

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,450
specific identifiers so the computer

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,120
actually understand what sign is we're

00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,220
in the database this was extremely

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,430
challenging for a lot of youth and one

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,860
is because the simultaneous grammars of

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:14,480
sign language the second edge we had a

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,120
large discussion within our team was how

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
do you identify the individual parts and

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,010
what were called assignment dream which

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,529
is the beginning of the sign to the end

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,260
of the Sun and all the hand shapes

00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:30,010
movements and locations between the

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,010
beginning and the end

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:42,389
at ASL has no written system we had to

00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:45,509
find a ways that take hold it could

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,649
easily you know search for the sign

00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:52,889
do you think the different parts of the

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:55,499
sign one of the things we did is we

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,179
defaulted to a graphing system of dollar

00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,699
a used in several schools for the Deaf

00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:02,909
across the country this Apollo Subic

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:06,659
system and these are different parts of

00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:10,679
the hand shapes so what so what you to

00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:12,439
do it they code they wash the sign they

00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,609
code the first two handshape

00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:17,639
particularly the dominant hand and the

00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:20,009
base hand although we have the ability

00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,889
to code all the handshape from the sign

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,869
team we decided that to make it easier

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:27,929
for stakeholder that we would only use

00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:30,869
two handshape one location and two

00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:39,779
movements an external movement and an

00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:42,329
internal movement ultimately the goal is

00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,179
to build a search tool which allows the

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:49,109
holder to use ASL and ASL printable to

00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:50,970
search for certain vocabulary in ASL one

00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,769
of the most important things about it

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,899
that we wanted to make sure that users

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,539
would have instantaneous feedback as

00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,519
they picked the graph team necessary we

00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,639
fell to having quick feedback from the

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,169
background will allow students to learn

00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,449
if they were selecting different parts

00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:08,159
of the sign for example they selected

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:09,989
the wrong handshape and a different type

00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,479
of video would pop up we want them to

00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:14,639
say oh no no no I didn't want that video

00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:16,979
so they can deselect the different

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,129
grapheme to put in a new graph in this

00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:23,729
was a technological for us this would

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:25,409
really knew we had to use WebSocket to

00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:27,359
get it done it's not something we are

00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:30,329
seeing anything elsewhere for a video

00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:32,219
search engine so for a fault it was a

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,539
lot of pushing boundaries learning about

00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,919
how to use the different tools in a way

00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,759
that was suitable for the in each

00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,759
population

00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:49,480
I did tell you that there would be

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:52,329
actually some Python in here this is the

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,160
diagram that we did this commander

00:16:52,329 --> 00:17:05,470
though just plays how're different

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:08,289
projects to work together they have to

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,270
largely written in Python 3 when we

00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:12,370
started for just about three years ago I

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,829
was tagged to select the language for

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,480
which that we would like and I was

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,429
looking at two languages I was looking

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,490
at boobie and I was looking at Python

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:24,130
and I'm in our program or I'm a

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,620
researcher so this was all very new for

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,909
me so the first thing I did was I looked

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,820
at the description to the different

00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:33,640
languages I looked at Ruby and Ruby was

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,760
like yes we're chaotic were hard to read

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,820
but we get stuff done and then I looked

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,990
at Python and it was simple elegant and

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,640
easy to read as we usually rotate our

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,500
teams we have a new team every year

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,289
because we rely a lot on student

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,200
programmers who unfortunately graduate

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,510
and go out in the world so every year we

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,340
have to train a new team and I realized

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,549
that I needed the code to be portable

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,500
from new team to new team to new team so

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,350
readability any years of learn was

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:09,279
really important to us so because of

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:11,590
that we decided to go to Python our lead

00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,740
programmer was picked Python 3 whose

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,950
reasons I cannot explain but I can tell

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,990
you what I like Python 3 as the non

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,409
programmer I found it very difficult to

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,510
install dependencies in Python 2.7 the

00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:27,100
other day I learned to Python 3 there

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,640
was a little function I could use called

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,240
pip where I could just type out parts on

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,429
3 - pip install and they took care of

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,179
everything for me I have to tell you

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,179
that was fabulous

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:53,970
for the back gun a programmer does not

00:18:49,600 --> 00:19:00,039
like using sko so he really enjoyed

00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:02,500
particularly flask which was easy to get

00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,840
started had a great community of course

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,580
no the well-tested framework easily

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,700
maintained and it came with that Kalka

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,610
me was it very important for out the

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,889
database it's one of the most important

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,600
part of our projects we have to store

00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:25,090
all the video we have to store all the

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,710
coding all the signs our program has

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,710
found the flower manager to be

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,509
acceptable and easy and I'm really

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,460
emphasizing the easy part here because

00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:35,320
as I mentioned every year returned a new

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,250
program and came from the undergrad and

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,250
grad to join us

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,059
I especially happy about hi charm one of

00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,710
the nice thing about coming here that we

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,990
were able to talk to the PI charm to him

00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,940
and then they were able to like you know

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,500
the two of been really great first they

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,360
have an educational additions a

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:11,960
programmers have been very happy with

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:13,700
that so the main takeaway I want you to

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,890
walk away from there yourself I'd the

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,840
affair project it's one of the Python

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,450
had a strong motor planning niche

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,850
educational application there's a great

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,860
community the language is easy to learn

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:30,260
even though it easy to learn it very

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:32,179
powerful and allows small research teams

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,990
like our to eat you know get into the

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:37,549
community give speeches like this and

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:41,660
find a new generation of Python

00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:44,299
programmers we have trained I think

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,640
three different teams now over the past

00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:48,350
couple of years when we get them they

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,179
don't know a lot of programming but well

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,370
what they learned from us they learn how

00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,049
to work with deaf and hard of hearing

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,540
population they learn how to work with

00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,250
the research team they learn they learn

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,150
how to work with different personalities

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,440
and the dynamic environments and then

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,340
they go on for the world they are in

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,340
three times what I do

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,600
the second thing I wanted to talk about

00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:17,950
is the Python summer camp occurred over

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,809
the course of the past couple of years

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,539
we fall in love with the Python language

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,399
and we've just started there it's one of

00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:27,610
the easiest angrist more the best

00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:30,640
language to introduce programming to

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,740
deaf and hard-of-hearing children again

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,960
altima goal to try to provide middle

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,179
class lifestyle to the deaf and hard of

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,419
hearing people most of them who whoever

00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:43,120
reasoned for example language

00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:46,960
deprivation not access to limited role

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,019
models don't really feel that they can

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,080
make it out in the world we feel

00:21:50,019 --> 00:22:02,139
strongly that Python is a tool that can

00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:04,690
build confidence and knowledge now these

00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:06,580
the summer camp for deaf kids was

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,460
originally started by Richard Ladner at

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:12,580
the University of Washington if summer

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,549
camp had a broader focus than ours we're

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,590
less interested and some of the other

00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:20,980
topics they taught for example animation

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,070
we felt strongly that we wanted if we

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,440
had a smaller focus on a single talk but

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:30,450
that we could provide a much stronger

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,450
education over a shorter period of time

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,950
one of the challenges have been a little

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,700
incident population especially in the

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,230
area of ID a and mainstream education

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,460
that you really don't have access to a

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,000
community of people who are like

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,650
yourself one of the downfalls or one of

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,900
the pitfalls of ID a mentioned

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,510
medication that the focus is on

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,530
educating to see so-called normal people

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:05,500
at the expense of that stable person so

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,290
a lot of deaf people go up they never

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,970
meet another deaf person a lot of deaf

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,770
children go up they don't realize that

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,020
there are deaf adults outside in the

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,510
world they think that they will become

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,860
here and when they're 20 and I have met

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:22,270
people who thought that deaf people

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:26,500
simply die when they become adults I am

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,840
pretty sure that's not the case so we

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,160
really wanted to ensure that the deaf

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,900
and hard of hearing kids had an

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,240
opportunity of socializing others like

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,040
themselves and most importantly we want

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,520
to introduce them to the Python language

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,080
and to death stem professionals who

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,240
exist out there in the world to provide

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,740
role model to provide interaction

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,930
experiences and to teach them their you

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:59,620
know deaf people can succeed in stem

00:23:49,930 --> 00:24:01,300
field despite all in all challenges to

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,160
this audience I don't really have to

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,640
explain why python is one of the best

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,700
tools as an educational tool as an

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,040
educational language and for community

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,350
that has suffered so many different

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:20,100
challenges so I'll turn this over to Ann

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,100
at the last key Mara

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:31,380
hurry live thank you okay rather than

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,290
taking up any more bandwidth right now

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,850
with details they I'm happy to drill

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,730
down just catch me outside the

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:42,160
conference or send John or I or Hakim

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,760
our third speaker wasn't able to attend

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:49,110
because of visa issues let's go right

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,110
into Q&A

00:24:53,710 --> 00:25:11,630
yes thank you okay first question first

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:15,610
of all thank you for giving such a great

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:18,860
talk I know you must have practiced a

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,960
lot in order to do this so well my

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,900
brother is actually studying to become

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,130
an ASL interpreter and I know he would

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,500
be very interested in learning more

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,500
what's the best way for him to do that

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,480
they offer many different 90p program

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,100
it'll cost you nowadays

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,770
18:18 are you American or maybe I should

00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,550
not assume the American I'm sorry he's

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:48,800
already in a program in Colorado

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,200
I was wondering what's the best way for

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,770
him to learn more about the work that

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,930
you're doing

00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:59,270
oh my work we were going to be releasing

00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,360
these applications within the next year

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:07,490
so right now the best way to go to learn

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:16,820
about a worker to go to bu dot edu slash

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:18,620
c SCD thank you CF CDE if I were smart

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:25,880
and I am NOT I will put that on their

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:29,960
sides next question so would you mind

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:33,380
going back to your interface and

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,720
breaking down a little bit more what you

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,490
mean by the term and the context and so

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,590
on and so forth and then perhaps maybe

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,830
even before you do the interface

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,230
go back to your grid and break down a

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:48,440
little bit about the pieces of the sign

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:51,110
what a handshape is and how positioning

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,040
works and all that stuff so we can map

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:58,010
better to what you're showing us okay

00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:01,930
thickly hmm

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,930
it dictor side you want or did

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,950
okay

00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:10,940
Airtel has five different parameters mid

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,679
parameters correspond to for example in

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,539
the spoken language do you have the

00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,929
phonetic Xbox fighters phonetic powers

00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,700
phonemic and phonetic for spoken

00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,130
languages are usually regarding to the

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,139
position in the lips the position of the

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,450
tongue and whether or not it's adequate

00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:29,750
whether or not air is coming out or not

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,539
so those correspond to the phonetic part

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,309
with spoken language it's not it's part

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:35,899
of a visual language active and of

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,120
course they're not using the mouth the

00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:40,820
tongue where the lips were air coming

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,760
from and the voice box instead of using

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,460
things like handshape which is what your

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,200
hands look like how they can't work the

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,549
different location to the joint in the

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:56,750
fingers movements like it's going out

00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:59,389
and no past direction and internal

00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,100
movements which are more finds for

00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:04,519
example twist we go

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,159
you also have location and these are

00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,630
wearing the spatial plan design happened

00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,730
for example does it happen in neutral

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:14,809
space does that happen on the heart does

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:18,139
I happen on the hands you have modifiers

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,850
and these are the stuff that people tend

00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:22,789
to laugh at when they see the emergency

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,789
broadcast like oh the interpreter is

00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:28,039
making such funny faces those are called

00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:29,870
non-manual markers and they're

00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:33,200
inflectional and derivational more

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,899
things derivation means to change it the

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,740
grammatical class of the word it turned

00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:41,419
it from a noun to a verb for example as

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,789
for inflection there are many different

00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:47,899
parts but they tend to change them to

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:50,750
like duration or intensity or manner so

00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:52,549
our challenge again went divided in the

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:56,630
interface which we had to take the

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:59,090
different parts of ASL and say how do we

00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,340
have stakeholders look at all these

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,899
different parts of ASL and determine the

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,510
competition of a sign in order for

00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:08,779
searching we decided to simplify things

00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:11,600
a little bit we're only looking at the

00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,970
three major parameters so instead of

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,159
things like palm orientation

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:21,419
non-manual marker we look at solely

00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:23,370
handshape location movement which we sir

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:28,140
show to be the most salient parts to

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:31,640
dividual modality so the next challenge

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,380
was as I mentioned before the same dream

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,059
so between the beginning and the end of

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,460
the sign you may have many many

00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:41,519
different hand shapes locations and

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,279
movements so again to simplify them

00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,950
sister college we selected two handshape

00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:52,440
a dominant hand and then a base hand for

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,210
example if I'm going to put a car next

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,950
to somewhere I would have it on the base

00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,840
hand which represented ground and of

00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:02,909
course the figure so we decided to

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:14,730
develop the interface according to adult

00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:17,549
with its answer your question okay last

00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,679
question hey thank you very much of the

00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,029
talk this software is really cool it's

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,809
really neat to see you break all this

00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:26,730
out one thing I'm curious is how or even

00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:29,039
if the well hearing programming

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:36,630
community can support the deaf and hard

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:38,309
of hearing community well there is a

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,899
pretty broad question do you have

00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,350
anything specific they would like for me

00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:44,130
to answer

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,659
I suppose in particular in regards to

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,480
these tools that you've put together

00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,950
is there any way for well hearing

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,679
programmers to get involved in efforts

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:57,419
like this I understand that this is

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,070
something that definitely requires a lot

00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,690
of base knowledge as a deaf or

00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,350
hard-of-hearing person yeah let me jump

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:08,490
in

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:10,470
I don't speak or understand ASL I come

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,919
from a mathematics and scientific

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:17,190
programming if you're interested in

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:21,840
solving interesting problems that's all

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:24,330
you need you learn what you need one of

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,419
the things that makes diversity for a

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:30,159
deaf and hard-of-hearing little

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:33,320
different than gender or link other

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,609
spoken languages is the expense of

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:40,820
having interpreters or closed captioning

00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:46,190
it's a major limitation towards career

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:48,440
advancement so one way is to help with

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,460
fundraising and the other is at

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,559
education and being open to alternate

00:31:52,460 --> 00:32:00,499
modes of communication would be a

00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:06,070
texting email and being patient until

00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:06,070
you find a modality that works well John

00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:12,379
we many of the people that join our team

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:16,309
again don't have a background and deaf

00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:18,409
or hard-of-hearing detect no field we

00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,399
train people we teach them how to

00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:22,249
interact with the deaf or

00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:23,720
hard-of-hearing so a lot of the students

00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:25,639
one of the things that they benefit from

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,009
they're learning how to work with these

00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:35,659
know disenfranchised marginalized

00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:38,809
communities so we take everyone okay

00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:41,509
we're out of time for this so again I

00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:45,759
think we should thank this for a very

00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:45,759
interesting very interesting talk

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:56,309
the next talk for this session will

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,309
