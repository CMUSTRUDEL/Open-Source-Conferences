>> Hi, y'all.

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,670
Before I start just very quick announcement.

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,070
If you bought anything at the wonderful PyLadies auction last night you need to pick it up

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,160
at registration.

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,830
During the break.

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,140
I've already picked my tie up.

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
>> Nice tie!

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,550
>> Thank you.

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,579
Good morning I'm Jacob Kaplan-Moss I'm one of the contributors to Django and I'm the

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,420
director of security at Heroku.

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,989
When I say thank you I really mean it.

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,660
It's hard for me to over state just how fantastic it is to be up here speaking to you.

00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,199
This is the highlight of my career.

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,720
This is the apex of everything that I've done and I'm not exaggerating this community means

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,500
more to me than anything in tech, in my professional life.

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,110
I've spoiled the punch line there, didn't I?

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,320
I've been coming here to PyCon for 11 years.

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,850
This is my 11th PyCon this is the 10th anniversary of first getting on stage.

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,720
I gave me first talk at PyCon in 2005 in Washington, D.C.

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,350
I gave a talk on app script, it was utility to bridge apple's AppleScripting framework

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,310
with Py on this.

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,310
Also in 2005 Adrian gave a tech demo of some tools that we were building internally at

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,390
the newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, using to build our websites.

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:59,930
Those tools became Django and now Django is ten years old and is used all around the world

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,070
by thousands of companies in many different industries.

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:10,119
I've watched this conference go from 300 people to close to 3,000.

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,680
I've watched our community explode with new faces and growing diversity.

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:24,890
I've been involved in planning this conference, in membership with the PSF in discussions

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,420
about core language development.

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,180
I've been floating in and out of this community at various levels for a decade.

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,180
When I say this is apex of my professional career I really mean it.

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,290
This is pretty incredible.

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,070
The problem is that right now my main emotion is in security.

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,590
As a voice in the back of my head that's telling me, you don't deserve to be here.

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,400
Look at the amazing people you shared this stage with.

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,690
Who are you?

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,200
What did you do to get up on stage with them?

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,180
You don't belong on stage with them.

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,629
You don't belong or deserve this success.

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,000
Jay smooth calls this voice the little hater.

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,909
Oh, man, audio.

00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,480
>> Let's try that again.

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
��� >> Doctrine is back in effect.

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,870
I haven't done a video in a long time.

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,810
Been a few reasons for that.

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,349
Reason number one, both my cameras managed to stop working.

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,379
Reason number two, I was busy with my first ever trip to Los Angeles.

00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,780
For this big web video event called "the winnis"e shout out to everybody.

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,610
The other reason I haven't been doing videos for awhile basically, I don't always feel

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,440
like I'm cut out to do this stuff.

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,830
I'm sure some people wake up every day feeling confident that the entire world wants to look

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,700
at their face and listen to them talk.

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,380
But I'm not one of those people.

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,129
When I'm in the groove of getting work done I feel like I'm making a connection with you

00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,320
guys out there and my ideas are resonating with you, it feels natural to keep showing

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,130
up and maintaining that connection.

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,180
But if I go too long without putting work in it feels like that connection is broken,

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,930
there's a little voice inside my head that starts playing tricks on me trying to convince

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,819
me that the connection was never really there.

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,000
I think this is true for all creative people that we each have a little hater that lives

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,269
inside our heads tries to set up traps for us.

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,959
Jay's awesome.

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,500
Everything that he's done is fantastic.

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,539
When I hear him talking about his insecurity I think about my little hater, my little hater

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,200
tells me that I don't deserve my success.

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,950
The really insidious thing about this voice for me is that there's like a little bit of

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,729
him that's right.

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,440
And this isn't like a humble brag I'm not being false modest right now, there are things

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,229
that I've done that I'm incredibly proud of there are things that I've been involved in

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,610
and things that I've led that I feel do qualify me to be up here.

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,279
But I don't think they're the things that you're thinking about.

00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,650
You probably think I'm here because I'm the inventor of Django.

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,650
Right?

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,600
But that's not actually true.

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,440
If you know a little more about the story about how Django came to be you might know

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,720
the co-creator of Django.

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,589
That's actually not really true either.

00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:25,080
The fact is that I was hired to work at the newspaper a year after Adrian and Simon invented

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,349
and co-created Django.

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:33,950
Really I'm the guy who got hired to work on the thing a year after it was already made.

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:42,520
But people still assume that I'm somehow responsible, people assume that this is because I'm incredibly

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,020
programmer that I'm a rock star, a Ninja or whatever it is that recruiters are calling

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,310
it these days.

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:59,149
And people suspect that I'm successful because of my programming skill.

00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,550
That's not true.

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:09,349
I'm at best an average programmer.

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:17,130
This is Anne Trason probably the most accomplished ultra marathoner in the history of the sport.

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,099
What's ultra running?

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:24,300
Ultra running is any distance over a marathon over 26 miles.

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,570
Most of these races are on trails, most of them involve substantial climbing, technical

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:37,740
terrain, crossing streams and rivers, some of the hardest races can take multiple days

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,820
of continuous running to complete.

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,940
The common distances in the sport are 50k, 50 miles, and a hundred miles.

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,830
For those who haven't heard of ultra running, a quick FAQ, people really run that far?

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,480
Yes.

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,130
Really?

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,770
Yes.

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:08,300
This is the map of the western states 100 it runs from squaw valley in California, all

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:16,020
the way down to Auburn, again a hundred miles over a pass, all on trails.

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,440
Ann won western states 14 times over about two decades.

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,560
She said, dozens of course records across the country in the '80s and '90s many which

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,210
still stand today 10 or 20 years later.

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,750
In 1994, she set the course record at the leadville 100, this is 100 mile race mostly

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,390
above 10,000 feet.

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,650
Breathing up there is like breathing through a straw.

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:49,150
Her course record, very few people have come within an hour of her record.

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,580
It's never even close.

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,560
That record stood for 20 years and no one's come within smelling distance of it.

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,769
It's hard to think about -- hard to over estimate just how dominant, just how exceptional Ann

00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,990
was in her sport.

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,380
I'm talking about this because as of few weeks ago I get to call myself an ultra runner as

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
well.

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,839
I finished my first 50k.

00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:22,209
[ Applause ] Thank you.

00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:29,070
I'm of course not even remotely in the same league as someone like Ann Trason but I am,

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,320
I do get to wear the same label.

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,709
I'm a mediocre runner.

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,780
I finished 535th out of about a thousand.

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,260
Felt pretty good.

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,571
The thing that is interesting about this sport is that we can quantify it.

00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:54,650
We have lot of numbers that help us figure out how to measure performance, we can talk

00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,270
about pace, talk about distance, we can talk about elevation change, the technicality of

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,270
the terrain.

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:07,020
There's a lot of ways that we can account for the skill gap between me and elite athlete

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,090
like Ann.

00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:18,960
There's one site ultrasignup.com main Url to sign up creative.

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,120
They calculate they call runner's score.

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,460
Mine is 68%, that means across all of the races that I've run I typically finish in

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,520
about 68% slower than the winner.

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,430
So the winner score is go to be 100% someone just barely doesn't win is going to be 99%

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,380
I'm down there like 68%.

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,230
Over states it a little bit, what is cool about this you can look at it broken down

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:55,310
by distance so I can see that my performance falls off as I run farther which means I got

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,310
to work on my endurance.

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:03,610
My score is 68% Ann's is 98.58%.

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,650
In other words, she usually wins.

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,430
Right?

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,670
This isn't surprising that there is that much of a gap between me and average runner elite

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,770
runner.

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,280
If we break down -- were to plot a histogram of all the various times and scored we'd come

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,210
up with a shape like this.

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,470
This should be familiar shape to anyone who has done any rudimentary statistics, a bell

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,890
curve, a normal distribution.

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,460
Most people are average and few people are exceptionally good, few people are exceptionally

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,860
bad on the skinny ends of the curve.

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,180
This isn't a surprise if we see -- when we see this pattern we call it a normal curve.

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,210
Because we see it everywhere.

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:52,680
Almost every skill that we know how to measure ends up showing a distribution something like

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
this.

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,610
With most people behaving around in the middle and few people exceptionally good and few

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,950
people exceptionally bad.

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:09,110
When I said I was mediocre programmer some of you probably didn't believe me.

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,610
I sort much set it up, I led up to it, I spoiled the surprise you probably didn't believe me

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,710
when I said that.

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,740
But why?

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Right?

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,760
We know that most skill tends to fall into this normal distribution.

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,670
So, most of you, the vast majority of you never actually worked with me, why would you

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,650
assume that my coding ability is exceptional?

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,590
Why do you think I'm out there?

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:39,530
What is it about what you've heard, what you see, what you think you know, that makes you

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,720
Intuit that I'm under the skinny end?

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,500
The absence of any other data shouldn't you assume that I'm solidly in the middle?

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,420
Well part of this is that, how do we even measure coding ability?

00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:01,290
We're -- we are so -- we are infants in figuring how to measure our ability to produce software.

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,980
What are our metrics?

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Lines of code?

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,580
What does that measure?

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,810
Story points?

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,560
What even is a story point?

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,860
We'd like to think we work in a field that's very logical and analytical and fact-based.

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,130
But the truth is we don't have any idea how to talk about what we do in any sort of technical

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,380
or systematic way.

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,850
We do what humans do when we don't have data we make up stories.

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,610
This is a human thing, we do it.

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,920
We tell ourselves anecdotes and stories about people's ability to program.

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,720
The problem is that these stories are simplistic, this is what we do as human beings.

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,880
We stereotype.

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,070
We architype we say that people suck at programming.

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,180
We say that people rock at programming.

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,500
We don't leave a lot of room for the in betweens.

00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:02,460
We bucket everyone we know into an amazing programmer or a worthless use of a seat.

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,480
We seem to fall into this assumption that skill in our industry is distributed in a

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,430
U-shaped curve.

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,430
Most people are either on one end of the extreme which doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,590
Aren't you learning throughout our career?

00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:24,500
How would we go from being absolutely terrible to absolutely wonderful any sort of in between.

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,981
But we only tell ourselves these two stories allow ourselves two possible narratives, why

00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:33,120
did you think that I was under the skinny end?

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, you have two narratives, you have crappy crammers and amazing programmers you know

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,070
that I'm associated with Django so the crappy one doesn't seem to fit you pick the good

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,070
one.

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,500
Makes sense, right?

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,710
But we know again that if we could measure programming ability would look like this.

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,710
Why?

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,940
Because most people are average at most things.

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,930
This is not lake Wobegon most people are not above average.

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:06,170
The assumption that programming falls into this bi-modal distribution is dangerous and

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,860
a myth.

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:15,150
And this talent myth sets up a world you can't program unless you're a rock star or a Ninja.

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:20,420
And it's actively harmful this myth is keeping people from programming.

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,220
It's driving them out of programming and it's preventing most of the growth and improvement

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,770
that we'd like to see.

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:42,920
[Applause] The U.S. bureau of labor statistics estimates

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,250
that by 2020 there's going to be a 1.5 million job gap.

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,110
In other words, there is going to be a million and half unfilled programming jobs in the

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,110
U.S.

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,110
By 2020.

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,029
Five years.

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:05,190
The EU published similar numbers, 1.2 million in 2018, three years.

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,590
It's clear from sort of industry standpoint take really broad view we have to be doing

00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,810
something to get more people into our industry.

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,910
Right?

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,710
Sometimes talk about this as the pipeline problem, we need to get more people into tech.

00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,670
The talent myth is a filter on the front of that pipeline.

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,680
Prevents the m from getting into this career, into this job.

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,070
Into learning the skill.

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,770
If we believe talent is Bimodal.

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:46,060
It lends to the belief that either born with programming ability or not.

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,620
That it's innate attribute.

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,630
That you have an innate talent or you simply don't.

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:03,760
Somebody who doesn't know how to write software who believes this myth, I'm 30 or 20 or 15

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,410
and I haven't written code yet I'm never going to.

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,860
Or 40 or 60.

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,000
Only options are amazing or terrible we believe that you have to be passionate about your

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
career.

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,300
You have to think about programming every waking moment of your life because if there's

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,540
only two options the minute you take your eye off of it, you're going to slide right

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,050
from amazing to terrible again.

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,910
So we have to always be working in our off hours, have to be working crazy hours at work

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:44,850
have to study on our own time, et cetera.

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,650
Last year over half a million people ran a marathon.

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,420
Did all of them have innate talent?

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
I doubt it.

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,270
I didn't.

00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,630
I didn't start running until I was 25.

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,640
Most of them like me ran this marathon rather badly.

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,690
A few people out front ran it very, very fast and all of these people, pretty slowly.

00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,309
We don't believe you have to be passionate about running.

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,680
All of it takes is a pair of shoes.

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,829
Don't even believe you have to particularly like it.

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,189
How many runners do you know that kind of hate it?

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:28,760
Someone asked me one time what the best part about running the 50k was I said it was finishing.

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,630
Running a pair on this is really hard.

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,260
It's 26 miles, takes sometimes years of training, thousands of miles, it requires commitment

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,140
and focus.

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,120
Do you think that writing software, that writing Python is harder than running a marathon?

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,000
Why aren't there half a million people here today?

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,140
Why do we tell ourselves such different stories about one skill, coding and another skill,

00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
running.

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:04,840
I want to tell you a little story of what these narratives do to individuals.

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:13,060
Couple years ago I was at Kansas university's GIS day, GIS day are these one-day GIS, geographic

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,490
information systems events held at universities all around the world.

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:27,810
I love going to K.U. it's always exciting and interesting, I'm a total dabbler in GIS

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,950
but great seeing professionals talk about it.

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,990
Each year in the afternoon students give presentations about their projects.

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,840
These are technically detailed, really interesting talks about original research, any one of

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,350
those talks could be a session here at PyCon you'd all think it was the best on the schedule.

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,740
Why aren't these speakers here?

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:59,160
Well, one student a few years ago gave a particularly fantastic presentation, it was about predicting

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,830
seasonal floods on the Kansas river using a combination of historical data and flow

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,010
analysis and rainfall data those sorts of things.

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,700
The tools that used should be pretty familiar to a lot of people in the room.

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:21,260
She used Amazon web services, Linux, Postgres QL, Django, geodjango.

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,050
I was hiring Python developers, she had just written thousands of lines of Python code.

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,360
I asked her if she wanted in to interview with us.

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,110
No, no, I can't do that.

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,530
I'm not really a programmer.

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:42,100
This is woman who had just invented her own cluster distribute geographic information

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,920
systems processing data pipeline.

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,680
But she's not really a programmer.

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,650
Because programming is something you in myth not something you do.

00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,600
The truth is that programming isn't passion, it isn't a talent just like some things that

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
you can learn.

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,610
It's not even one thing, I've been talking about programming as if it were a single thing,

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,740
but that's not actually true.

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,720
Alex when he was reading a draft pointed out to me software development requires all sorts

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,790
of skills, coding is just like one small part of it.

00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,929
We need design, we need communication, we need writing.

00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:28,670
We need debugging we need to have at least one person who understands Unicode.

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:38,331
[ laughter ] There are multiple independent skills, when

00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:45,660
we assume that they're all required to be a programmer, we assume that a person is the

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,500
minimum of their parts.

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:54,120
Sure, you might be able to design well and speak well and write well and you're a great

00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,560
project manager but you don't know how linked list works so get out of the building.

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,780
Like any skill you can program, you can do any of these skills professionally or occasionally

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,240
you can do them as a hobby or part-time job, as a full-time job.

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
You can do them badly.

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,710
You can do them well or most likely you can do them average.

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,600
If we embrace this idea that it's cool to be okay at these skills, that being average

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,920
is fine, it will be less intimidating for newcomers.

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:35,420
If we set the bar for success at okay rather than at exceptional, that bar seems a lot

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,990
easier to clear for people new to our community.

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,980
Even once we get people in, the talent myth haunts people who are already in our community.

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,540
And it actively drives people out of tech.

00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,630
This is the part of a talk that's a little bit of a downer.

00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:03,280
But we have to acknowledge it, it's rife with sexism, racism, homophobia.

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,710
There isn't one cause, but the talent isn't one of them.

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,080
It contributes to these.

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,770
In our industry we have the myth of the brilliant Asshole.

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:22,000
The 10X programmer who is so good at his job that people have to work with him.

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,030
He has such great output that, yeah, he's a jerk, but we still have to work with him

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,410
anyway.

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:34,280
The argument goes that we need this output so the toxic behavior is acceptable.

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,070
Now in reality we know that skill is normally distributed, so it's likely that these people

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,870
aren't actually exceptional.

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,310
But even if we grant that they are, how many developers does a 10X programmer have to drive

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:57,020
away before they -- before it's awash?

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,870
[Applause] More insidiously this idea that programmers

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:10,840
fall into either sucks or rocks categories gives us dangerous Bias I want you to think,

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
answer this question.

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,600
What does a 10X programmer look like?

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,710
We probably thought of someone like this, mark Zuckerberg, a young white man that's

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,620
who we have seen on the media, don't spoil it.

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,280
That's who we've seen on the media.

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,370
In tech company mastheads and so on.

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:36,309
But that's not actually mark, that's Jessie Isenberg who played him in a major motion

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:41,400
picture about a young white man founding a tech company.

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
That's mark Zuckerberg.

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,470
Sorry that's not.

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:54,230
That's Andy sandberg, Andy is an actor on "Saturday night live" who played Jessie Isenberg

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:02,830
playing mark Zuckerberg, I think that's mark Zuckerberg.

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,290
I'm trying to be funny here, I guess for some of you I succeeded.

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:12,350
There's a point here, this young white man architype is so common that we need three

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,760
people to play the same person.

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
Which one is -- anyway.

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,720
When we see someone who doesn't fit that, doesn't look like these three men, we assume

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,600
that they're not a real programmer because that is what a real programmer looks like.

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,260
Almost all the women in this industry I know have a story about somebody assuming that

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,470
they're not actually a programmer.

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,320
I've talked with multiple women here at PyCon this year, who have been asked which guy they're

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,010
here with.

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:53,420
The only reason they would come is because their partner, the man, is the programmer.

00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,000
If you're a dude has anyone every asked you that?

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,780
On the other hands, when you saw me get up on stage I do look like those guys.

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,420
So you probably assumed I was a real programmer.

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,360
These sorts of assumptions about what makes a real programmer contribute to the marginalized

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,820
people in tech.

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,730
All these numbers come from NCWIT, I'm going to forget the acronym, you can Google it,

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,040
they do a report on the state of women in technology.

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,800
National Center for women in technology, I think that's it.

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,860
Half of women with CS degrees are not employed in industries using those degrees.

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:43,520
40% of women leave technology within ten years compared to 17% of men.

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,720
Over half of women leave the industry at the mid point of their careers.

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,000
Certainly other causes.

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,650
I don't want to imply that this is a problem that -- with only one root cause.

00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,260
But imagine how frustrating it has to be to be woman with a decade of experience have

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,540
someone assume that you don't know what you're talking about.

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,190
It's going to take serious effort to fix our diversity problem.

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,260
We're never going to get there.

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,070
We're never going to solve this program if we can't figure out a more nuanced way to

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,370
think about what a programmer really is.

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,040
And what programming skills really are.

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,260
There are all kinds of runners, sprinters and distance runners and marathoners and you

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,309
will that marathoners and people who run on the weekends and people who run every day.

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,120
And people who run professionally.

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,470
And those who are dilettantes.

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,570
There are runners of all sizes and shapes and genders and ages and races.

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,860
All of them have different metrics for success you, all of them are capable of being successful

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,330
by their own metrics.

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:55,510
We have got to find such a nuanced shaded, interesting way of thinking about skill in

00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,510
tech.

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,280
I'm going to close with one more story.

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,950
This talk started as a conversation I had with Lynn root at PyCon some years ago it

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,250
planted the germ of an idea in my head that grew into this topic and eventually this talk.

00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:16,420
Lynn is a programmer, she is founder of the San Francisco chapter of PyLadies.

00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,200
She was one of last night's auctioneers.

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,299
She's a PSF board member.

00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:25,870
She's been in and around this community for awhile.

00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,740
At the time PyLadies was relatively new.

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:35,000
I was excited about just the energy and excitement and the people and the skills that that group

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,500
was bringing into the industry and I said to Lynn something along the lines of, you

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,370
know, it's so great to see all of these bad ass women programmers.

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,580
And Lynn said, yes, that's true.

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:58,910
But, we'll know we've been successful when there are whole bunch of average women programmers.

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:08,740
[Applause] The myths we tell ourselves about talent in

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,330
programming sets an impossibly high bar for entry.

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,680
The fact that any of us are here at all is kind of shocking given this myth.

00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,460
We need to dismantle it, we need to build a community where we recognize that average

00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,840
is actually pretty awesome.

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,711
So, I'm a mediocre program I would like to invite to you join me and together we can

00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:34,429
do our jobs perfectly adequately.

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:50,710
[Applause] [ Cheers and applause ]

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:58,850
All right.

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:06,990
Thank you.

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:19,030
So I can take questions, a few of them.

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:25,280
Before we do, just observation about questions that I've seen throughout this week.

00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,250
There's been a pattern of people who get up and use the time not to ask a question but

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,919
to share their opinion or to pontificate on what the speaker has said.

00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,840
[Applause] I am very personally interested in that, I

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,360
would like to personally hear that type of feedback I invite you to e-mail it to me or

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
tweet it at me.

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,470
But my experience sitting in the audience during those types of non-questions is frustration

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,620
and anger.

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,650
So I'd like to please ask people to ask questions.

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,429
Thank you.

00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:02,550
[Applause] >> Audience: Thank you very much for this

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,760
amazing talk I think it's really helpful.

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,700
I would like to get your opinion about another community I'm involved in, that I would like

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:24,840
to know if you know some security expert how average people like if security is also an

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,430
applicable field for average people or is that like reserved to Ninja and rock star?

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,090
>> If we think we have this problem in the programming community you don't know the security

00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,590
community.

00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,420
There's a reason that I attend and speak at programming conferences not security conferences.

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,160
It's even worse.

00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Yes.

00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,520
That problem exists in that community and, yes, there are plenty of perfectly average

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,830
security people as well.

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,870
But they set -- tell themselves this myth to an even higher degree.

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,450
And it is even more difficult for people entering those communities.

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,710
I wish that I could give this talk at a security conference but they probably wouldn't have

00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,450
it.

00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:10,630
>> Audience: I'm also a mediocre programmer.

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,630
>> Hi!

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,850
>> Audience: How do you think the idea of expertise or depth intersects with this dimension

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:22,429
of full stack or breadth because there's also this expectation of not only are you expert

00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:30,450
or not but you are generalist or specialist -- how do those combine in good or bad ways?

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,570
>> Yeah.

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:37,950
That's part of the myth, right, that you have to be broad and deep which you have to know

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,350
everything about everything, is that possible?

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,520
I think this is again one of these situations where we need a more nuanced understanding

00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
of skill.

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,409
Some people -- I'll brag a little bit, the thing that I'm good at is knowing a little

00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:53,650
bit about a lot of things.

00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,039
I'm not good at going deep or understanding lots of things, but I'm -- understanding the

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,429
details of a thing but I'm very good at understanding a lot of little pieces.

00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:09,600
We need to understand that that itself is a skill along with people who go on the other

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,120
Axis who wants to go the other way.

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,700
These are both complementary, if you're looking organizationally you want both of those types

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,920
of expertise.

00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Right?

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,450
I think that that is part of that myth that you have to somehow impossibly know everything

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,020
about everything.

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,679
>> Hi, thanks for your talk.

00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,919
Obviously it's something I've put a lot of thought into myself.

00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,590
I'm wondering, people in this room are probably aware of this problem particularly because

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,330
Python community is good about talking about it.

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:50,210
But what is it that we can do to help get rid of this myth back at our workplaces so

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,299
that recruiters and venture capitalists and people who are actually determining who gets

00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:02,350
brought into the community those first threshold are actually going to be aware that this is

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,940
something that's going on?

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,799
[Applause] >> I think that's an incredibly difficult

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,780
question there's probably about 30 answers.

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,510
I'll give the first one that comes to mind, I think there is more than this.

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,110
I think a lot about work-life balance.

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,660
I think a lot about the idea of the 40-hour or 35-hour work week.

00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,280
Because we seem to think, I think it's related to these myths, that we need to be working

00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,220
these crazy 60-hour weeks.

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,980
I think that's not true.

00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,330
I think that's part of our -- thank you.

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:49,900
I think that's related to this myth, I think one thing that we can do, especially those

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:56,140
of us who are -- do have a lot of privilege, who are well employed, who do have a one and

00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:03,309
half million person skill gap out there, if our companies don't respect the idea of work-life

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:09,230
balance and don't work the idea that doing your job -- that we should be able to do our

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:15,819
jobs well, adequately, should be able to deliver to expectations.

00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:20,159
And that should be -- that should be commended and that working a healthy schedule should

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,419
be commended I think it's endemic on us with the privilege to do so, to push our organizations

00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:30,589
to recognize and allow that to flourish.

00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:34,359
>> Thank you.

00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:40,049
[Applause] >> Audience: I'm Pamela and I'm a mediocre

00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:41,999
programmer as well.

00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:42,999
>> Hi.

00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,000
>> Audience: The other side that have question.

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,999
How do we get people who are mediocre programmers to get the courage to apply when we have a

00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:54,319
job opening?

00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:57,200
>> I wish I knew the answer to that.

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:05,609
I am personally hiring an intern this summer because I'm terrified, I don't know what to

00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:11,670
do to create a healthy environment for someone just entering, I think I know but I'm terrified

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,670
that I don't.

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,729
And I'm experimenting on somebody's career here.

00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:21,099
[ laughter ] If you have suggestions for me, please let

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,519
me know.

00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:30,849
>> Audience: Thanks.

00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:31,950
>> Thank you all again.

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,790
Everyone, the next things are downstairs in what was formerly the expo hall.

00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,869
It's now the job fair and poster session.

00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:41,249
Thanks again.

00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:42,249
Have a good rest of your day.

00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:42,250
