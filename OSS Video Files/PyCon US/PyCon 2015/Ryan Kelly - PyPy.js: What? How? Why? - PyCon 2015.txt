	"Speaker: Ryan Kelly

PyPy.js is an experiment in building a fast and compliant in-browser python interpreter, by compiling PyPy into javascript and retargeting its JIT to emit javascript code at runtime. This talk will demonstrate the combination of technologies that make such a thing possible, the results achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when taking python onto javascript's home turf.
