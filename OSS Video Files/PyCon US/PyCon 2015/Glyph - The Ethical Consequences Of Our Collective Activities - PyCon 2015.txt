Title: Glyph - The Ethical Consequences Of Our Collective Activities - PyCon 2015
Publication date: 2015-04-12
Playlist: PyCon 2015
Description: 
	"Speaker: Glyph

As more of the world is controlled by software, software developers have an increasing obligation to serve that world well.  Yet, we don't yet have a sense of what makes a good ethical standard.  The fast pace, success, and youth (in both historical and demographic terms) of our industry have given us the sense that such a standard might not be required.  This talk will correct that misconception.

so welcome to the first talk of this

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,670
session presenting right now will be

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,460
Glyph who's a longtime member of the

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,880
Python community has done a lot with

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,770
twisted and he will be here to talk

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,109
about the ethical consequences of our

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,500
collective activities he will be having

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,060
an open space afterwards so probably

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,090
will will not have time for questions

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,470
he's got a lot to tell us so if your

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,470
attention please to glyph thank you

00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,420
thanks everybody everybody can hear me

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,280
okay all right well so uh I'm I'm glyph

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,739
I'm the author of a lot of open source

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,510
software and I'm here today to start a

00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,610
conversation about what ethical

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,190
obligations we have as software

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,600
developers that's my twitter handle if

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,010
you want to follow me for all the latest

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,850
thoughts and ideas if you think that

00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:02,710
this talk is good so let's get started

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,390
down at PyCon and as at most technical

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,100
conferences most of the talks tell you

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,420
something about how you can get

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,250
something done with software what the

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,170
software can do for you

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,320
in this talk I'm not going to do

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,340
anything for you this is a talk about

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,259
obligations and I'm not even going to

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,530
tell you what you have to do I'm gonna

00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:22,539
ask you what you think we should do so I

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,210
strongly believe that software

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:27,330
developers need some agreed-upon ethical

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,850
principles for the creation of software

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,190
so why do I think that when we write

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,000
some software pretty much by definition

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,530
it's going to act on behalf of a user

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,020
and most of the time that user isn't

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,209
just ourselves when the user runs a

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,399
program that's an act of trust they're

00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,990
trusting us that it does what it says

00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,030
that we'll use whatever data they

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,500
provide to it to do what we claim it

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,050
does and so all software is written for

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,450
some user that software should serve

00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,340
that user when users place their faith

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,289
in our programs they're placing their

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,520
faith in us and we should take care to

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,239
see that that trust is not with

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
misplaced software is also the most

00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,560
complex artifact that humankind has ever

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,630
produced and any moderately sized

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,120
software system there will be billions

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,459
of changing pieces interacting all the

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,770
time new pieces new data structures new

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,390
functions new objects coming into

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,790
existence and disappearing all the time

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,800
that's just on one computer not on the

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,510
internet so this means that when we try

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,330
to make a system serve users we're

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,150
definitely going to fail at that simply

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,770
put all systems have bugs

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,590
so since even our best efforts are not

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,620
good enough any effort that we divert to

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,670
other concerns besides the users intent

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,010
constitutes a betrayal of that user

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,730
we're volunteering to add more bugs

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,220
without a

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,230
any benefit for them doctors have this

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,940
principle of first do no harm

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,560
medical ethics are much more complicated

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,049
than just that statement but this is a

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,400
very strong guiding principle and it

00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:59,409
overrides pretty much everything else

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,940
and the rest of this talk I'm going to

00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,069
discuss lots of different aspects of a

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,360
code of professional ethics but this is

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,030
the main point I want you to take away

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,569
above all our responsibility is to serve

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,610
the user this raises is an important and

00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,829
surprisingly complex question though who

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,329
is the user if you're making an

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,220
advertising driven website with some

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,010
content on it you actually have three

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,890
users one is the reader of the site

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,709
sometimes it's the writer of the content

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,000
and sometimes it's the advertiser and

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,760
understanding who your code is intended

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,319
to serve and what their intent is is an

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,129
important prerequisite to figuring out

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,530
how to serve them I also want to be

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,030
clear that professional ethics this code

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,950
that I'm proposing is not a code for

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,970
living your whole life I'm not going to

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,799
tell you what you need to do to be a

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,930
good person it's possible to be a

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,790
totally ethical software developer or

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,859
ethical lawyer or ethical doctor and

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,150
still be a terrible person in the rest

00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:56,950
of your life so the ethics of a

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,720
profession also don't encompass all of

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,519
the ethics surrounding that profession

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,470
like the ethics of banking or business

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,690
or government lots of other factors

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,190
dictate what programs you should be

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,680
building or who you should be building

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,209
them for I want to talk about once

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,130
you've decided I'm gonna write a program

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,459
it's gonna be for this person then what

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,320
do you do so ethical guidelines tell you

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,940
what behavior is expected of you as you

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,410
practice your profession and it's

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,380
important to limit this death scope

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,970
because reasonable people disagree we

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,349
love to talk about diversity in the

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,330
Python community and we usually talk

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,550
about the nice happy fuzzy things about

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,289
having a diverse community and loving

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,789
each other and all that great stuff but

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,440
the real truth of diversity we're the

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,389
hard work to get that community of

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,889
people who love each other comes in is

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,539
that you get people from different value

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,789
systems different political affiliations

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:44,740
different religions which means that you

00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,240
are going to hold some beliefs which

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,270
other software developers are going to

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,160
think are evil and vice versa if we're

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,500
gonna have a universally enforceable

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,180
code of conduct code of ethics it needs

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,849
to be something that Universal eise's

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,839
that is not specific to any particular

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:03,639
definition of good or evil so if in some

00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,110
hypothetical scenario you're writing the

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,089
guidance system for a bomb that's gonna

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,559
kill a million people you have an

00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,179
ethical problem that it goes beyond the

00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,979
scope of what it means to be a good

00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,839
software developer the solution in that

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,249
situation has nothing to do with the

00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,779
ethical challenges of writing software

00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,159
and everything to do with the ethical

00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:20,349
challenges related to building huge

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,849
bombs and as we did develop a code of

00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:23,589
ethics it's important not to drag in

00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:27,219
these dramatic but ultimately irrelevant

00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,689
examples to that discussion so software

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:30,939
development has been around for quite a

00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,909
while someone else must have given this

00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,769
some thought before and as it happens

00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,869
professional engineering societies like

00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:39,789
the I Triple E the Institute of

00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:41,679
Electrical and Electronics Engineers and

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,619
the Association for Computing Machinery

00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:46,029
have both specified ethical codes which

00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:49,509
all of their members are signatory to

00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:51,849
but these codes are at best a really

00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:53,319
rough draft the first indication that

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,969
these codes might not be sufficient is

00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,110
that not many software development

00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,029
professionals are actually members of

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,399
them this is where you'll have a great

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,649
opportunity to embarrass me on stage how

00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:07,719
many of you are members of one of these

00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:10,329
organizations I see maybe four hands I

00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:13,259
think six there's more than six people

00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:15,339
in the audience though so the average

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,959
software developer is not a part of

00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,079
those organizations and therefore

00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,490
doesn't sign on to those codes of ethics

00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,839
another indication that it might not be

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,849
quite sufficient is that it's really

00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,469
really short the New York lawyers code

00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,050
of Professional Responsibility weighs in

00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,269
at 77 pages and this is just the

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,069
official code itself not the mandatory

00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:35,379
training classes that you need to take

00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:38,349
in law school and all of the symposia on

00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:42,159
legal ethics that they have whereas the

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:44,079
ACMs code is seven pages the most

00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,759
important part of an ethical code in my

00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,199
mind is the parts that give us clear

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,409
ways to think about our apparently

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,939
conflicting responsibilities a lawyer

00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,589
has responsibilities both to the court

00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,459
and to their clients and the guidance

00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,029
about the scope of those

00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,860
responsibilities is extremely specific

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,110
by contrast the first two principal of

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,610
the ACMs code of ethics are software

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,069
engineers shall act consistently with

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,329
the Public Interest software engineers

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,529
shall act in a manner that is in the

00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,120
best interest of their client and

00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,060
employer and consistent with the public

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,320
interest

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,090
but that doesn't give us any good

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,710
guidance on what exactly the scope of

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,150
the responsibility of the Public

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,440
Interest is what about when the

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,750
interests of our employers are not

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,130
Congre with the public interest who gets

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,770
to decide what is and is not in the

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,669
public interest furthermore who exactly

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,560
is the public

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,660
this is furthermore exemplified later in

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,000
the code where it says strive for high

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,570
quality acceptable cost and a reasonable

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,430
schedule if you're familiar with the

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,780
project management concept of the Iron

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,180
Triangle you know that this is

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,980
impossible the code does go on to hedge

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,840
and say some stuff about trade-offs and

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,940
informing the customer but the I Triple

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,650
E and ACM don't tell us when to say no

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,229
they don't tell us what's really out of

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,610
scope so this talk is about the ethical

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,540
consequences of our collective

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,360
activities so let me talk about

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,250
consequences right now the software

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,139
industry is doing great Society loves

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,060
programmers software's changing the

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,139
world changing live software is eating

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,669
the world it's making the impossible

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:08,060
possible we're all just having a great

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,220
time but this can't last sooner or later

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,419
in the absence of any standard for

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,250
ethical judgment somebody's going to

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,500
write some code that they think is fine

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,570
but seriously impacts the lives of

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,130
millions of people some application is

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,860
going to grievously and irreversibly

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,940
betray all of its users a security

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,530
breach is going to have some more

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,820
serious consequence than resetting all

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,370
of your passwords for the fourth time

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,810
this week Society will turn on software

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,450
developers and it will be our own fault

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,430
in the ensuing robot apocalypse one of

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,289
two things will happen even the machines

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,849
will win and completely unconstrained

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,280
software will take over the planet which

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,080
might look like this or alternatively

00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,000
the users will win against our machine

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,470
overlords throwing off the shackles of

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,210
software technology but in the process

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,800
abandon everything about modern

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,440
civilization that is made possible by

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,980
software which instead might look

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,330
something like this I hope you'll agree

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,700
with me that neither of these outcomes

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,589
seemed too appealing artistic black and

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,680
white composition and tack sharp subject

00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:04,880
focus notwithstanding when the software

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,589
goes off the rails it does something

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,200
really bad we need to be prepared with a

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:11,300
story as to why that bad thing broke the

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,589
rules how it isn't normal and we can't

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,600
just expect software developers to go

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,220
off and do that again we need to explain

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,110
to society why they can trust us as a

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,510
group in general even when some of us

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,280
screw up sometimes rebuilding trust

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,170
after the robot apocalypse will be tough

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,360
but it'll be tougher if they just think

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,649
we're going to do it

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,290
the catastrophe might not be so obvious

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,029
though more realistic than a robot

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,070
apocalypse is a bunch of really terrible

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,690
legislation that prevents innovation in

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,149
key areas written by people who don't

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,760
know what software is because we fail to

00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,170
write our own rules that made sense

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,430
these laws are coming and the only thing

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,660
that we get to do is decide whether

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,060
we're gonna be in the room when they get

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,300
made some of these laws are already here

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,279
in the USA we already have great laws

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,380
like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act a

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,990
law literally based on a science fiction

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,850
movie about a robot apocalypse because

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,029
that's what legislators thought software

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,770
was going to do a number of other

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,390
professions have specific ethical codes

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,649
professions that have such codes and

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,589
expect their members to adhere to them

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:11,600
strictly have a few things in common one

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,339
thing is that they that those codes may

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,930
be counterintuitive and may require

00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,610
their adherents to do things that seem a

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,700
little morally questionable or might be

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,620
wrong in other circumstances medicine

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,779
law and journalism each has a specific

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,640
code of ethics and specific laws

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,899
associated with that code and dedicates

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,190
at least some of its time as a

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:32,660
profession to discussing those ethics

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,760
each of those professions has three

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,440
broad categories of ethical obligation

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,300
as well they almost all have an

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,190
obligation of service obligation of

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,620
transparency and an obligation of

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,060
secrecy you have to do things for people

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,350
there are certain things you have to

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,320
tell people and there are certain things

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,520
you can't tell people I'll tell you

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,660
three quick stories to illustrate these

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,520
doctors are obliged to care for their

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,500
patients and not to harm their patients

00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,209
this is true no matter how horrible

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,620
their patients are and no matter how

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,870
their patients came to be in their care

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,579
if a mass-murderer shows up in the

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,200
emergency room bleeding from a

00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,880
self-inflicted wound caused by their own

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,070
stupidity a doctor is nevertheless

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,270
obliged to treat that wound it is not

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,070
the doctors place to judge their

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,230
patients no matter how obvious the

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,240
judgment appears to be this is legally

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,200
referred to as the duty of care and is

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,130
related to the concept of do no harm

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,170
doctors are not allowed to tell people

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,760
what you tell them in general the

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,680
information that you provide to them is

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
used only for your care and even the

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,640
police can't compel them to relay it

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,579
without a court order there are specific

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,960
examples which break this rule but all

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,990
of those exceptions have been hammered

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,850
over time doctors are also obliged to

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,290
meet certain standards when it comes to

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,550
informing their patients about treatment

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,500
options there are certain things they

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,360
have to tell you it's not enough just to

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,070
tell you though they have to make sure

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,100
the patient understands well enough to

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,180
make an informed decision

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,650
lawyers are obliged to zealously

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,750
represent their clients even if their

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,980
clients are really bad people when the

00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,750
doctor is done patching up that

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,300
mass-murderer and it's time for their

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:06,050
day in court their lawyer is required to

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,250
enthusiastically defend them that also

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,930
means they have to do whatever they can

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,490
to advocate for them in court get them

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,990
to light a sentence regardless of how

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,420
objectionable the lawyer might find

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,710
their client lawyers also aren't allowed

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,000
to use any of the information that they

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,830
received from clients except in the

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
clients interest almost everything that

00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,890
you tell a lawyer in the course of

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,330
planning your defense is protected and

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,060
the lawyers forbidden from telling the

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,710
police lawyers are officers of the court

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,330
however which means they have certain

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,070
obligations where they have to disclose

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,950
information that might harm their

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,770
clients case for example the ethical

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,740
concept of adverse Authority means that

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,750
in certain specific cases a lawyer may

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,460
be obligated to remind the court of a

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,050
legal decision or law that is against

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,760
the client their clients interests if

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,830
the opposing counsel doesn't bring it up

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,980
there are precise rules around when this

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,090
is and isn't required though journalists

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,070
have to tell the truth to a higher

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,630
standard than most of us have to they're

00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,250
not allowed to lie even if they strongly

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,250
believe lying will advance the social

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,330
good so let's say our mass murderer is

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,500
in the middle there trial and the

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,450
journalist starts looking into the

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,830
claims of their heinous crimes even if

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,560
the claims seem totally plausible

00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,960
everybody knows it's true they still

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,750
have to investigate beyond just the

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,980
seeming credibility and actually it

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,360
turns out that our hypothetical mass

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,980
murderer didn't actually kill all those

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
people after all they were set up by a

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,890
paramilitary group that's their

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,420
political enemies which was also the

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,160
source of that wound they had it wasn't

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,540
their own mistake why did you even

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,920
believe me when I told you that they

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,050
were a mass murderer in the previous two

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,670
examples it's a good thing that our

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,820
hypothetical journalist is more ethical

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,710
than all of you

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,660
so the journalist also has an obligation

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,430
to protect the identity identities of

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,870
their confidential sources and in many

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,640
areas they have some level of legal

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,660
privilege related to protecting those

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,760
identities they can't in many cases be

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,050
forced by the police to reveal sources

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
again there are exceptions to this rule

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,830
but they're all pretty specific

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,110
journalists also have an obligation of

00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,220
transparency to disclose any conflict of

00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,690
interest that they might have any

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,280
financial interest in the stories that

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,450
they're covering and generally avoid

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,690
covering those stories where they have

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,160
an interest at all in all of these cases

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,230
these professions have codes of ethics

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,020
in part because we need to submit to

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,910
their expertise in the case of a doctor

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,010
we allow them to do painful sometimes

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,080
apparently damaging things to us like

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,370
surgery on the understanding that they

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,730
know that these harmful things are going

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,710
to help us better than we do and even if

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,050
we can't fully understand how they're

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,490
going to help us in the case of a lawyer

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,800
we submit to their knowledge of the law

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,630
and entrust them with our money business

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,560
and sometimes our freedom on the

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,930
understanding that they'll use that

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,430
knowledge to work on our behalf and in

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,930
case of the journalists we have to

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,790
believe what they say because we simply

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,090
don't have the time to go investigate

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,110
every claim on our own every one of

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,700
these professions comes with the

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,940
tremendous possibility of abuse over

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,710
time in order to try to prevent that

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,630
abuse the professions themselves have

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,400
created codes of ethics and ways

00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,470
enforcing those codes and society has

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,960
created laws protecting the exercise of

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,610
those ethics as the creators and

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,320
operators of software we enjoy a

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,330
similarly trusted relationship with the

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,920
public they give our software their

00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,710
personal information their credit card

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,880
numbers their time their energy all on

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,470
the understanding that we've done the

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,650
best to make the software do what

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,690
they're telling it to do so let's talk

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,160
about our obligations we probably have

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,840
some obligation of service some

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,540
obligation of transparency and some

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,540
obligation of secrecy so what's your

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,710
obligation of service look like one of

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,780
the cool things about my current

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,910
employer Rackspace is the concept of

00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,260
fanatical support now I don't want to

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,000
turn this into a Rackspace commercial

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,950
don't worry but I think that the notion

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,020
of fanatical support is a good template

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,640
to build an obligation of service for

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,220
software developers on the idea of

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,750
fanatical support is that you're always

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,640
enthusiastically actively asking what's

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,190
the best for the customer what can I do

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,950
to best support them everything else is

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,840
supposed to be secondary knowing exactly

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,700
what best serves the user is really hard

00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,110
it's actually harder for a software

00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,220
developer than a support person because

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,650
with a support person you could at least

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,060
ask with a with software you have to

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,360
kind of project the needs of the user

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,010
into the future

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,380
if you take that question what serves

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,850
the user and always put that first you

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,730
have a sort of razor you can use to

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,600
start making tough decisions then

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,360
there's a question of what our

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,279
obligation of secrecy is there's an

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
obvious one most other professions have

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,269
a passive obligation of secrecy don't

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,399
disclose information and I think we

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,649
share that in our increasingly networked

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,360
world it's increasingly common to come

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,920
in the possession of users personal

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,350
information the course of developing or

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,060
monitoring software and we should of

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,760
course keep that secret I think that's

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,610
pretty well understood I think we do

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,260
have a bonus obligation though an active

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,149
obligation of secrecy that a lot of

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,529
other professions don't have we have to

00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,750
write our software in such a way that it

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:47,010
doesn't share users information

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,839
inadvertently with anyone else or even

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,570
with us and this can be a tricky

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,490
obligation because information security

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,519
is a complex and challenging field full

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,420
of impossibly baroque technology and

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,790
surprising and counterintuitive behavior

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,880
I think there's like six talks just at

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,530
this conference about how bad TLS is you

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,329
can ask any maintainer of the Python

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,949
cryptographic Authority how happy they

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,780
are with their life choices and you'll

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,380
see what I mean

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,780
so how much security is a waste of money

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,329
right you can pour as much time and

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,610
money as you want into it and how little

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,549
is irresponsibly risking your users

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,870
safety how much is just right we need to

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,540
figure that out and I don't think that

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,350
there's a good understanding of that yet

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,169
and then there's a question of what

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,240
obligations we have to be transparent

00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:35,100
one I hope relatively non-controversial

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,270
obligation of transparency is that we

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,299
should have an obligation to disclose

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,070
known bugs users who might be affected

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,960
by a problem with the software should be

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,400
informed about how to avoid the problem

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,970
if we know that the problem is there

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,690
already

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,309
in my ideal world we would actually have

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,260
an ethical obligation beyond that to

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,669
always ship source to everything so the

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,260
users can tell how it works and

00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:57,630
understand what the software is doing on

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,880
their behalf now note that this is not

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,380
the same thing as open source open

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,809
source is to do with how the code is

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,429
licensed and what rights you have to

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:06,630
modify it and redistribute it I'm

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,970
talking about a much more limited

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,970
obligation just to show users how the

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,530
software works I'm also interested in

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,090
copyright reform but that's a whole

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,549
separate topic and probably a separate

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,889
conference

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,480
beyond a separate talk but I realized

00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:22,509
that source availability would be

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,340
considered somewhat extreme by many in

00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:26,230
the industry but one question I'd like

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,909
everyone to think about is if the source

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,649
codes already protected by copyright law

00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:31,360
what is it that we're doing by

00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:35,080
obfuscating it before we give it to our

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,669
customers what do we have to hide the

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,440
success of Python we're shipping source

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:40,690
code is the default and you get the P

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,220
wise along with the py CS is kind of an

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,570
interesting indication that this might

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,450
not be as bad as the rest of the

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,980
industry thinks even if we could agree

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,299
on all of the obligations that I just

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,999
proposed though the next step in

00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:55,509
developing a code of ethics is with real

00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:56,830
teeth is social recognition each of

00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,409
these other professions I've mentioned

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,989
have specific laws that recognize

00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:03,220
details of their specific obligations I

00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,499
mentioned this one because there is a

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,480
persistent and dangerously wrong meme in

00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:11,019
the software development community that

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,820
you can somehow hack the law what I mean

00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,759
by hack the law is to discover a

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,379
specific legal interpretation discover a

00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,690
clever way to turn it on itself and then

00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:21,460
consider a problem solved here we have

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,899
one of my favorite xkcd comics where we

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,700
can see an insurance agent interacting

00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,049
with a programmer the programmer thinks

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,960
they've discovered something clever and

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,850
the agent interrupts and here's the part

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,230
explaining that the cool hack you just

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,029
thought of is called insurance fraud

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,820
we've already thought about it

00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:38,139
and we know that it's a crime I think

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,749
most of us can see ourselves just a

00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:42,549
little bit in that comic one of the laws

00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:45,009
that we keep trying to hack is copyright

00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,929
law and the persistent failure of

00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,249
copyleft licenses is the strongest

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:50,739
evidence that trying to solve social

00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:53,289
problems by hacking the law or society

00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:55,269
doesn't work and yes I said persistent

00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:56,619
failure of copyleft because I was

00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:59,499
worried that people wouldn't be mad

00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:01,269
enough at me by the end of the talk so

00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:03,129
the origin of copyleft licenses begins

00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:04,989
the value judgment that the soft that

00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:06,580
freedom of software is important that

00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:07,869
users should demand it and that

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,499
copyright law taken to its logical

00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:13,059
extension is terrifying and dystopian

00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:15,609
much of the canoe manifesto sums up to

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,200
this statement which is in it users will

00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:18,669
no longer be at the mercy of one

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
programmer or company who owns the

00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:23,950
sources of course there are other things

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,409
that close source might keep us or might

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,450
might keep sorry there are other things

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,050
besides closed source which might keep

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,060
them at the MER

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,920
those companies but assuming that the

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,270
user of a free user modifiable operating

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,040
system is no longer at the mercy of

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,140
those programmers and when using a

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,170
proprietary OS is what did today does

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,940
today's breakdown look like how many

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,680
people are using a free and user

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,810
modifiable desktop operating system

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,670
thirty years into the canoe project not

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,290
very many now this is not to say the

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,050
canoe hasn't achieved anything I don't

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,910
want you to be that mad at me they have

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,310
provided a rock-solid basis for many

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,870
server-side systems many of which are

00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,970
now things that Richard Stallman rants

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,740
about they've just failed in their

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,390
original objective which was to preserve

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,480
the freedom of users to modify their

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,570
systems the originators of the free

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,480
software movement who are famous for

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,310
their somewhat idiosyncratic people

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,380
skills thought that they could fix this

00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,450
problem with a cool hack what they

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,160
objected to was that copyright licensing

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,440
terms effectively let their ideological

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,270
opponents write their own laws canoe

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,930
hacked this system by creating copyright

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,280
or copyleft licenses effect in effect

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,320
restrictive laws more in line with their

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,150
own ideological perspective rather than

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,460
that of their opponents this was a

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,830
legitimately brilliant idea I'm not

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,540
knocking it from that perspective and it

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,640
might well have worked and you know

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,380
arguably in some ways is working as part

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,150
of a broader strategy that involved much

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,370
more public participation outreach

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,890
partnerships with industry and practical

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,020
compromises the reason that the strategy

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,790
has by and large not worked is that laws

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,980
and ethical codes for that matter are

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,020
not precisely executed uniformly

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,760
enforced systems that you can just

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,890
change a rule and have it magically do

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,380
what you want laws are made interpreted

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,580
and enforced by real live people and so

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,830
if you don't have the majority of people

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,240
on your side at some level fancy

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,910
contracts shenanigans are not going to

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,730
help you so let's say we all agree as

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,560
software developers that we need such a

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,360
code and let's say this code comes with

00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,340
for example an obligation to Disco's

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,870
disclose bugs to our users just like a

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,160
doctor would have a responsibility to

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,170
tell patients about treatment options

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,300
even if the drug companies would prefer

00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,070
not one of the things that makes for

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,840
such an obligation is the legal

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,780
protection against retaliation when you

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,520
honor that obligation these protections

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,050
the privileges or shields that I

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,820
mentioned before doctor-patient

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,110
privilege legal professional privilege

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,370
journalistic shield laws all

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,080
rise from the general public's

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,150
understanding of the role and the

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,520
various legislators acting upon that

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,240
understanding so while we should be

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,370
reflecting on our collective

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,690
responsibilities in acting in an ethical

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,910
way for the sake of our own consciences

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,140
we also need to make sure we're trying

00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,420
to communicate that to the rest of

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,970
society of course if we're gonna try to

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,960
reach out to the broader public there's

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,610
only so much we can do

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,049
communication requires the attention of

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,000
the listener just as much as it requires

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:09,860
the words of the speaker so how do we

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,900
how much of teaching the public both

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,790
about the need for ethical standards and

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,650
about the way that our software works is

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,120
our responsibility and how much is their

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,730
responsibility do we have an obligation

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,080
to teach people to program it might be

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,190
helpful at this point to examine the

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,630
ethical standards of a different

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,960
profession one that I haven't mentioned

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,000
yet described at one point in history

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,980
literacy was a highly specialized skill

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,450
for most of recorded human history in

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,770
fact only a small fraction of the

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,140
population could actually do the

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,669
recording of history so scribes had

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,860
ethical rules as well there were rules

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:42,500
of craftsmanship for poetry rules of

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,790
accuracy for accounting and so on and so

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,580
on for all the things you might want to

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,950
write down however with the advent of

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,540
nearly Universal literacy the need for a

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,450
separate specialized profession of

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,309
writers went away those of us who work

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,570
in software as a profession do have some

00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,130
specialized knowledge which will

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,320
probably never be part of a general

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,570
curriculum distributed coordination

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,370
techniques cryptographic algorithms

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,440
low-level operating system interfaces

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,580
they all take us long enough to learn

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,900
and get good at that it's hard to

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,990
imagine them becoming general

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,240
requirements that said the basics of

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,370
functions variables data types modules

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,190
and so on are sufficiently basic that we

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,630
can and routinely do for example at this

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,520
conference teach them to young children

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,440
and thereby enable them to do pretty

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,980
cool stuff so if an eight-year-old can

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,929
do it in a tower seminar we could maybe

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,070
imagine that adults in our society could

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:36,200
manage it as well the CV for a project

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,460
computer programming for everyone is one

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,309
of the things that drew me to Python in

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,630
the first place well I'm not sure that

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:43,640
we have an obligation to teach people

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,840
programming one way that we might be

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,540
able to reduce the burden on ourselves

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,919
to have a strictly enforced code where

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,720
we have to be faithful agents of the

00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,309
people who are trusting us might be to

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,780
empower our users to act as their own

00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,399
agents if they don't like what we're

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,649
doing

00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,330
in a society which already had universal

00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,799
programming literacy we might not need

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,109
to care so much about these problems at

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,099
all

00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,539
maybe if our legislators knew how to

00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:08,299
code they wouldn't produce terrible laws

00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,379
like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act if

00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,909
more people knew the basis of

00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:12,109
programming serious obligations might

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,519
only apply to more specialized

00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:15,440
programmers in the same way that

00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,469
journalists is a bit narrower of a field

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,119
than literate but ethical codes are

00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:21,379
specific to the context of a society

00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,700
they are designed to interact with and

00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:24,919
today we have society that largely

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,960
doesn't know how to code for example the

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,519
Hippocratic oath the original version of

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,419
the original code of professional ethics

00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:34,339
taken by doctors included this provision

00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:35,509
the modern version does not today we

00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:38,330
have a different system of medical

00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:39,469
education but in Hippocrates his time he

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,700
knee felt the need to include this

00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,929
provision to ensure that medical

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:49,219
knowledge would survive to future

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:50,599
generations today though this is the

00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,190
provision that the Declaration of Geneva

00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,559
a much more recently updated version of

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,940
the doctor's oath has a functioning

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,219
system of medical medical education

00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,839
arose it became less important and

00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,159
today's oath basically just says don't

00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,749
be a jerk to your teacher which is a

00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,330
little bit weaker of an obligation than

00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:08,629
teacher children's teachers children for

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,379
free forever as long as you're alive so

00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:12,200
on this topic

00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:13,969
the question I'll leave you with is in

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,289
or more is is our more important

00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,789
obligation to establish a code of

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,799
professional ethics for our elite

00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:20,119
profession or to popularize our

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,379
profession so that everyone can do it

00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,259
and it's a little less important to

00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:26,539
trust a small elite one opportunity that

00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:28,339
we have to educate our users either to

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,899
educate laypeople about programming or

00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,339
to educate other programmers about what

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:33,409
our libraries are doing for them is when

00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,210
they ask for help with our software one

00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:38,149
place we all get help asked for help a

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,119
lot is in the context of open source

00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:43,599
communities so this next bit is specific

00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,919
to open source and volunteer development

00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,999
one popular response to request for

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,669
support in the free software community

00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:52,669
when I've used many times in the past

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,109
myself is patches accepted of course if

00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:55,729
you're all young and hip you probably

00:26:54,109 --> 00:27:00,109
say this instead but what you really

00:26:55,729 --> 00:27:01,999
mean is when you say patch is accepted

00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:04,190
or RTFM or any one of a number of these

00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:06,950
catchphrases is you've got this code for

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,380
free I owe you nothing but it's worth

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,240
considering two things at this point

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,340
first of all if we have an obligation of

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,690
service to our users then if you don't

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,760
want to have users just don't make the

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,650
software once you've done it maybe you

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,420
actually owe them a little bit whether

00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:25,140
you did it for money or not it is for

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,640
the users but remember also that the

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,040
users gave you their attention in their

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,080
time when you're fielding these sorts of

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,880
support requests remember that if you've

00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,620
gotten a job offer good professional

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,020
connections how to fund conference

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,430
gotten some contracting work or just

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,780
even increased your reputation the

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,250
community which lets you command a

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,710
slightly higher salary from your

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,660
employer that this is in some small part

00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,850
due to each user paying attention to you

00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,470
this doesn't mean that we owe our users

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,940
every minute of our lives and all of our

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,430
spare attention and that users should be

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,780
super entitled but it does mean that we

00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,010
should be gracious for the support

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,630
they've given us and honest with them

00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,730
about the resources that we have to fix

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,110
it

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,660
are you writing this offer for your free

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,550
time just for fun do you intend to

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,890
earnestly support it what kind of bug

00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,440
fixes can users expect if you make bold

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,040
claims like it's performance and it's

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,540
robust

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,950
you're implicitly saying that users

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,700
should rely on you and put it into

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,440
production if you don't have the time to

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,300
work on an open-source tool sometimes

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,940
you just need to tell users thanks for

00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,310
your support but I don't have time to

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,800
work on this make it clear that you'll

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,240
hand it off to an interested maintainer

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,070
this is especially important if you say

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,570
pull requests accepted and you haven't

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,930
actually accepted a pull request in six

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,870
months so now that that's out there what

00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,950
do I actually expect you to do with it a

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,420
rigorously enforced code of ethics for

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,520
all software developers everywhere in

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,780
the world is a pretty tall order so may

00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,180
be the place to start is with in the

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,710
Python Software Foundation we have a

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,960
code of conduct which tells us how we

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,130
should treat each other perhaps we could

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,420
start working together on a code of

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,900
ethics that tells us how we're going to

00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,310
treat our users if we could start there

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,370
maybe we could set an example for other

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,930
communities so this talk has barely

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,290
scratched the surface of what we need to

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,690
do

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,520
I had an additional three hours of

00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,890
material that I had to cut to make time

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,630
so it would be inaccurate to say the end

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,190
on this slide but we've got an open

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,390
space coming up later where I would love

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,730
to discuss this with anybody who's

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,970
interested thank you very much for your

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,970
time

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:39,530
thank you as promised he filled all the

00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,150
time so it in ten minutes we will start

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,920
with the second session of this our

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,920
