all right everybody well it goes so

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:21,359
quickly doesn't it our three days here

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:25,830
together every year we are reaching the

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,130
end of the 2015 edition of the pike on

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:36,390
conference I have just a few final notes

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:39,840
and we will be complete first for anyone

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,930
who wants the conference does not have

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,190
to end the fun does not have to conclude

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,160
for four more days the Python Software

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,829
Foundation actually provides the venue

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,840
for us for four additional days so that

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,140
we can do a tradition that started in

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,579
the Python community now used in other

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,610
parts of open source called sprints open

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:10,020
source projects are most of the year

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,409
very distributed affairs with debates

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,320
happening on mailing lists on issues on

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,290
issue trackers they're called sprints

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,930
because projects find they can move so

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,610
quickly if everyone's in the same room

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,420
if everyone's in front of the same

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,000
whiteboard and Sprint's have evolved

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,270
over the years from simply being powwows

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,930
among the leaders of perhaps an open

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,640
source project to now being major

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,549
onboarding events where women and men

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,180
interested in helping out in learning

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,460
show up and write documentation write

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,350
code learn how to set up their machine

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,869
and check out source code for the very

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,180
first time if you are interested the

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,979
instructions are very simple just stay

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,479
in this room there'll be about 10

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,090
minutes when we let people take a

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,820
restroom break and and move out into the

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,640
hallways five or ten minutes be seated

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,439
back here and the sprint leaders will be

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,149
getting up and pitching their projects

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,670
to you if you're looking for something

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,000
to get involved in here these next four

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,040
days

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,700
few more days in Montreal thank you to

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,670
the sponsor Safari who made it possible

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,530
this year for us to do the closed

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,530
captioning and to try to make

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,060
and thank you to all of the captioners

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,590
who were working their fingers very hard

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,720
and during every single talk it was

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,390
already I've heard reports been making

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,000
Pikkon much more accessible for a number

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,710
of people but it was our first time it

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,990
was our first time through this process

00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,000
our volunteers were learning the process

00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,840
we would love to hear your feedback

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,370
positive and negative so we have a form

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,380
you can fill out if you have some

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,210
feedback for us because this is

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,670
something we are targeting to become a

00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:15,230
permanent part of Python and we'd love

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:17,480
to hear how it went there's the URL I am

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,530
supposed to announce and put up on the

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,080
screen the 5k run winners I get to

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,460
announce this year not only that a

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,580
single male winner won but that a pair

00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,520
of women reach the finish line neck and

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:40,690
neck and so congratulations to the three

00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,690
winners of our 5k Saturday run

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:59,330
and I'm impressed for everyone who got

00:03:52,050 --> 00:04:05,370
up that early all right next year is

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:09,180
2016 Brandon people say to me where will

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,540
PyCon be held so I have something to

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,540
show you

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,530
you

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,210
you

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,890
you

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,589
and my first Pikkon was at a forsaken

00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:49,309
conference hotel out by a hotel hair

00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:55,759
airport the only other restaurants were

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:59,300
other hotels it was awful I have been so

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,309
incredibly impressed seeing the

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,789
transformation that has taken place as

00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:08,869
the psf brought a dedicated event

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:12,199
planner on to the psf staff and I've

00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:14,629
been very very appreciative seeing havez

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,689
work is she has brought us places like

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:22,330
Montreal we're following that up by once

00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,330
again having Pikkon in an actual place

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:40,319
in in a real city and we are continuing

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,330
to work to make pycon not just a place

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,099
for the programmer that wants to sit in

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:49,110
a conference hotel but for somewhere

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,879
that you'll want to a destination that

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,789
you'll be happy you're visited that you

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,370
visited if you stay the day before or

00:07:53,789 --> 00:08:00,210
stay the day after or bring your family

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,849
with you we're going to portland in 2016

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,900
now as we've made this transition as

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:10,289
we've begin begun to arrange destination

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,780
pecans we are competing with a lot of

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:15,539
conferences that plan even further out

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,719
than the psf is able to we're working

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,759
every year to move out our planning so

00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:23,669
that we can get you to awesome places

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,120
with vibrant tech scenes like Montreal

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,159
like Portland but for 2016 it has

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,889
slightly bumped our date later in the

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,959
year 2017 we'll be back to the normal

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,140
schedule roughly where we are this year

00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:39,149
for 2017 it'll be a bit of a different

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,079
opportunity because it will be just

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:45,899
after the college year in the United

00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:48,060
States I cannot remember a pipe icon

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,180
where I haven't heard that somebody had

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,329
a test or an exam and was prevented from

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,949
attending so we're changing it up in

00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:03,510
2016 the tutorials will be Saturday and

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:06,390
Sunday over the weekend the talks will

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,779
then be Monday May thirtieth which is

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:12,570
memorial day Tuesday and Wednesday and

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,149
then the sprints will start on Thursday

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,920
jun 2nd a bit of a bump later in the

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,230
year we'll be able to start the program

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,810
selection at a slightly different date

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,820
and I'm excited to see the different mix

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,290
that's able to show up when we're not

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,079
hitting the middle of the school year

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,690
for all of our academics in the Python

00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,810
community then we'll be back more to the

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,480
Mesa to the this is May right is this

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,880
April yeah okay sorry then we'll be

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,840
moving back closer to the April May time

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:49,920
frame in 2017 Portland

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,920
is an incredible city culture craft beer

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,510
Powell's the world's largest independent

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,730
new and used bookstore the conference

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,890
center is is just up in the northeast

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,480
corner of the city we hope to get you

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,640
guys easy access to public

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,950
transportation to visit the city to

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,890
visit tech companies and to be able to

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,410
experience Portland there's natural

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:15,400
beauty nearby within an hour and a half

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:19,180
there's seashore and high mountains with

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,890
enclosed travel of the city but you know

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:29,680
for many of us there's more to Portland

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:34,390
than beauty culture and shopping we will

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:38,500
finally be fulfilling a dream a dream

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:42,370
that dates back to our childhood as we

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:48,190
SAT our face aglow with a light of the

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:52,050
CRT as we dreamed of reaching in safety

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,050
and good health the Willamette Valley of

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,050
Oregon

00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:09,129
when we dreamed of reaching the end of

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,129
the trail

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,810
we know that the way will not be easy

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,310
and that there may be losses to the

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,310
community along the way

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:40,509
but we will persevere and I hope to see

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:44,410
you next year in portland oregon there

00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:46,870
is no better way to end a pike on than

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,269
with thanks because a community

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:54,339
