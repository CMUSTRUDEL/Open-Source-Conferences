Description: 
	"Speaker: Colton Myers

Are you still using SSH to manage your servers? Deploying code manually with rsync? There’s a better way. SaltStack is one of the latest and greatest tools for system management. Once you have a foundation of lightning-fast remote execution, you can build anything on top of it. Plus, it’s written in Python, and easy to extend!

>> HELLO, EVERYBODY.

00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,359
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED KATHERINE'S TALK AND WE'RE MOVING ON TO MIRIAM LAUTER'S TALK ON MAKING

00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,359
YOUR OWN AIR CONDITIONER.

00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,989
THERE WILL BE A MODERATED Q AND A AT THE END SO

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,070
SAVE YOUR QUESTIONS AND THE MICROPHONE IS DEAD

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,070
CENTER.

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,070
OKAY.

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,210
THANK YOU.

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,979
[ Applause ] YOU WON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE WHOLE AIR CONDITIONER

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:13,979
YOURSELF.

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:14,979
THIS IS A VERY BIG ROOM.

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,479
PEOPLE IN THE BACK, I HAVE TO PRETEND YOU'RE NOT

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,159
HERE SO I DON'T PASS OUT.

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,960
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE IT'S MANAGED TO BE

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,479
A BALMY FEW DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING HERE IN MONDAY

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,630
TEMPORARILY AND YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT AIR CONDITIONING.

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,040
BUT IF YOU CAN THINK BACK TO WHAT IT'S LIKE OVER

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,459
THE SUMMER, I LIVE IN NEW YORK, IT GETS PRETTY MUGGY AND I WOULD COME HOME TO MY ROOM AND

00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:40,819
I WOULD MAKE A BEELINE FOR THE AIR CONDITIONER

00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,369
AND STAND THERE TRYING NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING,

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,060
AND FINALLY THE ROOM WOULD COOL DOWN AND I WOULD

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,079
GO TO BED AND THEN I WOULD WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,670
OF THE NIGHT FREEZING, AND I STARTED TO THINK

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,920
TO MYSELF, MAN, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,180
WAS SOME WAY TO HAVE YOUR AIR CONDITIONER SORT

00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,200
OF CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE ITSELF AND MAYBE YOU

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,649
COULD EVEN TURN IT ON BEFORE YOU GOT HOME, AND

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,149
THEN I THOUGHT, SOMEONE HAS ALREADY MADE THAT.

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,149
THAT'S ALREADY A THING.

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,950
BUT, I DECIDED TO MAKE IT MYSELF SO TODAY I'M

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,069
GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW I MADE THAT HAPPEN.

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,260
AND I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE HOW MANY OF YOU IN

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,489
THE ROOM HAVE DONE A PROJECT WITH RASPBERRY PI

00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,489
BEFORE?

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,489
OKAY, COOL.

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,489
AND HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE WRITTEN ANY KIND OF WEB

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:26,489
APP BEFORE?

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,489
AWESOME.

00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,250
FOR ME IT WAS A HELLO PROJECT, AND THAT'S THE WAY

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,680
I'M GOING TO APPROACH IT BUT I HOPE IT GIVES YOU

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,950
SOME INSPIRATION FOR COOL HOME SMART PROJECTS OF

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,950
YOUR OWN.

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,260
SO THE GOAL AS I SAID IS TO BE ABLE TO TURN YOUR

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,599
AIR CONDITIONER ON AND OFF WHEN YOU'RE NOT AT

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,129
HOME, BUT ALSO TO BE ABLE TO TURN IT INTO A

00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,670
THERMOSTAT SO IT CAN CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE FOR

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,670
YOU.

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,160
BUT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC, IT'S GOING

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,380
TO BE SOMETHING A LITTLE LIKE THIS.

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,240
YOU'LL HAVE A RASPBERRY PI THAT CONTROLS YOUR AIR

00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,730
CONDITIONER AND THE AIR TEMPERATURE AND IT WILL

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,620
BE CHECKING IN, SAYING, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON,

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,060
WHAT DO I DO?

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,950
AT SOME TIME, YOU'LL TELL IT, "TURN ON."

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,510
WHEN IT CHECKS IN NEXT, IT WILL GET THAT INSTRUCTION AND IT WILL TURN ON.

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,700
AND IN A SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED WAY, YOU'LL DO -- WANT TO SET A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE.

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,140
SO, AGAIN, THE RASPBERRY PI WILL BE CHECKING IN,

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,560
CHECKING IN, AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LL TELL IT, BE AT

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,260
72 DEGREES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHEN THE

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,260
AIR CONDITIONER NEXT CHECKS IN, YOUR SERVER WILL

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:33,159
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT SHOULD DO AND IT WILL RESPOND ACCORDINGLY.

00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,269
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS, FIRST I'LL TALK

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,389
ABOUT HOW TO SETS UP THE HARDWARE TO MAKE THESE

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,469
THINGS POSSIBLE AND THEN TALK ABOUT WRITING A

00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,059
SIMPLE WEB APP IN FLASK SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER.

00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:51,730
TO GET STARTED, YOU'LL NEED SOME STUFF, SO ASSUMING YOU ALREADY HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONER,

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,629
I ESTIMATE THE COST FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS,

00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:57,599
WHEN I DID THE PROJECT WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 80 AND

00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,599
$100.

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,030
THE GREAT THING IS, ALL OF THESE PARTS ARE REUSABLE SO WHEN IT'S WINTER AND YOU DON'T

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,069
NEED YOUR AIR CONDITIONER, YOU CAN STATE APART

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,069
AND USE EVERYTHING AGAIN.

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,750
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ADAFRUIT.COM, PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I BOUGHT AND EVERYTHING I USE ALL

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,760
THE TUTORIALS I USED CAME FROM ADAFRUIT, SO I

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
YOU'LL NEED AN AIR CONDITIONER.

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,269
TO DID THE PROJECT THE WAY I DID IT, NEEDS TO BE

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:22,530
WINDOW UNIT AIR CONDITIONER THAT PLUGS INTO A.C. POWER, DRAWS LESS THAN 15 AMPS, AND AS

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:29,190
ALWAYS, THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG SO YOU KNOW, JUST BE MINDFUL

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,419
OF THAT, BUT MY AIR CONDITIONER IS STILL INTACT.

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,980
YOU NEED A RASPBERRY PI.

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,790
YOU NEED SOME OTHER COMPONENTS FOR IT, AND DON'T

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,030
WE ARE IF I'M GOING A LITTLE QUICKLY THROUGH THIS, I WILL MAKE THE SLIDES AVAILABLE LATER

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,660
AND I ALSO WROTE A BLOG POST ABOUT GETTING STARTED

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:50,060
WITH RASPBERRY PI FOR THE FIRST TIME IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT, THERE WERE SOME THING THAT

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
WERE A BIT TRICKY FOR ME LIKE SETTING SET UP WITH

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
WiFi, SO CHECK IT OUT.

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,000
NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE STUFF, A POWER SWITCH OR

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,740
RELAY, WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT, A TEMPERATURE SENSOR, SOME WIRES, PCB PAPER, SOME TOOLS

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,530
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO WITH THOSE LATER.

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,199
AND FOR TESTING OR DEBUGGING, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU HAVE A BREAD BOARD AND SOME LEDs AND THAT'S

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,150
JUST SO THAT YOU CAN DO A SOLDER-LESS CIRCUIT, PLUG AND PLAY, AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO HAVE

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,639
ANY HOT METAL AND HONESTLY YOU COULD DO THE WHOLE

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,480
PROJECT JUST WITH A BREAD BOARD, IT HOLDS THINGS IN

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,420
PRETTY TIGHTLY BUT THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,120
THINGS COULD FALL OUT. AND A MULTI-METER IS NICE TO HAVE FOR DEBUGGING

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
BUT DEFINITELY NOT NECESSARY.

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,090
SO NOW THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE STUFF, I'M GOING TO

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:34,620
TALK ABOUT HOW TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IN ORDER TO

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:45,190
LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THIS APPLICATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD.

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:53,420
SO THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT THE RASPBERRY PI IS

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,210
GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO.

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:06,750
IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO TURN YOUR AIR CONDITIONER ON AND OFF, AND IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,100
THE TEMPERATURE IN YOUR ROOM.

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,990
SO TO DO THAT, TWO SIMPLE CIRCUITS.

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,360
FIRST, WE'LL NEED TO MAKE THE RASPBERRY PI ABLE

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,850
TO CONTROL THE AIR CONDITIONER SO TO DO THAT, WE'LL USE A RELAY, AN ELECTRICALLY CONTROLLED

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,850
SWITCH.

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,390
SO IT'S AS IF YOU TOOK YOUR AIR CONDITIONER'S POWER CORD AND JUST CUT IT IN THE MIDDLE AND

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,520
BETWEEN THE PART THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL AND THE

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,710
PART THAT PLUGS INTO YOUR AIR CONDITIONER, YOU

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,660
PUT LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH BUT INSTEAD OF CONTROLLING IT WITH YOUR HAND, WE'RE JUST

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,220
GOING TO CONTROL IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF POWER COMING

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,090
FROM ONE OF THE RASPBERRY PI'S OUTPUT PINS.

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,090
SO WHEN POWER FLOWS FROM THAT PIN, THE SWITCH WILL CLOSE AND POWER CAN FLOW FROM THE WALL

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,090
TO YOUR AIR CONDITIONER AND WHEN WE SET THAT

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,010
OUTPUT PIN LOW AND NO POWER COMES FROM IT, THEN THE

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,860
SWITCH WILL OPEN AND THE AIR CONDITIONER WILL TURN OFF, AND THE AIR CONDITIONER ITSELF WILL

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,490
ALWAYS BE IN THE ON POSITION, SO ON MINE, THAT'S

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,020
JUST THE DIAL IS TURNED TO "ON" ALL THE TIME.

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,070
AND SO THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS CONSULT A

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:04,780
PIN-OUT MAP OF YOUR RASPBERRY PI AND I LOOK TO

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,780
LOOK AT ONE THAT HAS THE PICTURE OF THE RASPBERRY PI IN THE BACKGROUNDS SO YOU CAN BE ORIENTED

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,820
AND FIND A PIN LABELED GPIO FOR GENERAL PURPOSE

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
INPUT/OUTPUT.

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I HAPPENED TO USE A TEMPERATURE SENSOR THAT HAD

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,630
SOME CODE, THAT HARD-CODED USING GPI 4 SO I USED

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,010
THAT ONE, SO LET'S GO PICK PIC GPIO 17.

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,490
SO CONNECT BRIGHTLY COLORED WIRE TO THAT ONE AND

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,990
THEN A DARK-COLORED WIRE, JUST SO YOU KNOW WHICH

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,930
ONE HAS POWER FLOWING FROM IT, AND CONNECT THAT

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,320
TO GROUND.

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,960
AND THEN YOU'LL TAKE YOUR POWER SWITCH AND THE

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,130
RED WIRE WILL GO INTO THE PLUS-IN SPOT AND THE

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,580
BLACK WIRE GOES INTO MINUS IN, AND YOU CAN IGNORE

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,530
THE THIRD SPOT LABELED "GROUND" BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY GROUNDED.

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,270
AND IT HAS SOME SCREW DRIVERS IN THE TOP -- HAS SOME SCREWS IN THE TOP SO YOU CAN PUTS THE

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,960
WIRE IN AND SCREW IT BACK DOWN SO IT DOESN'T JUST

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,389
FALL OUT AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE AIR

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,389
CONDITIONER RELIABLY.

00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,570
NOW, WHILE YOU'RE TESTING YOUR APPLICATION, ONCE

00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,760
WE'VE WRITTEN IT, THERE'S REALLY NO REASON TO BE

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:05,110
CONNECTED TO THE POWER SWITCH OR YOUR AIR CONDITIONER AT ALL.

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,110
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO LUG AROUND WITH YOU, YOU

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,820
MIGHT WANT TO TEST IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND BECAUSE

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,220
ALL WE'RE DOING IS CONTROLLING WHETHER POWER IS

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,620
FLOWING FROM THAT RASPBERRY PI OUTPUT PIN, YOU

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,770
CAN JUST CONNECT IT TO AN LED IN YOUR BRED BOARD

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,110
AND IF YOU CAN TURN YOUR LIGHT ON, YOU CAN TURN

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,110
YOUR AIR CONDITIONER ON.

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,430
SO NOW THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE AIR CONDITIONER FROM THE RASPBERRY PI, WE ALSO NEED TO BE

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,110
ABLE TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM.

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,659
TO DO THAT, I USED A DIGITAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR AND I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT

00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,940
HOW THE CIRCUIT IS WIRED UP.

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,010
AGAIN, I BOUGHT IT FROM ADAFRUIT THEY HAD A NICE

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,550
TUTORIAL, CODE SAMPLE, REALLY EASY.

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,730
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THE YELLOW WIRE IS THE

00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,680
DATA WIRE AND THAT WILL ALSO BE CONNECTED TO A

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,920
GPIO PIN BUT THIS TIME WILL BE READING FROM IT,

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,519
WILL BE COLLECTING DATA AND THAT WILL BE CONVERTED INTO FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS DEGREES,

00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,620
WHATEVER YOU PREFER.

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,760
AND SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO SEE THE

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,990
DIAGRAM THIS WAY. AND THEN, ONCE YOU'RE ALL SET WITH THAT, YOU

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,209
CAN SOLDER IT TOGETHER ON SOME PROTOTYPE PCB PAPER

00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,130
BUT, AGAIN, YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE TO, YOU CAN

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,670
LEAVE IT IN THE BREAD BOARD.

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,500
SO NOW WE HAVE ALL THE CONNECTIONS IN PLACE THAT

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,820
WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE AIR CONDITIONER TO

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
CONTROL -- FOR THE RASPBERRY PI TO CONTROL YOUR

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
AIR CONDITIONER AND SENSE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM.

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
SO WE HAVE THE AIR CONDITIONER, THE RASPBERRY PI,

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,920
THE DIGITAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR AND THEY'RE ALL

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
CONNECTED.

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,879
NOW THAT THAT IS READY, I'M GOING TO TALK A BIT

00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:34,050
ABOUT HOW TO WRITE A SIMPLE WEB APP IN FLASK BECAUSE IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE ALL THIS HARDWARE

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,059
CONNECTED BUT IF WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH IT IN

00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,399
ANY WAY, IT'S KIND OF USELESS.

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,309
SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING HOSTED SOMEWHERE ON THE INTERNET WHERE YOU CAN GO TO A PAGE

00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,519
IN YOUR BROWSER AND YOU CAN SEND SOME INSTRUCTIONS

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,730
THAT YOU WANT YOUR AIR CONDITIONER TO FOLLOW, AND

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,750
THE RASPBERRY PI WILL ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,050
REACH THIS PLACE, WHEREVER IT IS, AND GET SOME

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,660
INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE LEFT FOR IT AND TELL YOU

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,910
WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS ENGINEER ROOM AND OTHER

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,829
THINGS -- IS IN YOUR ROOM AND OTHER THINGS LIKE

00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,829
THAT.

00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,209
AND WE'LL NEED TO BE ABLE TO STORE THAT INFORMATION IN BETWEEN, SO THE RASPBERRY PI

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,809
WILL CHECK IN AND SAY, IT'S 70 DEGREES IN YOUR

00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,379
ROOM AND THE AIR CONDITIONER IS ON.

00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:04,680
WE'LL NEED TO STORE THAT SO WHEN THE USER GOES TO

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,329
THE PAGE IN THEIR BROWSER, THEY CAN SEE THAT INFORMATION AND THEY CAN ALSO SEND SOME

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:14,160
INFORMATION, NEED TO STORE -- OH, THE USER SAID

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,910
THEY WANT THE AIR CONDITIONER TO BE ON SO THAT

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,640
WHEN THE RASPBERRY PI CHECKS IN, IT WILL GET THAT

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
INFORMATION BACK.

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,170
TO DO THIS, I USED GLASS, WHICH IS A WEB MIGHT BE

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,779
ROW FRAMEWORK FOR PYTHON.

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,579
SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT, REALLY EASY TO SET UN, CAN

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,470
WRITE A ONE-PAGE APPLICATION SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,050
SOME REALLY GREAT RESOURCES OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET.

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,270
AND IN PARTICULAR, THE FLASK TUTORIAL, DEFINITELY MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU EVEN NEED TO DO

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,270
THIS PROJECT BUT IT'S SUPER INTERESTING READ.

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,930
SO YOU JUST SET UPROOT DIRECTORY WITH YOUR APP.PI

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,370
FILE IN IT AND TWO SUBDIRECTORIES, ASSETS AND

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,310
TERM PLATES, ASSETS FOR ANY CSS OR -- AND TEMP

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,540
PLATES FOR HTML, AND THIS IS WHAT A SIMPLE HOLLOW

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,160
WORLD APPLICATION LOOKS LIKE IN FLASK.

00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,629
AND YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THE DECORATOR SYNTAX AND IF

00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:02,499
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH DECORATORS IN PYTHON, THAT'S

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:03,499
AWESOME.

00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,699
IF YOU'RE NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH THEM, THAT'S ALSO TOTALLY FINE.

00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,899
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THIS SAYS, ADD THE FOLLOWING RULE.

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:13,029
WHEN WE GET A REQUEST FROM A URL LIKE SLASH, IN

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,959
THIS CASE, WWW.MYSITE.COM SLASH, THEN RUN THE

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,449
FOLLOWING FUNNELS, RUN THE HELLO FUNCTION HIM AND

00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:23,089
THAT FUNCTION IS GOING TO GO FIND THE TEMPLATE CALLED INDEX POTT HTML, WILL PASS IN WHATEVER

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,480
VARIABLES WE'VE GIVEN IT AND FLASK COMES WITH A

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,879
TEMPLATING ENGINE CALLED GINGA, SO IT WILL POP

00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,369
THAT DATA INTO THE TEMPLATE AND THEN DISPLAY --

00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:34,209
OH, I GUESS THAT'S A LITTLE OFF THE SCREEN.

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,129
OH, I GUESS IT'S STILL OFF THE SCREEN.

00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:43,509
IT WILL DISPLAY SOMETHING LIKE HELD LOW, WORLD AND HELLO, MIRIAM.

00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,310
IF YOU RUN IT IN DEBUG MODE, YOU'LL GET A NICE

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,829
STACK TRACE ON THE PAGE WHICH IS CONVENIENT.

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:52,130
WITH THAT HELLO WORLD APPLICATION, WE ONLY HAD

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,850
ONE END POINT, THE HELLO ROUTE, AND FOR THIS APPLICATION, WE'LL ACTUALLY NEED THREE END

00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,240
POINTS, SO, FIRST, WE HAVE THE HOME PAGE, AND FOR

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,540
THAT, WE'LL JUST GET SOME INFORMATION THAT THE

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,610
SERVER HAS STORED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,221
ROOM AND DISPLAY THE FORM THAT YOU WOULD USE TO

00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,689
SEND SOME INFORMATION TO YOUR SERVER ABOUT WHAT

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:18,019
YOU WANT THE AIR CONDITIONER TO DO. AND THEN WE'LL NEED TO WRITE THE END POINT

00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,019
TO ACTUALLY DO THAT, TO ALLOW YOU TO SUBMIT THAT

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,809
FORM WITH YOUR INSTRUCTIONS, AND WE'LL NEED A

00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,860
ROOT FOR THE RASPBERRY PI TO CHECK IN, GIVE THE

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,071
SERVER INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:30,071
ROOM AND GET INSTRUCTIONS BACK.

00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:33,420
SO THE FIRST END POINT FOR THE HOME PAGE LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE HELLO WORLD EXAMPLE.

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,380
AND YOU CAN SEE, YOU CAN ADD AS MANY ROOT DECORATORS AS YOU WANT SO IN THIS CASE BOTH

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,319
SLASH AND INDEX WILL GIVE YOU THE HOME PAGE.

00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,670
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WE'LL NEED TO GET DATA

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,660
THAT HAS BEEN STORED BY THE RASPBERRY PI TO DISPLAY, AND YOU CAN DO THAT REALLY HOWEVER

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,930
YOU WANT.

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,399
WHEN I DID IT, I USED THE PYTHON SQL 8 LIBRARY 3,

00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,379
MOSTLY I WANTED TO KEEP SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS IN MY ROOM AND HOW

00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,420
MUCH I WAS USING MY AIR CONDITIONER BUT IF YOU

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,380
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, AND HOPEFULLY NO ONE WILL

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,959
YELL AT ME BUT YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST STORE IT IN

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,569
A GLOBAL VARIABLE AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:18,910
AND IT WILL DISPLAY A BEAUTIFUL PAGE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND YOU'LL SEE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,440
INFORMATION YOU HAVE ABOUT YOUR ROOM AND YOUR AIR

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
CONDITIONER AND THE FORM YOU WOULD USE TO SEND

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
SOME INFORMATION.

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE, THE USER HAS SORT OF THREE

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
POSSIBLE THINGS THEY MIGHT WANT TO SAY TO THEIR

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
AIR CONDITIONER.

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,529
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY JUST TURN ON AND BE ON, OR

00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:34,079
YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST SAY TURN ON AND BE OFF OR

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,350
YOU MIGHT WANTS TO SAY, KEEP MY ROOM AT 72 DEGREES.

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,939
BUT THE THING IS, THE RASPBERRY PI REALLY ONLY

00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,579
UNDERSTANDS TWO STATES.

00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:47,579
IT CAN SETS THE SWITCH PIN HIGH AND TURN ITS ON

00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,850
OR SET IT LOW AND TURN THE AIR CONDITIONER OFF SO

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,790
WE NEED A WAY TO TRANSLATE BETWEEN WHAT THE USER

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,160
WANTS THE AIR CONDITIONER TO BE DOING AND WHAT

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,990
THE RASPBERRY PI CAN ACTUALLY CARRY OUT.

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,660
SO THERE WILL BE SORT OF A MIDDLE LAYER, WE'LL GO

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,110
FROM THE THREE STATES THE USER KNOWS AND THEN WRITE A FUNCTION TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO THE

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,570
STATE THE RASPBERRY PI UNDERSTANDS, AND ON AND OFF,

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,430
TO MAP NICELY TO ON AND OFF BUT WHEN SPECIFY

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,509
A TEMPERATURE, I'LL NEED TO CHECK WHAT IS THE

00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,939
TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW, WHAT TEMPERATURE DID THE USER SAY THEY WANTED AND

00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,679
THEN RETURN A RESPOND TO RASPBERRY PI WITH EITHER

00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,809
ONE OR ZERO, ON OR OFF, ACCORDINGLY.

00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:28,279
SO NOW WE'LL WRITE THAT END POINT FOR THE USER

00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,209
AND WE'LL GET THE DATA THAT THEY SEND IN THEIR POST REQUEST, FIND THE MOST RECENTLY TRANSLATED

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:37,130
TEMPERATURE, TRANSLATES THAT INTO THE DESIRED STATE AND STORE THAT SOMEWHERE.

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:49,369
FINALLY, WE'LL WRITE THE ROOT FOR THE RASPBERRY PI AND WE'LL GET THE DATA FROM THE RASPBERRY

00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:54,040
PI'S POST-REQUEST, STORE THAT TEMPERATURE AND THE

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,769
AIR CONDITIONER STATE SOMEWHERE, AND THEN WE'LL

00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,769
RESPOND TO THAT REQUEST WITH WHATEVER THE MOST

00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:57,769
RECENTLY STORED DESIRED STATE FROM THE USER IS.

00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,949
SO NOW THAT THAT APPLICATION IS UP AND RUNNING, THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS IT'S ALL WELL

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,129
AND GOOD, WE COULD GO TO THIS WEBSITE, WE COULD

00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,240
SEND SOME INFORMATION, SAY WE WANT THE AIR CONDITIONER

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,114
TO BE ON BUT IF THE RASPBERRY PI ISN'T CHECKING IN WITH THE SERVER, IT'S NEVER GOING TO GET

00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,360
THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WE'RE SENDING

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,310
IT INSTRUCTIONS IS WE'RE RESPONDING TO THE RASPBERRY

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,310
PI'S POST REQUEST.

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,399
SO RASPBERRY PI WILL NEED TO MAKE REQUESTS, SET

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,399
THE SWITCH PIN HIGH OR LOW ACCORDINGLY AND DO

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,399
THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,399
SO IN ORDER TO MAKE REQUESTS, I USE THE REQUEST LIBRARY.

00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,429
IT'S GREAT, SUPER EASY.

00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:21,170
YOU PUT IN THE URL/THE ROOT -- THE ENDS POINT YOU

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,680
JUST WROTE, SEND THE DATA ABOUT THE ROOM AND THE

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,940
AIR CONDITIONER, AND THE RESPONSE WILL BE STORED

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,610
IN THIS VARIABLE "R." AND THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SET THE SWITCH

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,410
PIN AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU NEED ANOTHER

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,529
PYTHON LIBRARY CALLED RPYTHON.GPIO.

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:45,110
YOU TELL IT WHICH ONE YOU'RE USING AS THE SWITCH

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,509
PIN, YOU'LL TELL IT IT'S AN OUTPUT PIN AND SET IT

00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,449
FALSE TO START, AND WRITE A SIMPLE FUNCTION TO

00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,389
CHECK WHETHER THAT PIN IS HIGH OR LOW.

00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:58,129
FINALLY, WE'LL PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND CONTROL THE AIR CONDITIONER, MAGICALLY.

00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,850
IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS, MAKE THE REQUEST, GET THE

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,430
RESPONSE AND FIT COMES BACK WITH 1, SET THE SWITCH PIN HIGH AND TURN THE AIR CONDITIONER

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,430
ON.

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,509
COMES BACK WITH ZERO, THEN WE'LL SET THE SWITCH PIN LOW AND TURN THE AIR CONDITIONER OFF.

00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,739
NOW, THAT'S GREAT IF WE DO THAT ONCE, MAYBE GET

00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:19,279
ONE INSTRUCTION BUT WE'LL NEED TO PUT THAT IN A

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,649
LOOP AND DO THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,949
AND I THINK MINE WAS GOING LIKE EVERY SECOND OR

00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:26,949
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:30,249
AND THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD AND IT WORKS FOR A

00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,699
WHILE BUT WHAT HAPPENS -- OOPS.

00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,730
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SERVER DOESN'T RESPOND?

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,059
AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT SOME POINT.

00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,379
YOU'RE JUST MAKING REQUESTS OVER AND OVER AND

00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:41,799
OVER AGAIN, AND RIGHT NOW, IF WE JUST HAVE A WILD

00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:48,420
LOOP, IT'S GOING TO BREAK, EXIT AND WE'LL LOSE

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,319
CONTACT WITH THE RASPBERRY PI ENTIRELY.

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,690
AND THAT KIND OF WAS MY WORST-CASE SCENARIO THAT

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,540
I WOULD BE AWAY FROM HOME, TURN THE AIR CONDITIONER ON FOR SOME REASON AND EVERYTHING

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,699
WOULD CRASH AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TURN IT OFF

00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,459
AND IT WOULD BE SITTING THERE WASTING POWER.

00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,459
SO JUST TO MAKE THAT A BIT MORE RESILIENT, WE CAN

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,190
PUT THAT IN A TRICATCH LOCK, TRY TO MAKE THE REQUEST.

00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,000
IF IT SUCCEEDS, KEEP GOING IN THE LOOP, WAITS A

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
SECOND, TRY AGAIN.

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
WAIT A SECOND, DO IT AGAIN.

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,770
BUT IF IT FAILS, THEN WE'LL CHECK HOW LONG HAS IT

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,790
BEEN SINCE THE LAST TIME WE GOT A SUCCESSFUL REQUEST?

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,160
AND IF IT'S BEEN UNDER FIVE MINUTES, JUST KEEP

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,220
GOING, JUST KEEP TRYING.

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,819
IF IT'S BEEN OVER FIVE MINUTES, TURN THE AIR CONDITIONER OFF AND THEN JUST KEEP TRYING

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,100
BECAUSE HOPEFULLY THE SERVER WILL COME BACK AT SOME

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,320
POINT OR YOU'LL FIX IT, YOU'LL GO IN AND SEE WHAT

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,780
WENT WRONG AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO SSH BACK

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,670
INTO YOUR RASPBERRY PI AND START THE PROGRAM RUNNING AGAIN.

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,130
IT JUST HOPEFULLY WON'T CRASH AND WILL JUST KEEP

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,640
WAITING AND THAT WAY YOU CAN ENJOY A PERFECTLY TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED ROOM ALL SUMMER.

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
AND I JUST HAVE SOME FINAL NOTES, OR REALLY A

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,020
FINAL NOTE, WHICH IS ABOUT SECURITY.

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,730
AS WE ALL KNOW, THE INTERNET ISN'T THE SAFEST PLACE AND BEYOND JUST LIKE SOMEONE MALICIOUS

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,809
TRYING TO EXECUTE CODE ON YOUR SERVER OR SOMETHING COMPLICATED, IT WOULD BE PRETTY

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,490
BAD IF JUST LIKE ANY OLD PERSON COULD FIND YOUR WEBSITE

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,170
HOSTED WHEREVER ON HEROKU OR SOMETHING, AND TURN

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,170
YOUR AIR CONDITIONER ON.

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,330
SO AT MINIMUM, JUST LIKE YOU CAN USE ROUTE DECORATORS IN FLASK TO MAP URLS TO FUNCTION,

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,660
YOU CAN USE OTHER DECORATORS, SO YOU COULD WRITE

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,590
A LOG-IN REQUIRED FUNCTION THAT CHECKS SOME

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,810
CREDENTIALS OF SOME SORT, USE A DECORATOR, WRAP

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,980
THAT AROUND YOUR VIEW FUNCTION AND THEN IF THE

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,750
CREDENTIALS AREN'T THERE, DON'T EXECUTE THE FUNCTION, AND YOU SHOULD ALSO PROBABLY CHECK

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,430
THAT THE INPUT THAT YOU'RE GETTING IS WHAT YOU

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,810
EXPECT SO IF IT'S THE FORM IN THE BROWSER YOU EXPECT

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,960
TO BE GETTING A NUMBER AND YOU EXPECT IT TO BE

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,340
A TEMPERATURE IN SOME REASONABLE RANGE, AND

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,680
IF IT'S THE RASPBERRY PI, YOU EXPECT TO GET THE

00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,860
TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM AND JUST A BOOLEAN ON-OFF, SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE SURE OF

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
THAT.

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,650
AND NOW I WILL SHOW YOU A QUICK DEMO OF MY AIR

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,650
CONDITIONER IN ACTION.

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,030
IT IS NOT THE BEST VIDEO AND IT WILL ONLY WORK IF

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,360
YOU'RE ALL VERY QUIET.

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,510
I'M JUST GOING TO DO A QUICK DEMONSTRATION HERE.

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,410
HOW I CAN TURN MY AIR CONDITIONER ON FROM MY

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,320
BROWSER, SO I'M GOING TO GO OVER TO THIS PAGE.

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,490
AND JUST REFRESH.

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,030
OKAY, SO MY AIR CONDITIONER IS OFF, IF YOU CAN

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,030
SEE THAT.

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,030
IT IS IN FACT OFF.

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,030
YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,330
AND YOU WON'T SEE ANY LITTLE RED LIGHT ON THE

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,060
POWER SWITCH.

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,491
I'M DOING TO TELL IT "TURN ON," SO I CLICK THAT

00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,130
RADIO BUTTON, HIT "SUBMIT" HERE.

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,130
WAITING, WAITING.

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,130
GIVE IT A SECOND.

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,390
[ SOUNDS OF AIR CONDITIONER TURNING ON] >> DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,919
YOU CAN SEE THE RED LIGHT.

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,260
[ Laughter ] >> AND WE TELL IT TO TURN OFF.

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,010
[ AIR CONDITIONER TURNS OFF ] >> ONE TAKE.

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,010
>> ONE TAKE.

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,010
>> THERE YOU GO.

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,300
[ Applause ] THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,220
AND I'VE JUST WANTED TO SAY A QUICK THANKS TO THE

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,670
RECURSE CENTER/HACKER SCHOOL BECAUSE I COULD NOT

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,120
HAVE DONE THIS PROJECT WITHOUT EVERYONE THERE.

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
SO, THANKS.

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
[ Applause ] >> ALL RIGHT.

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
THANK YOU, MIRIAM.

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,060
IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS, THEN THEY CAN COME

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,810
UP TO THIS MICROPHONE AND ASK THEM.

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,810
THANK YOU.

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,970
[ AUDIENCE: HI, THANKS FOR THE TALK.

00:19:52,970 --> 00:20:01,450
I'M CURIOUS IF THIS PROJECT HAS MADE YOU MORE EXCITED OR LESS EXCITED ABOUT SORT OF THE

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,490
PROMISED FUTURE OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS.

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,340
>> HUM, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,420
SO, IT MADE ME REALLY EXCITED ABOUT DOING MORE

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,220
INTERNET OF THINGS, PROJECTS MYSELF, BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY FUN BUT I THINK IT KIND OF

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,670
DE-MYSTIFIED TO SOME EXTENT LIKE HOW COOL THESE

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,820
DEVICES ARE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT VERY HARD TO

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
PUT TOGETHER YOURSELF.

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,990
SO, YEAH, I -- AND I ALSO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,870
A LONG TIME BEFORE MY SMART AIR CONDITIONER CAN

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,060
DO MY LAUNDRY, SO, YOU KNOW...

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
>> AUDIENCE: THANKS FOR THE TALK.

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,140
I WAS -- I ACTUALLY DID SMART THERMOSTATS FOR A

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,090
WHILE BEFORE MY COMPANY FOLDED AND I WAS KIND OF

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,060
CURIOUS, HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO GETTING INTO MAYBE

00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,260
HUMIDITY SENSORS AND SEEING IF YOU COULD GET MORE

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,340
THERMAL COMFORT LEVELS SO, IF YOU GOT REALLY HIGH

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,150
HUMIDITY, YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GET REALLY COLD

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,980
EVEN IF IT'S SET TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS NORMAL.

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,700
>> YEAH, THAT'S A REALLY GREAT IDEA.

00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,000
I HAVEN'T TRIED TO DO THAT BUT I KNOW THERE ARE

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,320
ALL SORTS OF LIKE FUN SENSORS THAT YOU CAN GET

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,090
FOR THE RASPBERRY PI SO I'M BUILDING UP A COLLECTION OF NEW TOYS.

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,090
>> AUDIENCE: COOL.

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,269
I LOOK FORWARD TO CHECKING THAT ONE OUT.

00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,269
>> AUDIENCE: HI, MIRIAM.

00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:14,620
DID YOU DECIDE TO CHECK IN ON THE SERVER LIKE ONCE EVERY SECOND WITH ANY, LIKE, DATA OR

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,669
DID YOU JUST DECIDE THAT ARBITRARILY?

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:23,210
>> SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR THE VERY END OF THE QUESTION.

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,230
>> AUDIENCE: OR DID YOU JUST DECIDE HOW OFTEN TO

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,230
CHECK THE SERVER ARBITRARILY?

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,580
>> YES, I JUST DECIDED ARBITRARILY.

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,280
SINCE I DESIGNED THIS JUST WITH MYSELF AND MY

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,900
RASPBERRY PI IN MIND, I WASN'T THINKING VERY MUCH

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,560
LIKE BLOWING UP THE SERVER WITH REQUESTS BECAUSE IT JUST WAS ONLY ME USING IT SO I FIGURED

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,480
ONCE A SECOND WOULD DEFINITELY BE FREQUENT ENOUGH

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,630
AND WOULD BE FINE, SO IT WAS PRETTY ARBITRARY,

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,630
YEAH.

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,630
>> AUDIENCE: THANKS.

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,630
>> AUDIENCE: DO YOU THINK YOU COULD OPEN UP THE

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,290
A.C. AND FIGURE OUT THINGS LIKE FAN SPEED OR -- I

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,960
MEAN, MORE THAN JUST ON AND OFF?

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,710
DID YOU LEARN ENOUGH TO DO MORE THAN THAT?

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,180
>> AT THE TIME THAT I WAS DOING THIS PROJECT, I

00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,520
DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE NEEDED SOME HELP TO DO THAT

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,380
AND I PROBABLY STILL WOULD.

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,310
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I SORT OF WEIGHED THE

00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:25,940
CHANCES THAT I WOULD BREAK SOMETHING OR SET MY

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,330
ROOM ON FIRE AGAINST LIKE HOW COOL THAT WOULD BE,

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:37,320
SO -- BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE ONE DAY.

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:45,850
>> AUDIENCE: HEY, THANKS FOR THE TALK.

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:59,540
SO I THINK THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN WAKING UP

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:06,640
WITHOUT MY A.C. ON WOULD BE HAVING TO GET ON MY

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:15,340
COMPUTER AND REBOOT A SERVER BECAUSE MY A.C. ISN'T ON.

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:33,520
DID YOU THINK ABOUT ANY WAYS THAT, LIKE -- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE IDEA TO TURN THE A.C.

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,390
OFF IF IT'S NOT RESPONDING BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,250
TO JUST LEAVE THE THING ON.

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:49,580
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WAYS YOU COULD, LIKE, GET

00:23:49,580 --> 00:24:00,030
AROUND THAT AND, I DON'T KNOW, MAKE IT FAIL-PROOF BUT ALSO HIT A TARGETED TEMPERATURE OR SOMETHING

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,200
LIKE THAT?

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:17,130
>> YEAH, I MEAN, SO I MIGHT JUST AS A VERY SIMPLE

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,200
SOLUTION TO THAT KIND OF -- IF IT'S IN THE, LIKE,

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:46,850
ON-ON STATE, THEN TURN IT OFF BECAUSE IT WOULD NEVER TURN ITSELF OFF BUT IF IT'S IN TEMPERATURE

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:53,120
CONTROL STATE, IT COULD PROBABLY SURVIVE ON ITS

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,830
OWN FOR A WHILE UNTIL I GET HOME BUT IN ORDER TO

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:03,850
DO THAT, I WOULD HAVE TO ALSO MAKE SURE TO STORE,

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:16,880
LIKE, WHAT THE RASPBERRY PI THINKS THE STATE IS

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:31,730
AND I KIND OF LEFT THAT LOGIC ON THE SERVER SO IT

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,880
WOULD DEFINITELY BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT, YEAH.

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:43,010
>> A LITTLE BIT OF SHAMELESS ADVERTISING, I WANT

00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:53,600
TO SAY IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED IN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:09,030
MONITORING, I HAVE THIS VERY LARGE AND EXTENSIVE OPEN SOURCE PROJECT WRITTEN IN PEARL THAT

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:33,460
NEEDS TO BE IMPORTED TO PYTHON SO 

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:43,330
IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED, I 

00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:59,050
WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO GET SOME HELP AND 

00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:37,400
IT WOULD RELATE VERY NICELY TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,740
GREAT TALK, THANK YOU.

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:59,730
>> AUDIENCE: HEY, CAN YOU DO 

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:44,850
THE SAME THING WITH A SPACE HEATER OR 

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:59,650
IS IT TO ELECTRICALLY TOO DANGEROUS OR SOMETHING?

00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:38,320
>> SPACE HEATERS ARE PRETTY DANGEROUS.

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,410
I WOULD NOT DO IT.

00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,630
BUT THAT'S ME.

00:29:44,630 --> 00:31:44,360
IF YOU LIKE TO LIVE ON THE EDGE, I TOLD YOU NOT

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,850
TO.

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,350
[ Laughter ] ANYBODY ELSE?

00:31:50,350 --> 00:32:12,040
ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH, YOU GUYS.
