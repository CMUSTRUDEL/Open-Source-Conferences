Title: Allison Kaptur - Exploring is never boring: understanding CPython without reading the code
Publication date: 2015-04-12
Playlist: PyCon 2015
Description: 
	"Speaker: Allison Kaptur

Have you started to read the source code of CPython but not gotten as far as you wanted? Maybe you want to understand more about CPython but don't know where to begin. I'll present a number of strategies for getting more familiar with Python under the hood that go beyond ""just read it!"" This talk isn't about contributing - it's about getting into the code base and discovering interesting things.

WELCOME TO THE SECOND OF TWO TALKS ALLISON KAPTUR

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,720
IS GIVING THIS SESSION.

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,510
SHE WORKS AT DROPBOX.

00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,001
PLEASE GIVE HER A WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:21,560
[ Applause ] >> HI, THANKS, EVERYONE, WHO CAME HERE OR

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,810
STAYED HERE FOR THIS TALK.

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,950
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EXPLORING IS

00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,920
NEVER BORING, UNDERSTANDING CPYTHON WITHOUT READING THE CODE.

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,610
AS AS THEY ARE MENTIONED, I'M ALLISON KAAP TUSH,

00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,110
CURRENTLY WORKING AT DROPBOX IN SAN FRANCISCO, I

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,860
USED TO WORK AT RECURES SCHOOL, WHICH YOU MAY

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,910
KNOW AS HACKER SCHOOL.

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,180
RECURS CENTER IS NOT A BOOT CAMP, A WRITER'S RETREAT FOR PROGRAMMERS, SO IF YOU'VE BEEN

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,570
TO THE PY CON SPRINTS BEFORE, IT'S LIKE DOING THREE

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,640
MONTHS OF THAT.

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,740
THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY KNOW AT LEAST SOME PROGRAMMING GET TOGETHER AND WORK ON WHATEVER

00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,370
IT IS THAT THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT.

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,489
AND I SAY THIS BIT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,920
CONTEXT FOR THE PROBLEM THEIR WE GOING TO SOLVE

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,150
TODAY, WHICH I BET YOU CAN RELATE TO.

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,329
IN THE COURSE OF FACILITY TEENAGE YES AT THE RECURS CENTER, I TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:08,750
IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION.

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,580
THEY LEARNED A LITTLE BIT OR MAYBE A LOT OF PYTHON AND THEN YOU HAD TO MAKE THINGS WITH

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,280
IT, THEY'VE DONE A BUNCH OF PROJECTS.

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,940
AT SOME POINT, THEY STARTED TO WANT TO DIG DEEPER, SAYING HOW DOES PYTHON WORK UNDER

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,540
THE HOOD, THE WORD "REALLY" ANSWER IN THESE

00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,540
QUESTIONS.

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,530
HOW DO LISTS REALLY WORK WHEN YOU APPEND TO THEM

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,890
AND SO ON. AND VERY OFTEN, THEY FOUND IT HARD TO GET

00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,890
STARTED.

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,380
SORT OF STRUGGLED TO GET PURCHASE ON THE GIANTS SURFACE AREA THAT PYTHON PRESENTS.

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,390
SO THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR, THEN THIS TALK IS FOR

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,350
YOU. AND TODAY I'LL TALK ABOUT SOME STRATEGIES

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,300
THAT YOU CAN USE TO DEEPEN YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,620
OF PYTHON, SOME PITFALLS THAT YOU CAN HOPEFULLY

00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,020
AVOID.

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,630
THE GOAL IS TO GIVE YOU A SET OF TOOLS THAT YOU

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,420
CAN USE ON YOUR OWN AND WE'LL LAB AT SOME EXAMPLES IN CPYTHON AND FOR THE MOST PART,

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,189
THESE ARE STRATEGIES THAT YOU COULD USE ON ANY CODE

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,810
BASE.

00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,310
SO FIRST A BRIEF WORD ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,130
SPEND TIME UNDERSTANDING THE INTERNALS OF PYTHON.

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,070
I WANT TO SAY EXPLICITLY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,350
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS TO BE A GREAT PROGRAMMER OR

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,160
EVEN TO BE A GREAT PYTHON PROGRAMMER SPECIFICALLY.

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,079
THE BEST REASON TO DO THIS IS WHAT'S IN THE TITLE, SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO YOU.

00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,669
THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO, TO ME SORT OF IS THE

00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,159
TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN APPROACH.

00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,780
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERNALS OF PYTHON, HALF OF IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN C SO DO YOU HAVE

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,739
TO UNDERSTAND C REALLY WELL AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,129
A COMPUTER UNDERNEATH THAT SO WHAT ABOUT HARDWARE

00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,180
AND MEMORY AND...

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,049
I'M BASICALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S STRICTLY NECESSARY.

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,319
SO THE MAIN REASON IS THAT THIS IS FUN.

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,319
I THINK IT'S REALLY FUN.

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,439
HOPEFULLY SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO YOU.

00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,859
I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO

00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,639
ZIGGING IN ON BYTECODE AND THE BYTECODE INTERPRETER, CAN I GET A QUICK SHOW OF HANDS

00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,870
WHO WAS IN THE ROOM HALF AN HOUR AGO?

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,639
THAT'S LIKE MAYBE HALF OR MORE, GREAT.

00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,230
SO I FIND IT VERY POWERFUL THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,129
REALLY COMPLEX PROJECT THAT YOU'VE BEEN TREATING AS BASICALLY A BLACK BOX AND YOU CAN START

00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,159
TO BREAK IT DOWN, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE PIECES,

00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,650
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHY CERTAIN DECISIONS WERE

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,489
MADE THE WAY THAT THEY WERE, AND WHY CERTAIN

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,449
LIMITATIONS EXIST THE WAY THAT THEY DO.

00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,370
I THINK THAT'S ALL VERY POWERFUL AND COOL.

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,470
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK AT ALL TODAY ABOUT CONTRIBUTE TO PYTHON.

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,309
CONTRIBUTING IS GREAT AND YOU SHOULD TOTALLY DO

00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:17,569
IT IF IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO YOU.

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,830
I THINK THAT CORRECTING PRESENTS A DIFFERENT SET

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,420
OF CHALLENGES THAN THE ONE THAT I WANT TO FOCUS

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,169
ON TODAY WHICH IS UNDERSTANDING CODE BASE.

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,260
CONTRIBUTING IS HARDER IN SOME WAYS, PARTICULARLY TOOLING AND SET-UP, VERY OFTEN YOU ENDS UP

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,099
IN SOME SWORD OF BEWILDERING INSTALL HELL THAT

00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,559
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO EXTRACT YOURSELF FROM.

00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,769
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PYTHON MAILING LISTS IS GUIDO

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,430
COMPLAINING ABOUT A CHANGE MADE TO A RECENT MODULE THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A SIDE EFFECTS

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,569
OF HIS UPGRADING TO MAVERICKS.

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,769
THIS STUFF IS HARD.

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,409
THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S HARD ABOUT CONTRIBUTING IS

00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,849
THAT THERE'S ALL THIS RESTRICTIONS AROUND CULTURE

00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,499
AND COMMUNICATION AND THAT SORT OF THING THAT JUST DON'T EXIST IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH

00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:58,719
OTHER PEOPLE.

00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,360
CONTRIBUTING IS EASIER IN SOME WAYS THAN SITTING DOWN TO UNDERSTAND A CODE BASE, TOO, AND

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,969
PARTICULARLY IN SCOPING A PROJECT.

00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,139
IF YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING TO AN EXISTING PROJECT, YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONE THING IN PARTICULAR

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,579
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,459
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE THING IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, THE FIRST THING

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,609
YOU WILL DO IS GET ONE THING THAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:15,919
TO DO.

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,440
IF YOU'RE SITTING DOWN TO UNDERSTAND A CODE BASE,

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,580
IT CAN BE HARDER TO NARROW THE SCOPE.

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,520
SO I WON'T TALK TODAY ABOUT THE DEVIN OR BUG TRACKER OR HOW TO SUBMIT A PATCH.

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,400
IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT LATER, HERE'S

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
THE LINK TO THE INITIAL DEVIN GUIDE AND I THINK

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,810
THERE WAS A TALK EARLIER THAT YOU CAN CATCH THE

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,240
REPLAY OF AND THAT'S ALL I'LL SAY ABOUT CONTRIBUTING.

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,590
SO YOU'RE SITTING DOWN WITH A NEW CODE BASE AND

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,120
SETTING OUT TO UNDERSTAND IT.

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,130
I'M GUESSING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HAS HEARD ONE

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,699
PARTICULAR PIECE OF ADVICE.

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,699
READ THE CODE.

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,130
LOTS OF FOLKS WILL TELL YOU TO READ THE CODE AND

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,520
THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY BAD ADVICE.

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,530
I JUST THINK IT'S NOT ALWAYS VERY HELPFUL.

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,280
YOU MIGHT HAVE TRIED THIS, RIGHT, SO YOU GO TO,

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,760
YOU KNOW, PYTHON.ORG AND YOU DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,250
AND OPEN IT UP IN YOUR TEXT EDITOR OF CHOICE AND

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,260
NOW WHAT?

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,840
NOW YOU'RE STARING AT ALL OF THESE FILES AND MANY

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,970
OF THEM ARE THOUSANDS OF LINES LONG AND HALF OF

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,370
THEM ARE IN C AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN.

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,810
IT'S VERY EASY AT THIS POINT TO GET LOST, AND

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,980
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOU HAVE A BROAD SCOPE AND YOU SAY I WANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE,

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,760
YOU KNOW, DIG DEEPER, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,560
NARROW YET THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON.

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,510
YOU DON'T YET HAVE PARTICULAR SUBGOALS OR AREAS

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,230
OF INTEREST.

00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,150
IT'S ALSO VERY EASY AT THIS POINT TO WASTE A LOT

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,150
OF TIME.

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,200
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE LOOKING OVER DIFFERENT FILES AND YOU'RE NERVE REALLY GETTING A FOOTHOLD

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,610
SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE BAD OUTCOMES.

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,960
THIS IS MY OBJECTION TO THE IDEA OF READING THE

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
CODE.

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,440
I THINK IT'S JUST NOT A VERY HELPFUL WAY TO THINK

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,180
ABOUT INTERACTING WITH A CODE BASE, PARTICULARLY ONE THAT'S AS LARGE AS PYTHON HAVE THE IF

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,750
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT READING, IT DRAWS ANALOGIES

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,450
IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT CONSTRUCTIVE FOR THE LEARNER.

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,330
IN THE READING THAT YOU'RE USED TO, IF YOU'RE READING AN ARTICLE OR A NOVEL OR TWITTER FEED

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,830
OR WHATEVER, THERE IS AN ORDER OF CONTENT, RIGHT?

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,810
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO READ THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,390
HAPPENED LATER.

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,560
AND FINALLY, THINK ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE AS READING I THINK UNDERSELLS IT PRETTY

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,341
YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY TO

00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,870
DO THIS IT IS GOING TO FEEL REALLY HARD.

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,870
AND IF YOU THINK -- ARE THINKING OF THAT AS READING, IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DISCOURAGING

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,870
FOR YOU.

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,740
NOW, UNDERSTANDING A CODE BASE IN THIS WAY IS A

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,750
SPECIALIZED SKILL.

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,890
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THAT IS IT MEANS YOU CAN GET

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,950
BETTER AT IT WITH TECHNIQUES AND PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENT.

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,281
BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AS READING, YOU

00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,450
SHOULD EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE VERY CHALLENGING.

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,590
AND CALLING IT READING REALLY UNDERSELLS THAT.

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,590
JUST TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT A BIT, THERE IS A

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,340
GREAT SHORT PAPER CALLED "HOW TO READ A PAPER."

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,860
AND SPOILER ALERT, IT DOES NOT SAY IF THE PAPER

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,060
IS IN ENGLISH, START AT THE TOP AND GO LEFT TO

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,360
RIGHT, TOP TO BOTTOM.

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,470
THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF STRATEGIES THAN THAT.

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,390
AND READING A PAPER, EVEN A TECHNICAL ONE IS A

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,860
LOT CLOSER TO THE READING THAT WE'RE USED TO,

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,870
LIKE READING A BOOK OR AN ARTICLE THAN READING CODES IS.

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,200
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT READING A PAPER IS A SPECIALIZED SKILL, AND YOU SHOULD, YOU SHOULD

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,080
GO READ THIS PAPER, THEN YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,140
AGREE THAT READING A CODE BASE IS A SPECIALIZED

00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,820
SKILL AND INTERACTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,290
SO CONSUMING INFORMATION IN THIS WAY IS A SKILL.

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,940
YOU CAN GET BETTER AT WITNESS STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES AND READING IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,880
A HELPFUL MENTAL MODEL OF WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,890
TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW MENTAL MODELS THAT I BELIEVE ARE HELPFUL FOR DIGGING INTO

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,550
THE INNARDS OF PYTHON THAT GO BEYOND READ THE

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,480
SOURCE.

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:33,370
THESE ARE GUIDING METAPHORS FOR INTERACTION WITH

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,480
CODE BOYS AND I'LL SUGGEST SOME TOOLS THAT YOU

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,650
CAN USE THAT FIT INTO THAT MODEL AND WE'LL LOOK

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,320
AT A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF PUTTING THAT STRATEGY TO

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,380
WORK.

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,540
THE FIRST WAY THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT INTERACTING WITH THE CODE BASE IS DELIBERATE OBSERVATION,

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,070
AND THIS WAS REALLY WELL-ARTICULATED BY PETER

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,210
SEEBOLD IN A BLOG POST I BELIEVE LAST YEAR AND PART

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,960
OF IT READS, CODE IS NOT LITERATURE AND WE ARE NOT

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
READERS.

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,200
RATHER, INTERESTING PIECES OF CODE ARE SPECIMENS AND WE ARE NATURALISTS.

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
HE GOES ON TO SAY, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PICK OUT

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,380
A PIECE OF CODE AND READING IT AND DISCUSSING IT

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,920
LIKE A BUNCH OF COMP LIT GRAD STUDENTS, I THINK A

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,130
BETTER MODEL IS FOR ONE OF US TO PLAY THE ROLE OF

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,690
A 19th CENTURY NATURALIST, RETURNING FROM A

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,130
TRIP TO AN EXOTIC ISLAND TO PRESENT TO THE LOCAL

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,800
SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY A DISCUSSION OF THE BEETLES THEY FOUND.

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,190
LOOK AT THE ANTENNAS ON THIS MONSTER, THEY LOOK

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,080
UNGAINLY BUT THE MALE OF THE SPECIES CAN USE THEM

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,690
TO KILL SMALL FROGS IN WHOSE CARCASS THE FEMALES LAY THEIR EGGS.

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,010
[ Laughter ] SO THE NATURALIST MODEL IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,190
FROM THE READING MODEL.

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,439
MEANS THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THE CODE IS INHABITING.

00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:40,510
YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, HISTORY, EVOLUTION OF THE

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,870
CODE AND YOU REMEMBER THAT NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,699
THE CODE IS NECESSARILY DELIBERATE OR INTENTIONAL.

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:52,470
SO BACK IN COLORADO STATE ASTRO PHYSICS, MY UNDERGRAD THESIS WAS OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY.

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,750
THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,029
EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY.

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,730
THERE ARE THREE WAYS OF LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD.

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,521
THE FIRST IS THEORY, SOMETIMES AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO AS THE FINEMAN METHOD, YOU WRITE

00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,649
DOWN THE PROBLEM AND THINK VERY HARD AND WRITE

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,660
DOWN A SOLUTION.

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,360
[ Laughter ] THE SECOND WAY OF LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,860
IS THROUGH COMPUTER MODELS, BASICALLY.

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,649
AND THEN THE THIRD IS JUST LOOKING AT WHAT'S OUT

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,890
THERE IN THE UNIVERSE AND HAPPENS TO BE SENDING PHOTONS TOWARDS EARTH AND HOPEFULLY HITTING

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,320
TELESCOPES, THOSE ARE YOUR ONLY OPTIONS.

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,980
IF YOU'RE DOING OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY, THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION YOU CAN ASK

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,879
YOURSELF IS WHY ARE WE SEEING WHAT WE'RE SEEING.

00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,480
TO WHY DO WE SEE SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLES NEAR

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,939
WEIRD-LOOKING GALAXIES.

00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:41,610
AND IN THAT CASE, THE ANSWER IS, BECAUSE WEIRD-LOOKING GALAXIES ARE INTERESTING AND

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,620
WE'VE POINTED TELESCOPES AT THEM FOR A LONG TIME

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,029
AND IF YOU PUT THE TELESCOPE ELSEWHERE, YOU SEE THE

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,160
MASSIVE BLACK HOLES THERE, TOO.

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,661
I CAN GO ON FOR QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS.

00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:57,279
THE SCIENTIST IN QUESTION IS HALLTON HARP AND I

00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
WOULD LOVE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,059
THIS WAY OF THINKING IS ALMOST THE OPPOSITE OF

00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,319
READING.

00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:07,100
IF YOU'RE READING A TEXT, USUALLY IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO DECEIVE YOU.

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,410
IT WAS PROBABLY BUILT FOR YOU TO READ IT.

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,619
THE AUTHOR ISN'T ACTIVELY TRYING TO BE MISLEADING OR CONFUSING OR ANYTHING ELSE.

00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:17,361
BUT CODE IS NOT BUILT FOR YOU TO READ IT, AND I

00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:20,439
REALIZE THAT THIS IS A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENT.

00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,920
AND I CURRENTLY WORK WITH AND HAVE WORKED WITH

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,579
BEFORE A LOT OF GREAT PROGRAMMERS WHO SET OUT

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,260
WITH GREAT INTENTIONS AND HAVE GOOD SKILLS AND

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:35,449
THE CODE IS REALLY READABLE AND CLEAN AND AWESOME, AND THEN REALITY HITS IN SOME MANNER.

00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,999
YOU EITHER HAVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS, YOU HAVE

00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:41,809
TO GET PERFORMANCE UP OR YOU HAVE DEADLINES OR

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,749
YOU HAVE ED CASES THAT YOU HAVE TO HANDLE AND

00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,369
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE ALL THREE OF THOSE AT THE SAME

00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,720
TIME AND SO THE CODE ENDS UP ARE NOT BEING AS

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,749
CLEAN AS YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.

00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,180
SO WHAT DOES ITS LOOK LIKE FOR YOU TO THINK OF

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,930
YOURSELF AS AN EXPERT OBSERVE JURY OF YOUR CODE

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,089
BASE.

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:03,399
IT FREES YOU UP TO BE MORE TARGETED, TO LOOK ACROSS HISTORY AND SEE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,399
STRUCTURE.

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,680
SO LET'S LOOK AT SOME SPECIFIC TOOLS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THAT.

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,329
ONE GREAT TOOL FOR DIGGING INTO THE PYTHON CODE

00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:11,329
BASE IS THE INSPECT MODULE.

00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:15,190
THIS TAKES YOU RIGHT TO THE SOURCE CODES OF ANYTHING THAT'S IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON WITHOUT

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,629
YOU HAVING TO DO A TON OF SEARCHING.

00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:23,709
HERE I'M LOOKING AT THE SOURCE CODE FOR RANDOM.CHOICE, WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE A ONE-LINER

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,610
SO THE WAY THIS IS IMPLEMENTED, IT INDEXES INTO A

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,019
SEQUENCE USING RANDOM.RANDOM TIMES THE HECKTH OF

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,410
THE SEQUENCE.

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,750
SO THERE ARE THREE COOL THINGS ABOUT DOING THIS.

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,649
THE FIRST ONE IS, A ONE-LINER THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND IN LESS THAN A MINUTE WHICH IS

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,439
SATISFYING.

00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:41,029
THE SECOND THING, THERE IS A COMMENT THAT SAYS,

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,879
THIS RAISES INDEX ERROR IF THE SEQUENCE IS EMPTY.

00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,110
THIS DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE DOCUMENTATION, ALTHOUGH BE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION GIVEN

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,689
THE WAY THE DOCUMENTATION IS PHRASED.

00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,069
THIS IS GOOD TO KNOW.

00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:53,339
THE THIRD THING IS THAT CHOICE APPEARS TO BE A

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,970
METHOD, TAKE SELF AS A PARAMETER, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE CALLING IT LIKE ITS MODULE LEVEL FUNCTION,

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,319
SO WHAT'S UP WITH THAT, EXACTLY?

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:04,810
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS REALLY INTERESTING AND MAYBE WE CAN COME BACK TO

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,740
THAT IN Q AND A, IF YOU WANT.

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,510
BUT IN UNDER A MINUTE, WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPLEMENTATION, WE CAN LEARN ABOUT AN EDGE

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,829
CASE AND WE FOUND THIS THREADS THAT WE CAN PULL

00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,790
ON IF WE WANT TO PURSUE THIS FURTHER.

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,309
SO IF YOU'VE TRIED TO USE THE INSPECT MODULE BEFORE AND GOT THIS SORT OF MYSTIFYING OUTPUT.

00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,629
THE ONE BUMMER ABOUT THE INSPECT MODULE IN THE

00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,850
STANDARD LIBRARY IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THINGS THAT

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,449
ARE NOT IMPLEMENTSnd PYTHON SO IF YOU CALL ON

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,480
A BUILT-IN OR SOMETHING ELSE IMPLEMENTnd C, IT FALLS DOWN.

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,249
AND YOU CAN'T TELL IF SOMETHING'S IMPLEMENTED IN

00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:41,680
PYTHON OR C AHEAD OF TIME WITHOUT JUST KNOWING.

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,970
SO A FRIEND OF MINE HAS WRITTEN A TOOL CALLED C

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,839
INSPECT, WHICH IS A GREAT HACK THAT MAKES INSPECT

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,369
WORK FOR ALL C-IMPLEMENTED CODES AND HERE IS A

00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,079
LINK TO THAT.

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,689
I THINK IT'S NOT COMPLETELY POLISHED AT THIS POINT BUT VERY FINE, WORKS A SURPRISING AMOUNT

00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,089
OF TIME AND I ALSO TAKE A LOT OF PLEASURE IN

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,779
MY PYTHON REBEL SUDDENLY SPITTING C-CODE AT ME.

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,709
IF YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT, HERE'S THE LINK.

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,190
SO ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN BE AN EXPERT OBSERVER IS

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,850
TO LOOK AT HISTORY.

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,459
YOU HAVE THE FULL HISTORY OF THE PYTHON CODE BASE

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,740
AVAILABLE TO YOU SO YOU CAN USE EARLY CODE TO

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,079
UNDERSTAND THE CODES YOU'RE LOOKING AT TODAY AND

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,759
THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN PYTHON.

00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,959
PYTHON HISTORICALLY HAS HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING REALLY CLEAN AND READABLE C-CODE, SO

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,269
YOU CAN SIT DOWN WITH, SAY, THE INTERPRETER AND

00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:29,139
FOLLOW ALONG WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AHEALED OF TIME.

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,319
AND DECADES LATER, THAT THE LESS TRUE THAN IT

00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,920
USED TO BE, AND TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,311
MOST OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT THERE IS SOME OPTIMIZATION THAT'S GOING TO SPEED UP THE

00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:40,340
EXECUTION OF EVERYONE'S PYTHON AT THE COST OF

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,810
MAKING THE INTERPRETER MORE COMPLEX, THAT IS

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,300
ALMOST ALWAYS THE RIGHT DECISION TO MAKE.

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,589
BUT SO TODAY THE RESULT IS THE INTERPRETER IS

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,100
MUCH HARDER TO GET A FOOTHOLD ON THAN TEN YEARS

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,939
AGO, THAT'S THE REALITY, BUT YOU ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE COLD IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,971
YOU CAN START YOUR EXPLORATION IN AN EARLIER VERSION, YOU CAN TAKE A FIELD TRIP TO THE

00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,009
LAND WHERE PYTHON WAS REALLY CLEAN AND READABLE

00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:05,860
C. CLOSELILY RELATED TO HISTORY IS LOOKING AT

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,079
CHANGE LOGS.

00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,680
FOR PYTHON IN PARTICULAR, WHICH IS USES MERE CURE

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,429
Y'ALL, YOU CAN USE THIS WOULD BE, THIS WILL GIVE

00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,160
A PATCH TO INTRODUCE THE PARTICULAR LINE OF CODES

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,620
AND THE AUTHOR AND COMMIT MESSAGE AND SO ON.

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,579
THIS IS REALLY USEFUL TO BE UNDERSTANDING THE

00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,579
CONTEXT IN WHICH THE CODES WAS INTRODUCED.

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,610
WAS THIS LINE OF CODE PART OF A BUG FIX OR PART

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:29,529
OF A NEW FEATURE, WAS IT PART OF REFACTORING, REARRANGE THINGS AND LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:34,800
PATCH CAN OFTEN BE AN INSTRUCTIVE EXERCISE.

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,630
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO LOOK AT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CODE.

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,269
AND FOR PYTHON THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS

00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,540
WE CAN LOOK AT THE CODES.

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,590
THERE'S THE SOURCE CODE BUT ALSO AT THE AST OR

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,720
YOU CAN LOOK WHERE THE GRAMMAR IS DEFINED OR LOOK

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,709
AT THE BYTECODE INTERPRETER, AND SOMETIMES ONE OF

00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,139
THESE VIEWS WILL BE MORE ILLUMINATING THAN THE

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,019
ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE.

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,430
TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT, THIS IS A GREAT BIT

00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,610
OF PYTHON TRIVIA COURTESY OF A COLLEAGUE OF MINE

00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,610
AT DROPBOX.

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,170
DOES ANYONE WANT TO TAKE A GUESS FOR WHAT THIS

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,949
EVALUATES TO?

00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:05,040
THIS SAYS FALSE IS FALSE IS FALSE.

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,279
I'M HEAR A LOT OF FALSES.

00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,601
ANYONE WANT TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY FALSE?

00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,639
>> FALSE IS FALSE IS...

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,639
[ Audio Indiscernible ] >> SO FALSE IS FALSE IS TRUE, TRUE IS FALSE

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,029
IS FALSE, THEREFORE, FALSE.

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,829
BASICALLY PARSING LIKE THIS, TOTALLY REASONABLE GUESS.

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,050
[ Laughter ] IN FACT, ADDING PARENTHESES TO THIS EXPRESSION

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,679
CHANGES IT COMPLETELY.

00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,679
WOOPS.

00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,379
I SEE WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,239
SO IN FACT THIS VALUE IS TRUE.

00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,239
SORRY.

00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,240
THIS EVALUATES TO TRUE.

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,720
AND THE REASON WHY IT DOES THAT IS BECAUSE THIS

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,860
IS IN FACT A TURNER COMPARISON OPERATION -- RETURN RATE COMPARISON OPERATION, WHICH YOU

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,649
CAN SEE HERE IF I HADN'T SCREWED UP THE SYNTAX.

00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,350
THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME CODE AS A LESS THAN B

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,160
LESS THAN C. I SEE A LOT OF SKEPTICAL FACES, THAT'S TOTALLY

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,880
REASONABLE SO LET'S LOOK AT THE BYTECODE.

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,120
SO HERE IS FALSE IS FALSE IS FALSE.

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,589
DON'T BLINK WHILE I CHANGE THE SLIDE.

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,529
HERE IS A LESS THAN B LESS THAN C. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,730
ABOUT BYTECODE TO SEE THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,730
STRUCTURE.

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,850
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO LOOKING AT THIS AT

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,220
ALL, IT LEAPS OFF THE PAGE AND SO WE CAN USE THIS

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,449
INTERNAL VIEW TO BECOME MUCH MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT

00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:22,470
THE WAY THE COLD BEHAVES.

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,630
I MENTION THE MODEL IS CORRECT OR AS IT TURNS OUT

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,339
BASICALLY HAVING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM GUESS THE

00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:28,339
WRONG ANSWER.

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,399
BUT HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,829
I DID THIS, TOOK THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS.

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,230
THE OTHER THING THAT'S KIND OF FUN IS WE CAN SEE

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,079
THAT COMPARISON OPERATORS ARE PARAMETERIZED, I'LL

00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,579
LEAVE THAT AS A LITTLE NUGGET TO COME BACK TO.

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,100
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SECOND STRATEGY EXPERIMENTATION.

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,180
SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LEAVING CODE SCIENTIFICALLY AND THE TWO EXAMPLES SO FAR

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,181
ARE NATURALISTISM AND ASTRONOMY AND THOUGHT TWO

00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:55,639
THINGS HAVE IN COMMON IS IT'S HARD TO DO EXPERIMENTS.

00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,779
BUT WE'RE PROGRAMMERS SO WE DON'T SUFFER UNDER THIS RESTRICTION.

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,579
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS ABOUT LEARNING ABOUT UNFAMILIAR CODES BASE IN FRONT OF YOU, OTHER

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,850
THAN JUST LOOKING AT IT DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:11,310
YOU CAN RUN EXPERIMENTS, YOU CAN MAKE HYPOTHESES AND TEST THOSE HYPOTHESES.

00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,280
AND ONE WAY YOU CAN TEST YOUR HYPOTHESES IS WITH

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
MEASUREMENTS.

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,670
THERE ARE A TON OF DIFFERENT MEASURING TOOLS AVAILABLE, ONE SIMPLE ONE IS TIME IT FOR

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,900
MEASURING THE SPEED OF CODE SNIPPETS.

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,430
IN THIS EXAMPLE, I'M TESTING WHETHER IT IS FASTER

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:28,020
TO CALL THE METHOD SORT OR CALL THE BUILT-IN SORTED ON A LIST.

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,770
THERE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE IN DAVID

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:35,900
BEASLEY'S TALK YESTERDAY, WHERE HE WAS TIMING EXECUTION OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF CONCURRENT

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,300
CODE, AND THROUGH JUST LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,900
MAKE REQUESTS IN A LOOP AND MEASURING HOW MANY

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,510
REQUESTS PER SECOND HE COULD GET, HE LED US TO AN

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,950
INTERESTING PIECE OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,990
GIL PRIORITIZES TASKS THAT I THINK IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,890
IT TO DO AND SO JUST DOING THE SIMPLE MEASUREMENT

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,060
AND HAVING A THEORY FOR HOW THE GIL SHOULD BE

00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,040
DOING PRIORITIZATION, WE CAN ACTUALLY TEST THAT.

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,930
I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THIS SORT

00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,760
OF EXPERIMENTATION TO HAVE A HYPOTHESIS THAT YOU'RE TESTING.

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,900
OTHERWISE, IT'S PRETTY EASY TO KIND OF ACCUMULATE A LOT OF NUMBERS THAT DON'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,390
OR TELL YOU ANYTHING NEW. AND I DO WANT TO SAY, PLEASE DON'T TIME THINGS

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,420
AND THEN GO DO THINGS THAT WAY ALWAYS IRRESPECTIVELY OF STYLE.

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,310
THIS SORT OF MINUSCULE TIMING OPTIMIZATION IS

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:28,670
ALMOST NEVER A GOOD GUIDE FOR HOW YOU SHOULD PHRASE A LINE OF CODE.

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,910
ANOTHER GREAT WAY TO RUN EXPERIMENTS IS WITH TESTS, SO YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF, I'M READING

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,600
THIS CODE BASE AND I THINK THIS PARTICULAR VARIANT ALWAYS HOLDS SO WRITE A TEST THAT

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,390
PROVES THAT OR THAT SHOWS THAT FOR A NUMBER OF CASES

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,800
FEEL THEN YOU CAN BUILD UP THESE SMALL BLOCKS OF

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,690
KNOWLEDGE INTO A MUCH MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM.

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,520
THIS WILL PROBABLY BE SLOW THE FIRST TIME THAT

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,870
YOU DO IT AND IT DOES REINTRODUCE THE TOOLING AND

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,600
INSTALLATION HELL THAT WE HOPED TO AVOID BUT I

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,010
THINK IT'S WORTH IT AND THE REASON WHY I EMPHASIZE THIS IS NOT BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,750
OCCURRED TO ANY OF TO YOU WRITE TESTS BUT BECAUSE

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,780
I THINK MY THRESHOLD FOR WHEN YOU START WRITING TESTS IS MUCH LOWER THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD.

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,320
I THINK IF YOU'RE SPENDING MORE THAN LIKE AN HOUR

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,400
WITH CPYTHON, YOU SHOULD TRY WRITING A TEST.

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,040
AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WRITE A FORMAL

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
TEST, EITHER.

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,250
YOU CAN, FOR EXAMPLE, USE THE FUNCTION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT OR, LIKE, REMOVE A PIECE

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,100
THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT AND SEE IF IT FALLS OVER IN

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,880
THE WAY THAT YOU EXPECT IT TO.

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,730
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY AM OFTEN

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,730
BAD AT.

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,060
I REALLY WANT TO -- I OFTEN WANT TO HAVE A VERY

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,650
COMPLETE MENTAL MODEL OF THE SYSTEM BEFORE I

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,690
NOTHING AND START MAKING CHANGES, AND THIS IS AN

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,270
INEFFICIENT DECISION, LIKE ALMOST EVERY TIME.

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,000
IT WOULD BE MUCH FASTER TORE ME TO START MAKING CHANGES, WRITING TEST ATTENTION, BUILD UP

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,110
MY MODEL ALONG THE WAY AND THAT'S CODES I PROBABLY

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,750
WON'T KEEP, I WILL END UP BUILDING THE MENTAL MODEL, THROWING OUT THE CODE AND MAYBE MAKING

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,350
A CHANGE IF THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,360
BUT, AGAIN, SINCE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CONTRIBUTING OR ANYTHING TODAY, YOU SHOULD

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,810
-- YOU CAN TAKE YOUR COPY OF CPYTHON AND MAKE IT

00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,550
DO WHATEVER YOU CARE ABOUT.

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,330
IT'S JUST TO INCREASE YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND THEN

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,520
THROW IT AWAY.

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,070
SO LET'S PUT THIS ALL BACK TOGETHER AND I WANT TO

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,690
LEAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT STRATEGIES AND/OR THE RANDOM MODULE IF YOU'RE

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,690
INTERESTED.

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,060
WHEN YOU START TO ZIG INTO THE PYTHON CODE BASE,

00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,120
DON'T READS IT, INTERACT WITH IT IN SOME OTHER WAY.

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,540
I LIKE DIGGING AROUND IN PYTHON SOURCE, I FIND IT

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,770
DEEPLY GOOD FOR UNDERSTANDING IT.

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,270
I HOPE YOU DO THIS IN A REALLY INTERACTIVE AND

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,080
PLAYFUL WAY AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS THAT YOU HAVE YOUR

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,110
OWN COPY OF THE CODE IN FRONT OF YOU, AND YOU

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,280
CAN POKE IT AND PRODUCT IT AND RUN EXPERIMENTS

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,990
AND MAKE SILLY OR ILL-ADVISED CHANGES AND SOME

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,100
OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND OBJECTIVELY REALLY FUN

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,050
PROJECTS THAT I'VE HAD WERE EXTREMELY ILL-ADVISED.

00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,700
AND THEY WERE GREAT WAYS TO LEARN.

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,080
SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO OUT AND DOWNLOAD A COPY

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,110
OF PYTHON SOURCE, IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE ONE

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,500
AND START NOT READING IT.

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,740
THANK YOU.

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:07,210
[ Applause ] 01:49:16>> AUDIENCE: HI.

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,000
I CONSIDER MYSELF A FAIRLY JADED OLD PYTHON PROGRAMMER SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS BECAUSE

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,430
I LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY.

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,700
MY QUESTION, THOUGH, IS SO WHY DOES CHOICE LOOK

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,300
LIKE A METHOD?

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,820
>> IF ONLY I HAD A SLIDE FOR THAT.

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,830
[ Laughter ] SO THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING MODEL, I THINK.

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,730
SO BASICALLY THE CHOICE IS IMPLEMENTED AS A

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,380
METHOD ON THE RANDOM CLASS AND WHEN YOU IMPORT THE RANDOM MODULE FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,110
GET AN INSTANCE OF THAT CLASS AND THEN IN THAT MODULE,

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,680
IT REBINDS ALL OF THE METHODS AS FUNCTION NAMES,

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,210
SO YOU SEE LIKE C EQUALS INSTANCE DOT SAEED AND

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,260
RANDOM AND SO ON.

00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:54,120
THERE IS A COMMENTS THAT EXPLAINS THE RATIONALE, WHICH SAYS THAT YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:01,580
FOR THE PYTHON PROGRAMMER TO RE-SEED THE RANDOM MODULE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INIT

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,630
MODULE OF THIS RANDOM CLASS, SO WE DO WANT TO PRESERVE

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,450
THAT, SO RANDOM.CHOICE I THINK IS MOST OFTEN USED

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,080
IN TEXT ADVENTURE GAMES FOR BEGINNERS SO WE DON'T

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,470
WANT TO IMPOST THIS COST ON NEW PYTHON PROGRAMMERS OR PROGRAMMERS WHO DON'T NEED

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,890
SPECIAL CONTROL OVER THE RANDOM MODULE.

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,130
SO THAT'S THE WAY THIS IS IMPLEMENTED AND THE

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,620
NAMES ARE REBOUND AND DOUBLE UNDERSCORE ALL IS

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,840
DEFINED IN THE METHODS SO YOU DON'T GET KIND OF

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,190
JUNK THAT DOESN'T BELONG THERE WHEN YOU DO A STAR

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,190
IMPORT.

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,650
OTHER QUESTIONS?

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,310
ALL RIGHT.

00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,970
THANK YOU.

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,309
