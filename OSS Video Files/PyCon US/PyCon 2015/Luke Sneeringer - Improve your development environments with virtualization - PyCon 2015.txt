LIMB'S TALK ON REACT.JS IS CANCELED.

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,359
WE HAVE A REPLACEMENT TALK. LUKE SNEERINGER IS GONNA GIVE A

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,359
TALK IN THREE MINUTES. >> MOON LIMB'S TALK ON REACT.JS

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,359
IS CANCELED. LUKE SNEERINGER IS GONNA BE HERE

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,359
ANY MINUTE. SO JUST HANG ON.

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,359
>> CHECK, CHECK. HEY, I AM ON.

00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,359
HELLO, EVERYONE. I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,210
HOW TO IMPROVE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS WITH

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,440
VIRTUALIZATION. AS A MINOR SIDE NOTE, I WILL

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,430
ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT DOESN'T WORK.

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,780
I'LL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE SLIDE LAYOUTS WITH

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,080
SHORTER TITLES, BECAUSE IF IT TAKES THREE LINES, IT REALLY

00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,800
DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD, SOMETHING I LEARNED AS I WAS

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,070
MAKING THE SLIDES FOR THIS PRESENTATION.

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,510
AS A QUICK NOTE, I AM NOT THE SPEAKER ON THE SCHEDULE.

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,680
I AM NOT MOON LIMB. THOSE RESPONSIBLE HAVE BEEN

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,310
SACKED AND A NEW TALK HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER.

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,570
WHO I ACTUALLY AM, I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER AT ANSIBLE.

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,240
WE DO SERVER ORCHESTRATION. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF US.

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,250
THERE WAS A TALK ON ANSIBLE YESTERDAY.

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,740
I'M MARRIED TO MEGAN, WHO IS SITTING IN THE SECOND ROW AND IS

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,260
ALSO THE BEST WIFE EVER, AND I LIVE IN TEXAS.

00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,350
THERE WE GO. OKAY, SO I'M GONNA TALK REAL

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,170
FAST ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE, WHAT IS -- WHERE ARE WE?

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,890
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE?

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,470
SO THE LANDSCAPE. SADLY, IT'S NOT THAT ONE.

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,511
DIFFERENT KIND OF LANDSCAPE. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE STARTED A

00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:52,430
NEW TECH JOB IN THE LAST FEW YEARS?

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,870
ALMOST EVERYBODY. OKAY.

00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,799
SO YOU GO TO YOUR NEW JOB AND WHAT IS YOUR FIRST WEEK LOOK

00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,670
LIKE? IT PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE GETTING

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,530
YOUR COMPUTER, FILLING OUT YOUR H.R. FORMS AND AT SOME POINT,

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,000
YOU ARE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON A PROJECT.

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,989
AND YOU GO TO YOUR COWORKERS, PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY THERE,

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:20,920
AND YOU SAY, I NEED TO SET UP A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,590
NEW PROJECT. AND WHAT YOU OFTEN GET KIND OF

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,269
LOOKS LIKE THE HOMESTAR RUNNER VERSION OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,290
LIKE, "YOU WILL NEED A FEW DAYS TO GET YOUR DEVELOPMENT

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,940
ENVIRONMENT UP." OR... "OH, DOCUMENTATION?

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,840
WE NEED THAT?" IT'S JUST BAD.

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,750
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH TIME CAN BE WASTED AS YOU TRY TO JUST GET

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,500
GOING. AND THEN YOU GO AND LOOK AT YOUR

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,040
GITHUB TICKETS, AND SOMEONE SAYS, IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE.

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,060
AND IT JUST -- NONE OF THESE THINGS REALLY WANT TO MAKE YOU

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,810
BLAST OFF FIREWORKS AND SING THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS AND BE LIKE,

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,230
YEAH, THIS IS AWESOME! THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS SHOULD BE.

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,879
AND SO WE SHOULD FIX IT. WE SHOULD MAKE IT BETTER.

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,129
AND WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS,

00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:25,620
THERE'S A FEW -- THERE'S A FEW STANDARDS THINGS THAT IT SEEMS

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,739
LIKE WE OUGHT TO HAVE FOR THINGS TO BE WORKING WELL.

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,989
WE SHOULD BE HAVING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS THAT MIRROR

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,290
PRODUCTION AS MUCH AS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE.

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,790
IT SHOULD BE THAT OUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS LOOK

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,610
AND RUN A WHOLE LOT LIKE OUR SERVERS, OUR PRODUCTION

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,810
MACHINES. IF WE'RE MAKING A DESKTOP

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,010
APPLICATION OR A SCRIPT OR AN EXECUTABLE OR WHATEVER, THERE

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,770
SHOULDN'T BE ANY FACTORS THAT MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT RUN

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,420
DIFFERENTLY, EXCEPT FOR THINGS THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY

00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,629
DEVELOPER-SPECIFIC, AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT.

00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,330
IT SHOULD BE LOW COST. IF YOU DO SOMETHING TO SCREW UP

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,790
YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST BLOW

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,090
IT AWAY AND MAKE A NEW ONE. AND THE LAST THING, HAS ANYONE

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,730
EVER TRIED TO DEVELOP ON MACHINES THAT ARE EXACTLY LIKE

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,680
YOUR PRODUCTION MACHINES? YOU CAN GO MAKE A CLOUD SERVER

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,000
THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE YOUR PRODUCTION MACHINE, CAN BE IN

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,060
THE SAME PLACE, YOU KNOW, NYC2 OR WHATEVER, WHATEVER LOCATION

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,850
ON THE SAME PROVIDER, IT CAN LOOK EXACTLY LIKE IT, BUT YOU

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,130
KNOW WHAT? IT REALLY, REALLY, REALLY STARTS

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:40,099
TO SUCK TO DEVELOP THAT WAY. I'M GOING TO SSHN, AND THEN I'M

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,949
GOING TO DO ALL OF MY DEVELOP IN VIM AND KEEP EVERYTHING TOGETHER

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,960
IN LS, AND IT'S JUST NOT REALLY VERY FUN.

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,939
AND OF COURSE EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU MAKE A CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO

00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:58,960
RIGHT QUIT OUT OF VIM, OR WHATEVER SERVER YOU HAPPEN TO BE

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,590
USING, IF IT'S A SCRIPT, THEN IT'S A MATTER OF RUNNING IN THE

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,539
ENVIRONMENT AND RESETTING YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,990
AND WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW.

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,930
WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S THE MEME.

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,710
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF DOING THIS?

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,199
AND AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUESTION, I REALLY CAME UP WITH

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,639
THREE THINGS: PORTABILITY, CONSISTENCY, AND REUSABILITY.

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,650
I'M GONNA TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT EACH ONE.

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,330
PORTABILITY, THAT'S THAT NEW HIRE SITUATION.

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,629
YOU COME AS A NEW HIRE TO A NEW COMPANY -- WOULD BE NICE IF YOU

00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,589
COULD JUST HAVE A SETUP, AND IT WOULD JUST WORK.

00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,529
AND PORTABILITY IS WHAT GIVES YOU THAT.

00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,410
IT'S, YES, WE ALREADY WROTE THIS CODE TO SET UP A DEVELOPMENT

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,169
ENVIRONMENT, AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS INSTALL THIS PROGRAM AND

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,689
RUN THIS. AND RUN THIS THING.

00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,899
AND YOU, TOO, CAN START ACTUALLY WORKING.

00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,189
CONSISTENCY, WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT.

00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,009
CONSISTENCY IS, THERE SHOULDN'T BE DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE IT SO

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:12,559
THAT IT WORKS WHEN I'M WRITING IN DEVELOPMENT AND BREAKS WHEN

00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,990
IT'S RUNNING ON PRODUCTION MACHINES, WHEN IT'S THE THING

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,520
THAT THE CUSTOMER'S USING. AND REUSABILITY IS, I SHOULD BE

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,479
ABLE TO DO THIS OFTEN. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO BLOW UP A

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,009
BOX AND MAKE A NEW ONE. I SHOULD BE ABLE GET INTO A

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,340
PRISTINE STATE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE HACKING ON THINGS, YOU

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,909
GET OUT OF A PRISTINE STATE. YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:41,119
DIFFERENTLY TO SEE WHAT WORKS. REUSABILITY LETS YOU PULL BACK

00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:45,159
INTO A PRISTINE STATE. AND THIS CONCEPT IS REALLY

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,080
USEABLE EVERYWHERE. IT'S USEABLE -- MOST OF MY

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,150
EXAMPLES ARE ON SERVER SIDE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,919
WHERE I'M THE MOST FAMILIAR, BUT, REALLY, THIS ISN'T A

00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,379
CONCEPT THAT'S RESTRICTED TO THAT.

00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,749
A DESKTOP APPLICATION CAN RUN OFF THIS TYPE OF APPLICATION.

00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:02,389
THERE ISN'T REALLY A CASE WHERE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,249
MAKE SENSE. AND SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW

00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:12,089
TO USE THEM. SO A QUICK BIT ON TOOLS.

00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,880
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF TOOLS TO DO THIS KIND OF THING, AND WHAT

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,249
EXAMPLE COULD I HAVE, I PICKED A COUPLE TO EXPLAIN.

00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,110
BUT I AM NOT TRYING TO PUSH THAT THIS IS THE ONLY TOOLS TO USE.

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,520
I'M TRYING TO PUSH THE CONCEPT. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE AT 10 MINUTES

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,589
INTO THE TALK AND I REALLY ONLY TALKED ABOUT CONCEPTUAL --

00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:36,169
TRYING TO SELL THE CONCEPT TO YOU.

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,689
PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR TOOL FOR ACTUALLY DOING

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,819
VIRTUALIZATION FOR DEVELOPMENT WORK SPECIFICALLY IS A TOOL

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,059
CALLED VAGRANT. VAGRANT IS A WRAPPER AROUND

00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,229
OTHER TOOLS, MOST NOTABLY VIRTUALBOX AND VMWARE.

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:54,460
THERE'S A COUPLE OF COMPETITORS. THERE'S ONE CALLED BOX CLIFF AND

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,919
ANOTHER CALLED VORTEX. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FORMER

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,889
OF THOSE WHEN I WROTE THESE SLIDES, SO I ENDED UP WITH A

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,119
SLIDE WHERE EVERY SINGLE THING JUST STARTS WITH A V, WELL,

00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,080
WHICH, FINE. IT'S CONVENIENT.

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,249
I FIGURED I WOULD GET AT LEAST A GOOD LAUGH FOR THAT.

00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:18,279
THANK YOU IN THE BACK. THERE'S A LOT MORE PROVISIONING

00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,999
TOOLS AVAILABLE. SO THERE WERE SEVERAL TALKS

00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,959
YESTERDAY ON VARIOUS DIFFERENT PROVISIONING TOOLS.

00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,479
JAMES GAVE A TALK ON ANSIBLE. NOAH LAST YEAR GAVE A TALK ON

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,339
CHEF. THERE WAS A TALK THIS YEAR ON

00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,589
DOCKER. THERE WAS A TALK LAST YEAR ON

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,890
SALTSTACK. THE PURPOSE OF A PROVISIONING IS

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,969
TO GET THINGS INTO A PARTICULAR STATE.

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,050
I'M GONNA COME BACK TO THIS IN JUST A MOMENT BUT JUST SAY THERE

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,560
ARE SEVERAL TOOLS TO USE. YOU ARE HOPEFULLY ALREADY USING

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,130
THIS CONCEPT IN YOUR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS FOR ACTUALLY GIVING

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,710
YOUR CODE TO THE ULTIMATE CLIENT, TO THE ULTIMATE

00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,899
CUSTOMER. AND SO, REALLY, IT SHOULD JUST

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,829
BE A MATTER OF TAKING THIS AND MAKING IT USEFUL FOR DEVELOPMENT

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:07,120
AS WELL. I'M OPERATING UNDER THE

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,959
ASSUMPTION THAT MANY, IF NOT MOST OF YOU, HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN

00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,730
INTO THE WORLD OF PROVISIONING FOR PRODUCTION USE.

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,930
IF YOU HAVEN'T, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,449
TALKS THAT WERE GIVEN YESTERDAY AND LAST YEAR ON THIS TOPIC,

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,190
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN BARELY

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,740
SCRATCH THE SURFACE. AND BY THE WAY, THE ONLY REASON

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,490
THE KING OF TOWN IS ON THIS SLIDE IS BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,040
NEEDED A PICTURE. SO AGAIN, TRYING TO PITCH

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,560
PROVISIONING, THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONING IS TO GET A MACHINE

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,430
INTO A DEFINED STATE. IT SAYS I DON'T REALLY CARE

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,870
ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER ASPECTS OF A MACHINE; HOWEVER, THESE THINGS

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,790
ARE THE THINGS THAT A MACHINE MUST HAVE.

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,420
THIS IS THE STATE IT MUST BE IN. HOW DO WE DEFINE THE STATE IN

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,860
PRESENCE OF THE CODE TO RUN? PRESENCE OF OBJECTS INSTALLED?

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,490
CERTAIN CONFIGURATION BEING SET, ALL THOSE THINGS.

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,690
IT SHOULD MOSTLY MATCH HOW YOU DEFINE STATE IN PRODUCTION.

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,940
AND THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO GET A LOT OF VALUE OUT OF WHAT I AM

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,440
TALKING ABOUT TODAY, PROBABLY YOU ALREADY NEED TO HAVE

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,740
PRODUCTION PROVISIONING DONE. IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,490
HAVE DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONING IF YOU DON'T HAVE PRODUCTION

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,660
PROVISIONING, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IF YOU ARE JUST TRYING

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,959
TO GET INTO THIS WORLD, USING DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONING CAN BE

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:32,970
A VERY LOW RISK, LOW COST WAY TO GET YOUR FEET WET, AND THEN

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,990
AFTER THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED AND WORKING, THEN IT CAN BE

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,639
PORTED TO PRODUCTION. THAT IS A VALID AND SENSIBLE WAY

00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,870
TO GO. SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO JUST RUN A

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,839
GENERIC SERVER SIDE APPLICATION? WELL, YOU PROBABLY NEED THREE

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,620
BASIC THINGS. YOU NEED TO INSTALL SOFTWARE

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,240
THAT'S NOT PYTHON BASED. YOUR WEB SERVER, IF YOU'RE A WEB

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,050
PERSON, YOUR, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER ELSE.

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,610
YOUR FIREWALL, YOUR BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,589
YOU PROBABLY NEED TO INSTALL PYTHON PACKAGES BECAUSE ONE OF

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:14,560
THE REASONS WHY YOU USE PYTHON IS NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,459
AND THEN CONFIGURING ALL OF THE ABOVE IS THE LAST THING YOU NEED

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,370
TO DO. PRETTY MUCH NO MATTER WHAT YOUR

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,000
APPLICATION LOOKS LIKE, YOU PROBABLY ARE DOING ALL OF THESE

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,060
THINGS. EVEN IF YOU'RE CREATING A

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,660
DESKTOP APPLICATION OR A SCRIPT, YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING ALL OF

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:35,560
THESE THINGS. AS FAR AS VIRTUALIZATION IS

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,889
CONCERNED, IT'S REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, EASY TO MAKE A CLOUD

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,540
SERVER AND PROVISION IT. THERE'S A BUNCH OF THEM.

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,959
THAT WILL LET YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,550
I'LL PAY $5 A MONTH FOR IT AND LOOK, I HAVE ROOT ON A VERY TINY

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,160
BOX. AND I CAN DO ALL MY DEVELOPMENT

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,990
ON THAT. BUT IT'S REALLY PAINFUL TO

00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,000
ACTUALLY DO WORK ON THOSE THINGS.

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,850
IT CAN BE DONE. YOU CAN USE NFS TO SYNC FOLDERS

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,149
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. IT CAN BE DONE.

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,560
BUT IT'S NOT FUN. IT'S PRETTY PAINFUL.

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,379
AND THE PROBLEM IS, WORKING IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS IS

00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,540
PAINFUL. AND IT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,630
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE HACKING IN PRODUCTION.

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,470
BUT IF WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THESE PRODUCTION CONCEPTS AND

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,829
PORT THEM TO A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, USING ENVIRONMENT

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,690
KIND OF IN A DOUBLE WAY THERE, THEN WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,499
PAIN. AND IN REALITY, AS MUCH AS I

00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,670
SAID THAT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD MIRROR PRODUCTION AS MUCH AS

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,480
POSSIBLE, THERE MUST BE SOME DIFFERENCES.

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,060
REALLY, AT LEAST THREE. ONE, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CODE

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,939
LOCALLY. BECAUSE UNLESS YOU ARE VERY,

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:55,970
VERY LOOSE ABOUT WHAT YOUR PERSONAL, YOU KNOW, PREFERENCE

00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,019
ENVIRONMENT LOOKS LIKE, YOU PROBABLY ARE VERY PICKY ABOUT

00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,389
HAVING YOUR MACROS SET UP IN A PARTICULAR WAY.

00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,660
AND SO YOU NEED TO WORK LOCALLY. YOU NEED YOUR DEVELOPMENT

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,040
ENVIRONMENT TO KNOW THAT IT'S A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,870
AN ERROR THAT GIVES YOU LOTS OF INFORMATION INCLUDING YOUR

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,259
DATABASE CREDENTIALS AND WHATNOT IS REALLY BAD FOR A PRODUCTION

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:22,220
SYSTEM, BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR A DEVELOPMENT ONE.

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,589
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION GO TO THE LOGS OR TO SOMEBODY'S EMAIL.

00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,960
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM, YOU WANT IT

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,560
IN YOUR FACE WITH AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE SO YOU

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,529
CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,550
AND THE LAST THING IS RESPONSIVENESS OF TOOLS TO

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,940
CHANGES. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SAVE A NEW

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,690
FILE, YOU WANT YOUR SERVERS TO RELOAD AND GET THOSE CHANGES.

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,230
AND THERE'S A FEW OTHER NICE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD TO HAVE.

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,190
FLEXIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTS. IF YOU'RE WORKING ON A TOOL THAT

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,149
RUNS IN MULTIPLE STATES, SAY, AN EXECUTABLE THAT NEEDS TO RUN IN

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:57,389
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF LINUX, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:00,930
SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS TO BE ABLE

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,920
COVER. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,860
VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN EVERY NECESSARY DISTRIBUTION.

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,430
AND THE ABILITY TO SHARE. SO I SHOULD SHOW YOU SOME CODE.

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,569
SO FIRST OF ALL, THE TOOLS THAT I'M CHOOSING TO DISCUSS ARE

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:19,410
VAGRANT AND VIRTUALBOX. THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY TOOLS.

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,439
VAGRANT PROJECTS USES A VAGRANT FILE.

00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:25,390
THIS IS SPECIFIC TO DEVELOPMENT. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MIRROR

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,779
AGAINST PRODUCTION, WHICH IS VERY USEFUL, AND IF YOU'RE SMART

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,170
ABOUT THE WAY YOU WRITE YOUR VAGRANT FILE, THERE'S NO REASON

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,209
WHY YOU CAN'T COMMIT IT TO VERSION CONTROL.

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,730
IT DEFINES ONE OR MORE MACHINES, AND IT DEFINES A PROVISIONER.

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,990
A MACHINE IS BASICALLY A VIRTUAL MACHINE THAT IT SHOULD CREATE,

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,279
AND THE PROVISIONER IS A TOOL, THE THIRD-PARTY PROVISIONER THAT

00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,839
YOU'RE GOING TO USE AT YOUR SHOP SUCH AS ANSIBLE OR CHEF OR

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,790
FABRIC OR WHATEVER ELSE. SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT DEFINING A

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,949
MACHINE LOOKS LIKE. I'M NOT GONNA KEEP THIS CODE UP

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,890
ON THE SLIDES FOR A SUPER LONG TIME.

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,080
MOSTLY THIS IS A CONCEPTUAL TALK.

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,740
YOU CAN LOOK AT VAGRANT.COM TO GET THE -- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,809
OPERATING SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO RUN.

00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:16,600
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IP ADDRESS IT'S GONNA HAVE WITHIN OUR LOCAL

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,620
ENVIRONMENT WORLD AND THEN HOW MUCH MEMORY IT'S GOING TO HAVE.

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,180
PROVISIONING LOOKS SIMILAR. I'M GONNA SPEND A LITTLE BIT

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,290
LONGER HERE. SO YOU SAY WHAT PROVISIONER YOU

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,949
NEED TO USE WITH THIS FUNKY RUBY DSL.

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,410
AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS, YOU CAN DO THINGS

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,390
LIKE DEFINE A COUPLE OF EXTRA VARIABLES.

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,370
AND THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN START TO TELL YOUR SYSTEM

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,680
THAT THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BOX. IT SHOULDN'T ACT QUITE LIKE A

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,660
PRODUCTION BOX. NOTICE I HAVE AS PART OF MY

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,319
ANSIBLE EXTRA BARS DEVELOPMENT EQUALS TRUE.

00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,319
WELL, NOW, WHENEVER I'M RUNNING MY ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS, WHICH

00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,420
OBVIOUSLY ARE ABLE TO CREATE A PRODUCTION SYSTEM, ONE OF THE

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,399
THINGS THEY CAN DO IS, IN ANY TEMPLATE, THEY CAN SAY, WELL, IF

00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,589
DEVELOPMENT, DO THIS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING.

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:03,270
I WANT ALL MY PRODUCTION STUFF. I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE WORKING

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,660
THE SAME WAY IT'S WORKING IN PRODUCTION EXCEPT THIS ONE SPOT.

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,480
THIS ONE SPOT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,499
WANT TO SHOOT MYSELF IN THE HEAD OVER THE PAIN.

00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,999
WELL, WHERE DO WE STAND AT THIS POINT?

00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:20,689
WELL, NOW YOU CAN VAGRANT UP AND PROVISION A PRODUCTION MACHINE.

00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,170
AND THEN YOU'RE SAD. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,660
DIFFERENTIATION. MOST LIKELY YOU PROBABLY DON'T

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,790
WANT TO BE SHELLING TO YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT TO DO YOUR

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,350
WORK. BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF PAIN

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,069
THAT YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM. VAGRANT PROVIDES A WAY TO

00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:42,670
SYNCHRONIZE A FOLDER BETWEEN THE HOST MACHINE, YOUR DESKTOP THAT

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,680
YOU'RE SITTING AT, AND YOUR GUEST MACHINE, WHICH IS

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,710
VM.SYNCED FOLDER. SO THIS IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN

00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:56,360
NOW HAVE A LOCAL CODE ON YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS.

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,779
YOU USE WHATEVER EDITOR, IEE TYPE OF THING THAT YOU WANT TO

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,220
USE, AND AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A SAVE, THAT SAVE IS REFLECTED ON

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,339
THE VIRTUAL MACHINE. FOR DEVELOPMENT AWARENESS, THE

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,069
EASIEST WAY I FOUND IS PROVIDE A DEVELOPMENT FLAG TO YOUR

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,520
PROVISIONER, AND THEN IT'S REALLY EASY IN YOUR PROVISIONER

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,110
TOOL, WHEN YOU'RE CONFIGURING YOUR TOOLS SAY I NEED TO

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,539
CONFIGURE THIS TOOL TO BE IN A DEVELOPMENT STATE.

00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,020
THE EXAMPLE I USED IS JUST SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT OF A

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,820
DJANGO SETTINGS FILE. IF I'M IN DEVELOPMENT, THEN I

00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,620
WANT TO SET DEBUG TO TRUE. RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGE RUNS ON

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,470
THE SAME PRINCIPLE. IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE TYPE TOOL,

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,910
MOST OF THEM HAVE MECHANISMS TO RELOAD THEMSELVES IF SOMETHING

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,350
CHANGES. YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN THAT

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,230
CONFIGURATION ON. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR TURNING

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,110
THAT CONFIGURATION ON IS CONFIGURING IT SLIGHTLY

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,270
DIFFERENTLY IF YOU'RE ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT MACHINE RATHER THAN

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,160
YOUR PRODUCTION MACHINE AND MAKE IT RESPOND TO THAT DEVELOPMENT

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,700
STATE. AND THERE'S SEVERAL ADVANTAGES

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,049
TO THINKING THROUGH IT THIS WAY. AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,149
RUNS IN LOTS OF ENVIRONMENTS, VIRTUALIZATION IS GREAT FOR

00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,520
THAT. IF YOU WANT TO TEST HOW YOUR

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,110
SYSTEM WILL RUN IN A LOW MEMORY ENVIRONMENT, VIRTUALIZATION IS

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:15,090
FANTASTIC FOR THAT. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO TEST AND

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:20,409
FIGURE OUT WHAT CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,580
FROM THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO YOUR PROGRAM, VIRTUALIZATION IS

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,549
GREAT FOR THAT. AND IT'S A VERY LOW RISK, LOW

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,960
COMMITMENT WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE AT ANY POINT, YOU CAN JUST

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,460
DESTROY WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND START OVER.

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,640
AND ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND SOME

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,399
MONEY, VAGRANT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO SHARE YOUR BOX WITH

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:47,500
OTHER PEOPLE. SO I'M GONNA COME BACK TO A

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,710
PHILOSOPHICAL POINT THAT I'VE BEEN DRIVING REPEATEDLY, WHICH

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,500
IS DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BEHAVE EXACTLY LIKE PRODUCTION.

00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,390
THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,260
PRODUCTION WHEN POSSIBLE. EXCEPT WHEN IT'S TOO PAINFUL.

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,190
AT WHICH POINT IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT, BUT ONLY THERE.

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,570
AND THE REASON WHY YOU ONLY WANT IT TO BE DIFFERENT THERE IS

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:17,630
BECAUSE ANY DIFFERENCE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR AN INCONSISTENCY

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,820
IN YOUR WORK. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES IT REALLY IS

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,320
TOO PAINFUL AND IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT.

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,990
AND SINCE THIS IS PUT TOGETHER AT GREAT EXPENSE AND AT THE LAST

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,899
MINUTE, THAT'S ALL I HAVE, BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS

00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,270
FOR A FEW MINUTES. I WILL NOTE THAT MORE LUKE

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:40,799
EQUALS LESS GUIDO, AND THEN I WILL TRY TO LET YOU ALL OUT

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:53,150
EARLY. [ Applause ]

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,100
>> IF YOU HAVE A QUESTIONS, PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE.

00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:02,539
AS ALWAYS, YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION.

00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,830
>> SO COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S TOO PAINFUL?

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,399
>> SO THE QUESTION FOR THE VIDEO IS, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S

00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,059
TOO PAINFUL. MY BIGGEST PAIN POINT IN THAT

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,720
KIND OF SITUATION IS THINGS THAT DON'T AUTO RELOAD.

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,120
IT'S REALLY PAINFUL TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE I NEED TO SAVE

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,551
MY FILE, GO RELOAD MY SERVER, RUN THE THING TO CHECK IT, GO

00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:29,530
MAKE A CHANGE, SAVE THE FILE, RELOAD THE SERVER, RUN THE THING

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,279
TO CHECK IT. THAT RELOAD THE SERVER STEP

00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,200
SHOULDN'T BE THERE. THAT'S AN UN-OBVIOUS EXAMPLE.

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,429
ANOTHER ONE IS, I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME GURUS, BUT I

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:42,630
DON'T DO ALL OF MY DAY-TO-DAY EDITING IN SOMETHING THAT WILL

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:50,919
RUN IN A SHELL PRONG. HOWEVER, THAT'S NOT MY PERSONAL

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,429
PREFERENCE. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE MY

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,000
LOCAL DESKTOP TOOLS AGAINST MY VM.

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
YES. >> CAN YOU MAKE A COMMENT ON

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,659
PERFORMANCE OF VAGRANT VERSUS NATIVE?

00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:10,779
>> MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN

00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,970
INTERESTING ENOUGH TO DO PERFORMANCE TESTING ON.

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,450
USUALLY THE -- USUALLY WHAT I'M AFTER IS MAKING IT CLOSER TO MY

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,769
PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. SO MY DESKTOP HAS 32 GIGS OF

00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,460
RAM. WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN ANY

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,700
OF MY SERVERS. SO -- BUT I'M SURE THAT NATIVE

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,600
IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER. BUT I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,720
EXPERIENCE ON HOW MUCH. YES.

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,630
>> SO I KNOW YOU CAN MAP DIRECTORIES FROM OUTSIDE TO

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,919
INSIDE THE VM, LIKE YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY INSIDE THE VAGRANT

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,270
MACHINE SO YOU CAN WORK ON IT LIVE.

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,200
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU NEED TO GO THE OTHER WAY?

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,610
AND THAT WOULD BE INSIDE THE VM? >> SURE, SO THE QUESTION THAT HE

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,090
ASKED IS, WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU NEED TO GO THE OTHER DIRECTION?

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,840
WHAT IF YOU -- WHAT ABOUT THINGS INSIDE THE VM THAT YOU WANT TO

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,980
PULL OUT? THE ANSWER IS THAT THAT GETS

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,260
REALLY TRICKY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN THE OS, BUT

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,020
INSIDE VERSUS OUTSIDE THE VM. YOU CAN'T JUST PULL SOMETHING

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,179
FROM SITE PACKAGES ON TO YOUR MASK.

00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,580
NOW IF IT'S UBUNTU TO UBUNTU, THAT'S BETTER.

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,571
BUT IT'S TRICKY. IT ALSO GETS TRICKY WHEN YOU

00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:26,429
NEED TO RUN SCRIPTS THAT CREATE FILES LIKE, SAY, MAKE

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,900
MIGRATIONS. THAT KIND OF SITUATION CAN GET

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,470
REALLY HAIRY. >> GREAT.

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,320
LET'S THANK LUKE AGAIN FOR THAT LAST-MINUTE SAVE.
