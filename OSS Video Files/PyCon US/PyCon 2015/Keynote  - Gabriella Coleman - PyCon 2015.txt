>> Hello, hello.

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,250
It's getting there.

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,970
Not yet?

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,330
Now?

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,779
Can you hear me?

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,150
Okay.

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,509
Perfect.

00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm just going to jump in.

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:45,449
I'm going to be talking quite a bit about the protests ensemble anonymous, they're fixing

00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,539
my other Mic I'll move out in a second.

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,749
For people that kind of follow anonymous a little bit you might know they might be something

00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:56,839
most politically incorrect activists in the world.

00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:01,839
A little bit of a warning, there will be a little bit of offensive material that comes

00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:03,489
in the talk but it shouldn't be too bad.

00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,909
So, who here has met an anthropologist before?

00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,790
Wow, lot of you guys.

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,040
Well, that's what I am.

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,580
I'm an anthropologist we're not too common -- I'm going to have to stand here.

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,430
Anthropologists are not too common.

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,110
When I tell people like, I don't know, my accountant or my doctor that I'm an anthropologist

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,320
they are usually pretty excited because they think I work in the jungle or with skulls.

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,030
Then I tell them that I work with computer hackers and they get even more confused.

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,790
Then I just kind of drop it.

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,340
But I'm an anthropologist since about 2001 I've worked on computer hackers and geeks.

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,660
My first project was on free software.

00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:54,001
I like to tell people when I'm trying to keep it simple that I study the effect of free

00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,410
software has had on people.

00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:13,170
And as you can see -- [ laughter ]

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,170
The one drug -- [Applause]

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,790
That improves your life.

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,819
And more seriously I did spend five or six years studying it culminated in a book called

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,190
"Coding freedom, the ethics and aesthetics of hacking".

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,230
Who here recognizes the code that's in the bird?

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,050
Anyone know what it is?

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,560
The DCSS which was illegal under the digital millennium and copyright a little it's funny

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,250
you can see the codes actually in Perl, not in Python.

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,890
I was actually trying to make a joke last night about how I wanted it to be Python but

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,709
that Pythons eat birds.

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,800
And then actually I was like, well, is that true?

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,569
I Googles last night Python eat birds.

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,380
There's very graphic videos, Python do eat birds.

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,590
But that's not the reason why I didn't include it.

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:12,569
Just Perl was one of the kind of programs, this book is ethnography of Debian the free

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:13,569
software.

00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,060
I look at the governance.

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,990
Project, how humor functions among hackers I look the these big political battles over

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,240
software and code.

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,569
Now, did I something very foolish because now does this work?

00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,569
Good.

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,250
Did I something foolish which was right after finishing this book I went ahead and wrote

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,790
a second book.

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,989
Which I don't recommend.

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,940
You have no social life.

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,390
This book is called "Hacker, hoaxer, Whistleblower spy, the many faces of anonymous" my Ed editor

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,709
came up with flashy first half I was very insistent for the second half.

00:03:53,709 --> 00:04:00,080
Even though it's a faceless organization there truly are these many faces of anonymous.

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,349
It's a phenomena that's incredibly difficult to define.

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:11,099
By the many faces I mean, that it's a protest movement, that it's a symbol for popular revolt,

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,340
it is a set of activists who popularize digital direct action.

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,930
There's competing tactics in groups.

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,120
It's a meeting ground between art and politics or art and technology and one of the most

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,990
interesting elements, too, is how they symbolize anonymity but within the collective they really,

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,820
really have a strong ethic against fame seeking.

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,240
So, with so much going on it is incredibly difficult to define.

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,460
And unlike my research with comparative free software the research was quite straight forward

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,090
and simple.

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,500
The research on anonymous was incredibly thrilling and frustrating at the very same time.

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,389
The next image which was the original cover of the book but then editors like, it looks

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,350
too much like a 1980s video game.

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,600
Which he's kind of right.

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,460
The maze is the master metaphor of the book.

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,700
There is a tremendous amount of deception and secrecy in anonymous, it's very difficult

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,870
to figure things out.

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,080
You feel like you're living the reality of a puzzle.

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,229
And just recently someone on Twitter mentioned after reading my book they said, "I would

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,470
have lost my mind researching for that book".

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,530
And I replied, well, I kind of did lose my mind at a certain point.

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,760
I became incredibly paranoid.

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,820
The paranoia was kind of a low level barometric paranoia always with you.

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,090
It would only shoot up when, for example, it was viewed that one of the main hackers

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,729
Sabu was an informant working for the FBI I was like, oh, wow, that's why he sought

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,060
me out and we met all those times, right?

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,030
So, it was incredibly difficult project to study, very difficult to define.

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:06,290
And another reason why it's also so difficult to define is because it's really this idea

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:14,900
and set of Iconographies that are free to take by anyone that means that patches are

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,770
welcome by anyone.

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:24,120
And you get really a strange and odd mix of contributors, a little bit like how GitHub

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,169
makes forking very easy because you just press the button, "fork" well, forking is incredibly

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,930
common in anonymous.

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,490
There's groups that split off from existing groups, other groups that just form out of

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,520
the blue.

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,729
So it's incredibly dynamic and chaotic kind of social scene.

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:49,520
One may think that this name that is used for the purposes of political activity that's

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,710
free to take by anyone is a new phenomena there is other kind of similar groups that

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,009
have existed in our near history, in our far history.

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:06,520
For example, Luther Blissett is an icon and name that was invented by Italian activists

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,220
in 1994.

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,810
Then it started to spread across the continent in all sorts of artists, activists and hackers

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,400
took the name to lay claim to various pranks.

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,370
So that's one of the more famous ones in recent times.

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,500
But if we go back further in the 1830s, there were these riots that the farmers in England

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,620
were organizing because there was the introduction of new machines which they felt were threatening

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,780
their livelihood.

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,570
And they invented a character called Captain Swing, it was this collective name that was

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:50,090
taken by different farmers to lay claim to both actions and when they wrote letters of

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,090
protests.

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,699
So, these are couple of the sort of similar examples of collective name making that came

00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,120
in the past.

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,639
But anonymous is of the present, it's also a kind of world that's pretty geeky, filled

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:11,560
with a lot of hackers so I spent an enormous amount of time on IRC doing my research just

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,610
like I did with open source.

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,820
Many of the operations were organized, perhaps stupidly in public channels, but this is where

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,759
the activity really was.

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,810
And one of the things as an anthropologist that I did was if you're hanging around long

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,949
enough they put you to work.

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:37,740
And so I became a gopher, not the gopher protocol but a literal gopher.

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,550
Between the world of journalism and anonymous.

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,850
I taught more journalists how to get on IRC than probably anyone else in the world, a

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,990
dubious distinction to have.

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,740
But I got about 50 of them on IRC because there was reporter channel.

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,290
I translated during interviews, so this was one of my main roles.

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:03,540
At a certain point couple years into research, anonymous became a lot less anonymous.

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,790
People were arrested.

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:12,341
So, part of my research moved off line and into prisons and into kind of courts, this

00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:18,230
is Jeremy Hammond who is doing ten-year jail sentence for his activity in anonymous.

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,670
And I met quite a few nearly all of the arrested hackers.

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:30,200
Now, if you were an anonymous hacking it was probably a good idea to be on the other side

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
of the Atlantic.

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,060
This is me in London at the royal court theater with four members of low second anonymous

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,990
who had all been arrested but they are already out of jail because they don't live in the

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,350
United States.

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,480
This was a play that was about anonymous we did a panel, so it was definitely able to

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,110
meet people which definitely changed the tenor of the research.

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,690
Now, even though I said anonymous is difficult to define, I do think that there are ways

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,830
to define it.

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,370
So I'm providing a handy definition which is an activist ensemble that is multitude

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,270
news, prolific and unpredictable.

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:19,180
It's one of the reasons why it's so prolific today.

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,591
It's associated with politics and activism.

00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:29,410
This is really clear in images and posters and videos that are made.

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,910
It's about disobeying laws that are unjust.

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,339
About getting involved in different political movements, around the world.

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,570
From occupy to Ferguson.

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,570
This is just an image from last night here there is big protests in Montreal against

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,180
austerity and anonymous Quebec D-DOSed a police website and took it down.

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,630
They're all very active constantly.

00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,730
But, if today anonymous is all about activism.

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,560
Well, it's really then historical aberration and mistake.

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,970
Because in many ways anonymous was never supposed to be a political thing.

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,850
And someone in the fall who was part of an earlier generation of anonymous trolls told

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,970
me this precise thing when he or she said, you know, anonymous was never supposed to

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,970
be political.

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,430
I got a little bit scared when this person tweeted at me because I wrote a whole book

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,779
how anonymous is political.

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:34,080
I just agreed with him or her and he seemed satisfied and didn't troll me which was wonderful.

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,850
[ laughter ] But, he's referring to the fact that anonymous

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,540
was foremost a name that was used for Internet trolling.

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:49,019
Which is a form of sometimes humorous, oftentimes extremely offensive and fearsome forms of

00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,019
pranking.

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,550
Now, there's many different ways to troll, there's this idea that trolling only happens

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,820
if you're anonymous which is not true.

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,820
One of the most famous trolls in the known universe is Weev who is not anonymous.

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,540
And some ways he is the total opposite of anonymous, he trolls for his own celebrity.

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,720
But anonymous was a name that was used on the image board to organize trolling exam

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
pains.

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,490
And this is a thread that was started early on in my research when anonymous was still

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:33,050
trolling, and it was a thread that was trying to get the Army of Internet trolls to send

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,160
me hundreds of Pizzas, Dox my Social Security number my heart sunk when I saw.

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:48,519
This and somewhat thankfully the campaign never took off but obviously many, many campaigns

00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,910
that were organized ed on this anonymous image board did take off.

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,670
I suspect here people know what trolling is.

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,350
But I just want to offer one final definition that I kind of like by Whitney Phillips who

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,820
is just wrote a great book about trolls.

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,300
Trolls enjoy desecrating anything remotely take credit as cultural theorist Whitney Phillips

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,000
conveys in her 'suit characterization of trolls as agents of cultural digestion, who scavenge

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,170
the landscape, repurpose the most offensive material then shove the resulting monstrosities

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,320
into the faces of unsuspecting.

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,510
They do it for the Lulz their own enjoyment.

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:39,430
Anonymous was so famous for trolling that in 2007 they were called the Internet hate

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,089
machine by fox news.

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,240
Anonymous thought this street pretty great name they took on that moniker.

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,970
Now, six months after being called the Internet hate machine, there was a transformation,

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,830
a U-turn and anonymous got engaged in activists campaigns.

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,850
Now, how did this happen.

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,230
Well, I'm going to show you a short video clip that is completely -- really two video

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,079
clips that are completely responsible for the transformation.

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,990
Let me just show you 30 seconds of the first one.

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,470
>> If that's what Mr. Cruise has brought to this world, there still remains one more word

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,730
on the man.

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:30,980
Call it Tom cruise on Tom cruise Scientologist.

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,820
>> Being Scientologist when you drive past an accident it's not like anyone else.

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,829
As you drive past you know you have to do something about it because you know you're

00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,709
the only one that can really help.

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:53,790
But that's what drives me is that I know we have an opportunity and to really help.

00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:00,200
[ laughter ] >> This video was leaked by little "A" anonymous

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,600
it was Scientologist, critics of the church who got this to journalists, spread like wildfire.

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Who here has watched it before?

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,750
So, not enough.

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,000
Watch the rest of the thing it was hilarious.

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,519
You know the Internet was enjoying what was Luhlz even though it wasn't trying to be.

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,160
The church of Scientology went after news publishers like gawker said, we're going to

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,300
sue you if you don't take that down.

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,570
And anonymous is like, we're enjoying this video.

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,370
You're going to sue publishers?

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,370
You know what?

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,329
We're going to engage in the most epic trolling campaign we have ever engaged in.

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:39,709
That's precisely what they did.

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:46,180
So this is a quote from my book by someone who participated in this trolling campaign

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,149
led by anonymous against the church of Scientology.

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,350
>>> The unified bulk of anonymous collaborated through massive chat rooms to engage in various

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,220
forms of ultra coordinated motherfuckery.

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:06,970
For very short time websites were hacked Ddos'ed to remove from them the Internet.

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,840
The dianetics telephone hot lines were completely bombarded with prank calls.

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,649
All-black pieces of paper were fixed to -- faxed to every fax number we could get hands on.

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:19,680
And the secrets of their religion were blasted all over the Internet I also personally scanned

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,329
by bare Ass and faxed it to them.

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:32,449
Because Fuck them.

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:40,839
A handful of people went on IRC channel creating a Luhlzy video for the fun of it I'm going

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,319
to show you a short clip of it.

00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,850
[ video clip ] >> Anonymous has their decided that organization

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,940
should be destroyed.

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,050
For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind and for our own enjoyment.

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,480
We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the church of

00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,740
Scientology and its present form.

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,810
We recognize you as serious opponents.

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,779
And do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short timeframe.

00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:12,609
However, you will not layup against the angry masses of the body politic your choice of

00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,069
methods, you're hypocrisy and lawlessness of your organization have --

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,720
>> I love that you're general artlessness.

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,089
I'll show you an example.

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,619
This video was very interesting because even though it was done as a joke it helped spark

00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,619
a debate.

00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,990
A lot of people said, maybe we should kind of earnestly dismantle the church of Scientology.

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,799
And then ex-critics of the church reached out to anonymous said, look, your campaign

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:45,470
was really amazing, can you join us and just let go of the trolling but become part of

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,909
this sort of protest against the church of Scientology.

00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:53,559
Well, enough people in anonymous decided to go ahead with the experiment of protesting

00:17:53,559 --> 00:18:01,559
the church of Scientology and on February 10th, 2008 in over 127 cities around the world,

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:10,119
over 9,000 geeks and hackers showed up in front of Scientology churches to protest them.

00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:16,440
The largest protests were in Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles.

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,850
And they were of wild success.

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:26,619
Now most people came out to meet other people from four tran, it is anonymous image board

00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:31,859
you spent all your time on four tran, so great to meet you a lot of piece people receded

00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,210
back to the caverns of the Internet.

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:41,269
But enough people stayed on to protest the church of Scientology every month that a new

00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:44,840
project, activist project, got constituted.

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,100
Now, you could imagine a lot of the trolls were really F-ing pissed off at.

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,649
This you are using the name of anonymous for activism.

00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:02,740
We are a fearsome band of trollings and in fact, soon after this activist campaign, the

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,830
most notorious trolling campaign ever under the name of anonymous occurred.

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,179
And it was people seeking revenge.

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:17,350
This was when a number of people, I don't know how many went to epilepsy forums and

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,590
posted flashing Gifs.

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,320
This could endanger people's lives.

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,980
I mention this because it was a real serious transformation to have trolls become activists

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,609
and some were extremely upset.

00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:34,940
What was amazing I was watching at this point, wow, the name will never survive.

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
But it did.

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
It did.

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,470
The name anonymous was used to protest the church of Scientology.

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:48,190
Now I had explanation I not this was truly historical aberration the only reason why

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:54,279
there was an allowance for activity was the church of Scientology is the perfect Nemesis

00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,979
for geeks and hackers.

00:19:55,979 --> 00:20:02,950
You can't have an organization that stands in such a kind of anti-Potal opposite inverted

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,840
relation slip to the geek and hacker world.

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,600
To give you a taste of this, I think you all know why this is so, right, Scientology is

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,599
a religion of fake technology and pseudoscience.

00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,639
But let me show you a document from the church of Scientology which is called "Keep Scientology

00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:25,159
working" it's their philosophy of technology.

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,029
So one is having the correct technology.

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,610
Two, knowing the technology.

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,729
Three, knowing it is correct.

00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,460
Four, teaching correct the correct technology.

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,879
Five applying the technology.

00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:38,350
Seeing that the sec technology is correctly applied.

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,580
Hammering out the existence of incorrect technology.

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,700
Knocking out incorrect applications.

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,379
Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.

00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,899
And so on, so forth.

00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:48,899
Right?

00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,409
This is not how geeks and hackers treat technology where you're supposed to bend it to your own

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:53,409
kind of will.

00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:58,369
And so I think there's a real pleasure in protesting your perfect nemesis.

00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:04,549
I kind of chalked it up to that, under the right historical circumstances anonymous became

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:11,750
activists, but it won't ever, ever exceed a politics of protesting the church of Scientology.

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,799
But between 2008 and 2010 certain things happened.

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,809
The name was still used by trolls.

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,269
There was campaign still ongoing against the church of Scientology.

00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:29,429
But really the big player in town was Wikileaks.

00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:36,299
This is from April 2010 when Wikileaks collateral murder the murder of American soldiers gunning

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:43,840
down Reuters journalists in comparison to Wikileaks anonymous seemed extremely geopolitically

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,529
insignificant.

00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:49,369
But then something happened soon after in September of 2010.

00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:59,059
A new node by the name of Anonops which became own dedicated IRC server came into being to

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:05,489
protest to defend filing sharing and piracy.

00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:13,999
The unique in know separation about this node was Chanology dropped it but not for trolling

00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,759
but for political protests.

00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:23,440
Soon after they would come to intersect with Wikileaks, that would happen after Wikileaks

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,259
jumped the diplomatic cables which upset the U.S. government quite dramatically.

00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:37,460
And as people here probably remember the U.S. government asked services that were providing

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,929
support for Wikileaks like PayPal, MasterCard to pull the plug.

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,909
They precisely did that and this angered the Internet, right?

00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:55,879
Anonymous was in very good position to then engage in a big Ddos attack against PayPal,

00:22:55,879 --> 00:23:03,409
MasterCard and Visa, it was the largest Ddos protests action the Internet has ever seen.

00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:08,019
There was 7,000 people logged on to one IRC channel that's a lot of people.

00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,019
For one channel.

00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:15,269
Lots of people were using anonymous was using the bot nets as well.

00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:22,210
Now, soon after this, anonymous gets involved in Tunisia and the Arab spring and this is

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,279
the moment really when anonymous becomes anonymous everywhere.

00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:34,860
They got involved in operations in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, the Arab spring, it really started

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,659
to look like this.

00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,240
It was a kind of hydra, with many different competing groups and tax particulars who were

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,840
getting involved across the world.

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,159
Now, one of the things about anonymous is that a certain operation will change the course

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:53,239
of its future.

00:23:53,239 --> 00:24:00,299
And there was one operation HG Gary that occurred in February of 2011 that brought out the hacking

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,559
in a very public way.

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,549
So there was a person called Aaron barr who was security researcher that worked for HB

00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:15,789
Gary and he basically had said that he had infiltrated anonymous and that he was going

00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:20,629
to give over the names to the FBI and this was published in the "Financial times" anonymous

00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:25,190
was quite upset he is specially because most of the names were actually wrong.

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:31,609
So article was published in the morning, in the afternoon HB Gary was brutally hacked

00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:38,929
they downloaded 70,000 e-mails, they deleted a bunch of files, they took over Aaron barr's

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:40,690
Twitter account.

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,849
This was this momentous act of revenge.

00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:49,159
But during the course of the operation and sifting through the e-mails, they found some

00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,159
politically damning information, there was a PowerPoint presentation called the Wikileaks

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,250
threats which HB Gary was proposing for bank of America.

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:08,009
And the idea was to discredit Wikileaks by planting false information by Ddosing it and

00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:14,600
discrediting and smearing journalists like Glenn greenwald who supported Wikileaks.

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,440
The effect on anonymous was twofold.

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,809
First of all a lot of the hackers grew into hacking companies just to expose security

00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,309
vulnerabilities.

00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:30,649
And Lulzsec did just this for 50 days.

00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:35,149
They hacked for 50 days.

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:43,399
Retired antisec came into being looking for politically damning information through their

00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:44,899
hacks.

00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:53,590
So, between 2012-14 trolling under the name for the most part stops, increasingly you

00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,399
have a lot of global operations, the name is used for very different types of operations.

00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:02,760
But you also have a lot of arrests as well.

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,059
In 2012.

00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:11,599
In part because the fellow with the FBI badge was Sabu who was to become informant he helped

00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,190
catch a lot of people.

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,229
But this didn't stop anonymous.

00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:17,389
It changed things.

00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:24,450
So in the United States, in Canada a lot of the operations became focused on publicizing

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:31,289
other kind of issues, most famously they got involved in a number of rape cases in Stubenenville,

00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,450
Ohio, in Halifax.

00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,269
A lot of the hacking then moved off shore to Latin America.

00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:46,590
For example, this is Lulzsec Peru hacked in to the government found e-mails showing corruption.

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:52,039
And the Peruvian government was one vote shy away from collapsing.

00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,070
There was just an article the other day, couple days ago about anonymous international which

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,249
is a kind of group that attacks the Kremlin, a Russian group.

00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:10,219
So, a lot of the hacking is occurring but in very different types -- very -- not in

00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:14,950
the United States where you're going to get thrown in jail for ten years.

00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,539
So, for my last ten minutes I want to transition a little bit, I wanted to give you a little

00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:25,669
bit of a picture of anonymous and you ho they came into being how odd it was that they became

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:27,639
an activists force.

00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:32,460
But I think one of the interesting things about anonymous is that they're not the only

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,950
player in town.

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,830
A lot of geeks and hackers are taking the political sword in greater numbers than ever

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,039
before and in very different ways as well.

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,649
Anonymous is only one kind of element in this diverse ecology.

00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:56,190
Anonymous is the grass roots participatory direct action wing of a much broader set of

00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,590
trends.

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:03,720
And Wikileaks in many ways epitomize this dramatic kind of transformation of geeks and

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,979
hackers willing to take dramatic risks for the purposes of trying to save democracy,

00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,919
expose surveillance.

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,570
But again very diverse landscape with so many different types of actors.

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,700
And geeks are building tools, writing free software, running technology, collective like

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:33,440
riseup, founding political parties and of course, whistle blowing and leaking as well.

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,830
One of the things that I find interesting is that there's a lot of differences between,

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,919
let's say the political party and anonymous.

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:50,549
In fact the political party, the pirate party begged anonymous to stop Ddosing anonymous

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,210
is like, that's what we do.

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,809
We believe that this is a form of civil disobedience.

00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,789
So even though we have shared interests our tactics are different.

00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:06,909
I think it's good to have a kind of diverse tactical landscape, but it's also important

00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:10,909
to have moments of unity and synergy, right?

00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:13,429
And we've seen many of these in the last couple of years.

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:20,999
I think most dramatically we saw that with stopping Sopa, the stop online piracy act.

00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:25,989
Where so many different quarters of the geek world from the corporate to grass roots to

00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:33,840
free software every kind of imaginable institution kind of contributed with dramatic effect.

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,759
And now I'm going to show you a clip of Edward Snowden who needs no introduction who I think

00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,460
speaks to importance of free software.

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,580
In the fight.

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,099
So, let me just play that clip for a second.

00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:57,219
>> It's a really complex topic and I think -- when we talk about whether or not the government

00:29:57,219 --> 00:30:02,929
begins going after journalists, this is the real sticking point for me, because in terms

00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:11,700
of my political philosophy as it relates to technology here, is I would say almost Stalin-esque.

00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,740
When you think about free software.

00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,749
When you think about free software we need to think about software as a means of expressing

00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:22,749
our freedom.

00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:26,219
But also defending our freedom.

00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:29,419
Governments rely on the same technologies we do.

00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:32,849
They adopt the same standards, they use the same products.

00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,570
And this happens worldwide.

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:43,979
So, the solution to that when you ask me, is whether or not the United States government

00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:49,429
can manage to behave itself, to restrain itself against violating the constitution, against

00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:54,509
bringing sights against journalists against limiting the freedom of press other governments

00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:55,740
will make different decisions.

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,570
And if we want to live in a better more enlightened world what we'd need to do is to remove those

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:08,100
capabilities from the governments by enshrining our rights into our means of --

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
>> Okay.

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:15,960
It's funny because when I saw this I hadn't known whether Snowden was into open source

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,759
or free software this was nice confirmation of the importance of free software in the

00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,059
general fight.

00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:30,580
Now, as you can imagine if geeks and hackers are in greater numbers engaging in leaking

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,769
and whistle blowing and activism, well, the government is also then really going after

00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:43,549
geeks and hackers and there have been a tremendous number of people who have been arrested in

00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:47,959
anonymous there have been over 100 arrests around the world with very, very long jail

00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:50,259
sentences in the United States.

00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:57,330
Julian Assange has been under house arrest, Snowden is in exile, others are in exile.

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:04,929
And government is pretty unhappy with these kind of trends and in fact the next image

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:13,889
is a slide from GSHQ which is about Tore they have a list of Tor that is the good news,

00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:19,769
the bad news, the bad uses includes pedophiles and anonymous, right?

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:23,369
So the government is not exactly thrilled.

00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:26,450
That you have all these hackers taking political action.

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:32,419
But probably the most disturbing trend is not simply that the hackers are getting in

00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:35,509
trouble, some of them after all, are breaking into servers, right?

00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:39,229
I mean, what they're doing is criminal.

00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:41,659
Even if one might say it's politically acceptable.

00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:47,760
But I think the most disturbing trend is that they're going after journalists as well, which

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,469
is what Edward Snowden had mention.

00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:56,129
Here we have an image of Barrett brown who was a core anonymous activist, he was never

00:32:56,129 --> 00:32:59,340
anonymous, he always used his name.

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:07,049
And he never hacked but he was thrown in jail and faced 100-year sentence, simply for sharing

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:13,959
a link to stolen data as part of a hack against a global intelligence firm, Stratford.

00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:25,149
Now, eventually those charges were dropped and he was in the end only charged for three

00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:30,669
things, he was charged for threatening an FBI agent, which did he on a video.

00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:34,330
He hid his laptops during a warrant search.

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,909
Then he was also charged for what is called accessory after the fact.

00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:44,999
He went to the hackers and said, hey, I want to get the e-mails you got through your hack

00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:52,279
to put them on my journalistic website, project PM, for saying that, he became an accessory

00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,499
after the fact.

00:33:54,499 --> 00:34:04,330
And basically he ended up, the judge said, "More than merely reported the hackers' activities"

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,570
he helped organize them".

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:14,800
And in the end he got 64 months in jail and had to pay -- will have to pay nearly $1 million

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,480
restitution fine which is unbelievable for a journalist.

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,359
One may think that Barrett brown is an outlier.

00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:28,049
He was charged and sentenced in Texas as his lawyer said, it's always a crap shoot when

00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:29,869
you're in Texas.

00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:36,799
But right around this time there was a really amazing article that came out in the "Guardian"

00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:45,500
that showed that the GCHQ had Hoovered 70,000 e-mails in one day in ten minutes.

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:54,190
A lot of those e-mails were of journalists from places like the "New York Times", BBC

00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,190
and Reuters.

00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:05,890
And what is really remarkable is that journalists were represented as a threat to security.

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:12,539
They were actually a little less threatening than terrorists, but more threatening than

00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:13,539
hackers.

00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,569
Which I was like, wow, how did that happen?

00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,660
That's incredible.

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,270
And now really just to wrap up because I think it is quite disturbing that journalists are

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:30,299
being tagged as a national security threat when they are the ones who are necessary to

00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:33,539
keep government power in check.

00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,609
It's disturbing.

00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:43,270
I felt like I had to put these two images of XENU and GCHQ which looks like alien space

00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,690
ship.

00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:52,740
We find Scientology so weird and unbelievable because, again, science fiction is the basis

00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,600
for their scientific methods, it doesn't work.

00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:06,920
GQHQ heralding journalists as terrorist threat is even weirder and more terrifying in my

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,049
opinion.

00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:15,579
Scientology is more attackable in some ways because it's more confined.

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:21,270
But what is going on with GCHQ is absolutely frightening.

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:30,200
And just to finish a couple, let's just say about -- basically until June, 2013, I portrayed

00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,280
anonymous as the funeral at the funeral of online privacy.

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,049
I was like, it's over.

00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:42,740
There are just too many vectors and too many threats.

00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,760
But after the leaks, which also spurred the development of technological tools for encryption

00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,970
I feel like the reaper has been kept at bay a little bit.

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,950
And what is so exciting about seeing so many people in this room is that free software

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,010
does play an important role in that fight.

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,010
So just to finish I just want to say, keep on doing what you're doing.

00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:12,460
And thank you so much for listening to my talk.

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:19,710
Thank you.

00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:25,160
[ Applause ] I can't take questions.

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,970
But I'm going to be around all day so you can find me and ask me as many questions as

00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,970
you want.

00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:30,971
