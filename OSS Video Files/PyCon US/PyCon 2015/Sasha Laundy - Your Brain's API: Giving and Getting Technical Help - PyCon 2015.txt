Title: Sasha Laundy - Your Brain's API: Giving and Getting Technical Help - PyCon 2015
Publication date: 2015-04-12
Playlist: PyCon 2015
Description: 
	"Speaker: Sasha Laundy

Software engineers are never done learning since our field is always changing. We are always beginners at some things and experts at others. Along the way from beginner to expert we have to ask a lot of questions, but it can be hard to get help. This talk gives concrete tools to help you ask with confidence, and highlights common expert mistakes that inadvertently make people feel foolish.

good afternoon everyone we're gonna get

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,210
started with the last session of the day

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,160
and it kicks off with Sasha Lundy

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:20,640
telling us about our brains API

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:23,340
let's welcome hi thanks for coming so

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,250
the title of my talk is your brains API

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,689
giving and getting technical help

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,300
another title I could have picked for it

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,309
was getting technical help without being

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,649
scared and giving technical help without

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,050
being a jerk accidentally but that was a

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,809
little long that fit into the form I

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,000
guess I could have abbreviated it but I

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,610
thought this would be even less clear so

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,399
it's called your brains API giving and

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,140
getting technical help I first

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,079
discovered that asking can be really

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,210
hard when I was 20 in my physics seminar

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,010
I majored in physics and we had this

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,960
class once a week or we got together for

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,370
three hours and talked about what we

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,649
learned that week what we'd read about

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,090
what problems we'd worked on and I had

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,760
this distinct memory of sitting in this

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,930
class and the professor was talking

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,189
about some section of the book that I

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,020
just like hadn't read I couldn't figure

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,060
out where we were and I sort of asked

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,189
the guy to my left I was like hey what

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,900
chapters is so he's like no no but he

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,979
looked like he knew it was going on the

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,960
guy to my right looked like you knew

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,450
what was going on too so I was like hey

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,509
where are we he was like oh no so I was

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,340
like hi Oh what section hurry on and I

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,780
had to ask the question but that was

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,909
really hard that dynamic in that

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,320
particular Department because I always

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,729
had to be the one who is asking the

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,990
question even though no one else knew

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,869
what was going on either and that was

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,400
really tough for me emotionally I also

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,869
learned that helping can be really hard

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,220
because I went on to teach physics and

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,890
neuroscience for five years after that

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,710
and it's the hardest job I'll probably

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:52,710
ever have I taught ninth grade physics

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,210
first and the kids come in with a really

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,619
well-formed sense of who they are

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,030
already what kind of student they are

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,500
whether they're a math person or a

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,270
science person and what they like and

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
part of my job was to take those people

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,969
who didn't think they were math and

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,520
science people and make them love

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,489
science and that was very challenging I

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,800
also learned how huge this can be what a

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,599
big impact so when I transitioned into

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,170
the tech industry my first job was at

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,870
Twilio

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,990
and we had an angry customer right in

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,970
once he sent this very angry email in

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,080
and I was thinking about it and kind of

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,220
took it personally at first I was like

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,410
why is he so angry at us we were like

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,250
trying to provide this great API for him

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,209
and I asked him a few questions and

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,800
provided him some help that he needed

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,290
and he turned into someone who actually

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,330
sent three positive tweets about us by

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,160
the end of it and I realized that the

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,959
way you give help can really have a big

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,850
impact on someone and someone who's

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,040
writing to you angry actually cares and

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,720
you could turn them around with a few

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,530
questions so helping in the right way

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,540
can really make a big difference I also

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,910
want to argue that how you help is

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,100
culture it's the culture of your

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,750
community like the Python community it's

00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,820
the culture of your company or your

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,140
school your group and the way that you

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,970
help people and give help in the way

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,780
that you ask for help is an integral

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,690
part of your culture

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,790
I also learned this as a teacher when I

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,340
taught the second half of an advanced

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,570
physics class the first half was taught

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,370
by a different teacher but the same

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,560
group of kids who's about half boys half

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,900
girls I taught them electricity and

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,459
magnetism and the kids came in with this

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,630
very interesting dynamic that's fairly

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,730
common

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,530
the boys would blurt out and answer

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,730
questions that I asked in class and the

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,290
girls would raise their hand and then

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,480
get shouted over and then not say the

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,700
thing they were gonna say and when it

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,590
was lab time I would say hey the

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,930
materials over here here's the lab

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,090
handout here's what you need to do go

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,530
for it the boys would run over grab the

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,090
equipment and the girls would sit and

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,190
wait for them to come back and so this

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,620
kind of got to me for kind of obvious

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,090
reasons and I did some reading about it

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,390
I did some thinking about it and I made

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,290
some really subtle tweaks to how I

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,000
interacted with them in the in the

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,070
classroom for example one of those

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,370
tweaks was I read some research that

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,320
showed that teachers are rushed to help

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,540
girls more quickly than they help boys

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,920
they let the boys struggle a little bit

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,840
more with the work they're doing and

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,519
implicitly send a signal that the boys

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,130
are more capable and will figure it out

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,840
and so I looked at that research and a

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,160
few other bits of research and tweaks

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,320
and things and the kids never even knew

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,630
about this but after about six weeks of

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,900
this I had everyone was raising their

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,250
hand and waiting to speak and I had

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,169
girls and boys going to get the

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,720
equipment in a much more manageable way

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,640
and so

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,290
it really turned the culture and feel of

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,080
the class around and so this is where I

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,280
learned learned how big helping can

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,250
really make a difference in how the

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,140
whole organization the whole group feels

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,460
and actually as I was transitioning into

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,020
the tech industry from teaching I

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,540
actually had such a rough time with this

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,520
at i/o s meet ups at Python meetups in

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,280
San Francisco that I actually started a

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,690
place an organization that would do a

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,070
better job of this because it meant so

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,450
much to me and I wanted that space in my

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,430
life so much

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,620
I also jumped ship when I got a

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,260
opportunity to work at code Academy in

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,080
the early days because I really thought

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,140
that code Kadim e has this potential to

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,220
change the face of who is programming

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,780
and make it much more friendly and

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,030
accessible cuz we had so many millions

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,280
of users who love the friendly tone and

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,110
voice of code Academy and so I took the

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,180
site from one lesson with a few steps in

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,890
it to six tracks with all the different

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,169
languages fully fleshed out and that was

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,680
really rewarding to see like what sorts

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,640
of people loved engaging with

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,390
programming when it was given a friendly

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,150
face it was also a really great

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,730
experience to land at the recurse Center

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,280
formerly known as hacker school this is

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,050
a 12 week retreat for programmers in New

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,950
York City it's a great experience we've

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,520
got some hacker schoolers in the

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,860
audience here today and the culture

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,080
there is fantastic they maniacally focus

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,310
on it the facilitators there are very

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,840
thoughtful about how they put it

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,120
together and have done an amazing job of

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,010
creating a great culture of learning and

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,610
getting giving and getting technical

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,470
help one symptom of this good culture is

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,240
that instead of getting an error in your

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,470
code and going down my code doesn't work

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,990
and shaking your fists instead you start

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,669
hearing things like this oh I got an

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,410
error in my code how interesting I

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,810
didn't expect that I have something to

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,010
learn and this is a really good symptom

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,169
of a good culture and I'll talk a little

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,000
bit more about that later they also have

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,919
some social rules that serve as like

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,300
social guide rails so you don't

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,530
accidentally hurt yourself and we'll

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,320
talk about those a little bit later as

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,240
well I currently work at a place called

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,740
poly numeral in New York City we're

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,310
helping this we're starting a data

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,680
science consultancy and we really focus

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,270
on culture as one of our things we

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,260
really focus on in terms of learning and

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,250
getting better and we're trying to

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,950
create a good place for the

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,300
because culture really is a competitive

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,490
advantage and if you can do this really

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,870
well you can hire amazing people you can

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,780
take junior folks and grow them into

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,920
amazing amazing senior folks and so

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,090
culture really is a competitive

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,850
advantage and I think all the stuff I'm

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,350
going to talk about asking helping all

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,710
these sorts of things really play into

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:03,070
this today so before I get started on

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,290
that why are you here you had a several

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,490
options and lots of places in Montreal

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,920
you could be right now like why did you

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,300
choose this particular talk to come to I

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,080
just want to make sure you think about

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,820
that because there are a lot of

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,770
different answers to this you could for

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,650
example want to speed up your own growth

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,940
your own learning you could want you

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,080
could be struggling with how to get

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,390
unstuck when you're stuck on a tough

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,830
problem you could be working on getting

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,000
better at mentoring or maybe you're

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,370
having trouble with a particular person

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,600
at your work or in your community so

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,950
take a second why are you in this

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:37,000
particular talk what do you want to take

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:39,280
away from it so today we're gonna talk

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,350
about asking and helping and I'm gonna

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,850
give you some specific tools for making

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:48,070
those two things easier because they can

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:51,220
be really challenging but first let's

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,169
talk about the little voice so many of

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,370
you might identify with this of having a

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,200
little voice in your head that says

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,479
things like I'm never gonna get good at

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,580
this or this is so hard and I keep

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,120
getting stuck maybe I'm not cut out for

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,729
this how many of you identify with this

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,550
little voice in some way great I'm

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,080
seeing lots of hands I do two really

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,360
effective leaders and mentors and

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,090
teachers know about the little voice and

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
they work with it instead of against it

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,229
so this is this is a boy named Vidale

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,390
from New York City and Vidale was

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:24,000
photographed by this photographer who

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,350
runs a blog called humans of New York

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,640
and humans of New York is this guy who

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,990
goes around New York and takes pictures

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,970
of interesting people and then - or

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,830
sometimes not interesting looking people

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,500
just boring looking people but he has

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,789
this amazing ability to pull out very

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,280
interesting little snippets of their

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,700
life and their backstory and he talked

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,740
to this boy of it all and asked him who

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,950
influenced you the most in your life and

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,810
he said my principal miss Lopez how has

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,000
she influenced you when we get in

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,720
trouble she doesn't suspend us she calls

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,790
us to her

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,950
and explains to us how society was built

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,410
down around us and one time she made

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,310
every student stand up one at a time and

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,440
she told us that each one of us matters

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,450
so Miss Lopez is clearly a very talented

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,390
administrator and educator and made a

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,340
big impact on this boy and if you if

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,470
this sounds familiar to you it's because

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,880
this story went viral and they raised a

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,530
million dollars for their school and

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,150
it's a pretty amazing story and it got

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,350
to highlight the work that the educators

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,710
and administrators at the school are

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,210
doing so miss Lopez knows this and works

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,210
with this and it's important to know

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,870
this about the people that are around

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,940
you as well all the folks who were

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,260
thinking like when I get up on stage at

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,310
PyCon what are they all going to think

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:42,160
of me and it's important to acknowledge

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,660
that everyone has this little voice but

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
it's different for some people life

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,290
experience and cultural forces shape the

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,660
sorts of things are little boys might

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,190
say to us and the specific worries that

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,480
we might have and that may not be

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,390
visible to when you're looking at

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,160
someone else xkcd did a great comic on

00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,160
this and I'll let him speak for me here

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,550
this is referencing tokenism which is an

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,590
area of research that's been done since

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,450
the 70s hasn't you made it into the tech

00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,850
industry knowing about this but if

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,360
you're one of a very small number in a

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,950
community or in an event what you do you

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,270
take on that burden of not just being

00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,250
judged yourself with being judged as a

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,260
part of the group you're from and this

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,880
goes away when to take up more of the

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,220
space in the room and more people around

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,020
you who look like you so you never know

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,130
what sorts of little voices people have

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,450
going through their head and you really

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,890
need to know that before you can talk to

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,800
them effectively so remember the little

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,010
voice askers fight the little voice

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,210
don't let it win and helpers you need to

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,380
know that this is what's happening in

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,960
their heads and they may not ever tell

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,490
you about it this is really important

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,990
because if they're afraid to ask for

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,970
help it stops them from stretching and

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,890
if you don't stretch you don't grow and

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,170
your team stagnates your company you

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,990
can't build amazing things so pay

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,820
attention to a little voice so without

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,560
further ado let's talk about asking and

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,600
first let's talk a little bit about the

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,100
mindset of asking and then about some

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,950
specific tools that you can use to make

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,480
it more useful so first of all remember

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,030
that even though if you're talking to a

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,580
super senior person

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,350
you know some stuff and they know some

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,360
stuff and you know some of the same

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,890
stuff but it doesn't mean they have like

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,900
infinitely more knowledge than you about

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,280
everything you just have overlapping

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,230
knowledge you may know a lot of stuff

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,400
about stuff they don't know about so

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,440
remember this when you go and talk to

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,730
them also if you're confused if your

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,190
code has just done something you didn't

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,570
expect that's a sign you're about to

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,220
learn something new the your mental

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,980
model was not correct and you're about

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,550
to learn the correct one and last of all

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:42,030
be brave it's scary sometimes do it

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,440
anyway you just gotta push through here

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,220
are some tools that you can use for

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,770
asking so first find a good place to

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,020
work this sounds kind of flippant and I

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,730
totally acknowledge all the privilege

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,020
that we have in this community of having

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,180
a lot of options about the types of

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,440
places that we work but I just want to

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,420
put this one up here and it's sort of

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,730
like a base level importance one because

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,530
if you were in a toxic culture no matter

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,210
how good you get it asking and no matter

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,520
how brave you are you're gonna have a

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,900
bad time and one thing that's very

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,120
important is the people at the top

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,500
really set the the leaders the founders

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,520
they really set the culture so pay

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,690
attention to the leaders and the

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,730
founders next time you're interviewing

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,290
you can ask lots of questions that get

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,720
at this so you know you're ending up in

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:27,690
a good place this is this is really

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,610
really key second thing is to ask early

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,930
this is one I really struggled with when

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,320
I was in the first few months of my job

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,240
I would wait I was like I can figure

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,740
this out I know I can and I would like

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,110
look it you know Google Stack Overflow

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,820
doc so try different things and I would

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,910
like wait about an hour to ask for help

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,070
and my boss finally talked to me and was

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,570
like you need to ask earlier I don't

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,280
mind just interrupting me but you have

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,170
to ask earlier or we can't move as fast

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,580
and I hadn't really seen it in the whole

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,260
team frame that way so that was a really

00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,850
important moment and I started it's

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,510
really hard but I've started asking for

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,860
help earlier on the third thing you can

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,120
do is demonstrate competence because

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,260
experts actually really like helping

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,670
people who will take the ball and run

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,460
with it and build something amazing on

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,490
their advice and people who follow up so

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,990
be confident and demonstrate competence

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,390
one way you can do this is by auditing

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,620
your speech patterns instead of saying

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,060
well I mean

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,830
I don't really know I haven't done dude

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,470
but what do you think you can just say

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,750
what do you think and sort of top that

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,580
off this one's also really challenging

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,200
to this day I still go through emails to

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,750
my team when I'm suggesting a new course

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,089
of action and I delete all the I thinks

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,290
I just say what I think and delete do

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,910
things but I still have to go through

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,350
and edit that out this ones are really a

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:45,900
really tough one you can also tell them

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,460
what you need so say what kind of help

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,140
you wants and you don't want at that

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,490
particular moment and this can take a

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,260
lot of forms but I'm going to show you a

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,060
magic trick that has really changed

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,330
things for me I use this one all the

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,910
time

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,660
my whole team uses it now too and that's

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,940
this magic of 30 percent feedback it's

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,400
basically asking for telling the person

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,040
how much done the thing is that you're

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,980
asking for feedback on so they can frame

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,960
that accordingly if it's 90 percent done

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,630
they're just gonna fix some typos change

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,130
some wording and throw it out the door

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,900
but if it's ten or thirty percent done

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,279
then they can say to you hey you're

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,660
taking the totally wrong approach on

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,520
this or there's this huge thing you've

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,020
missed or whatever and you can end up

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,200
with a much better final product so

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,760
literally be use this I say like hey I'm

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
working on this thing it's thirty

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,550
percent done could you take a look and

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,470
tell me what you think and they're like

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,670
okay and then I get feedback back that's

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,440
the kind of expecting because this

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,630
mismatch can be really challenging to

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,010
navigate this is seriously magic if you

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,920
remember nothing else from this talk

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,690
please use this one oh the other thing

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,820
this frees you up for is for all the

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,890
perfectionist in the room this frees you

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,860
up to show stuff that's not done that's

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,540
messy that's incomplete that's a sketch

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,490
and one question I got I gave this talk

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,160
of a week or so ago one question I got

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,080
that I thought was really excellent is

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,040
that there in a place that is that they

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,690
were having trouble with this one

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,700
essentially and the advice that they

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,110
liked was that the form factor of the

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,150
thing you're asking for feedback on

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,130
tells information about how done it is

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,620
so if you're sketching up a product for

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,230
example instead of doing like Photoshop

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,060
to pixel perfect sketches actually just

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,860
do something on a whiteboard or a napkin

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,170
and show it to them the form factor of

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,750
the thing you're showing someone tells

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,120
them what kind of feedback you want so

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,650
when I'm sending emails to a client's or

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,870
to someone you know an important email

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,209
and I'm just drafting it I'll leave in

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,399
all the typos I leave every

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,199
in lowercase just so it's clear that I'm

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,309
not about to hit Send and people will

00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,990
give me different kinds of feedback on

00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:44,149
it one thing you can do as well is to

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,699
say what you've already done so you can

00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:48,199
say I already tried using this data

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,639
structure instead of this one I tried

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,720
looking it up on Stack Overflow and I

00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,490
read the docs but I didn't really

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,319
understand this particular section you

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,959
can give a history of what you've

00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,730
already done there's a lot of examples

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,499
of doing this poorly on Stack Overflow

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,759
people are like I have a type error help

00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:06,649
. like that's it that's the whole thing

00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,759
right and that's impossible to help that

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,889
person because you've no idea what

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,019
they're working on so give some sense of

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,309
what you've already done and that can

00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:18,259
really help you get a better answer out

00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:20,720
of people here's a little script that

00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:23,300
you can use as well this says my current

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,389
understanding is blue I expect to see

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,869
blue but instead it's doing blue what

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,699
should I do

00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:30,949
so this shows what you're expecting to

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:34,009
happen and then we saw and it gives you

00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:35,300
a way of asking about the difference so

00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,769
that the person helping you isn't trying

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,059
to guess what you're thinking or it

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,379
tells you something you already know or

00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:42,410
whatever they can zero in on the part

00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:44,149
you need help on you can also say I want

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,129
to do blue and I'm trying it by doing

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,619
blue what do you think about this

00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,879
approach this is particularly useful at

00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:51,619
the beginning of a product so we're not

00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,269
sure which tool you should pick up or

00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,949
which you know machine learning

00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,829
algorithm you should use or whatever

00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:59,480
this is really good in the early stages

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:02,179
and then at the end once you've gotten

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,130
help make sure to say it back to them to

00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:05,600
check your understanding this is

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,179
particularly useful for people who are

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,230
very long-winded or maybe rambling in

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,539
their answers because they're not

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,549
trained and how to do this and if you're

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:15,409
saying okay I just heard all that stuff

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,640
my question was this and what I'm

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,860
hearing is I should do this this and

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,220
this most of the time they'll be like

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,929
yes 25% of the time they may be like no

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,120
that is not what I said at all that is

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:27,439
the wrong direction and this catches

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,000
that really early so you don't go

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,380
charging off in the wrong direction and

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,880
then getting help later is even harder

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,840
so to sum up asking here are five tools

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,460
you can use picking a good team

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,980
15-minute rule ask early say what you

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,220
need say we've done and say it back to

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,220
them

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,650
so now let's talk about helping and

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,060
before we talk about helping I want to

00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,280
acknowledge that this is really hard

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,230
this is a really hard thing to do

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,760
we've never taught how to do this we're

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,500
never taught how to give critical

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,300
feedback effectively we're never really

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,680
taught how to be leaders we're never

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,910
taught how to be mentors we're not

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,950
taught how to be experts we're just

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,630
figuring out as we go along and so there

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,590
are lots of pitfalls here that are very

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,860
easy to fall into it's also true that

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,360
you have stuff to do right you have a

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,150
job and if someone comes in and

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,470
interrupts you and ask you a question

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,550
it's taking away time for what you're

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,720
working on otherwise and that's really

00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,660
challenging I totally want to

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,550
acknowledge that up front but teams that

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,460
are really successful know that this is

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,260
the job that helping their team be

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,870
successful in helping everyone work to

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,450
their full capacity is the work to do

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,680
that is the role so even though it can

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,910
be really frustrating in the moment to

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,220
put down your own thing and help someone

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,420
else try to take a step back and look at

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,630
the big picture and that can really help

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,380
sort of like reframe that interaction

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,690
one other thing that makes this

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,010
challenging is the curse of knowledge

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,450
being an expert can actually make it

00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,070
very difficult to remember what it's

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,720
like to not understand what a variable

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,130
is a variable is a very challenging

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,170
concept to people have never programmed

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,790
before and you can forget that very

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,130
easily when you spend all day in an IDE

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,050
or at the command line or whatever

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,400
knowing something super well it makes it

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,020
really hard to remember what it was like

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,540
before and that can make it very hard to

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,850
help them and very frustrating you've

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,070
all probably helped people who are new

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,670
to technology my father used to help his

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,050
his father use his MacBook Air and they

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,450
would just end up shouting at each other

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,950
on skype about what was happening

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,210
because it was very confusing for my

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,100
grandfather and my father was having

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,840
trouble explaining because my father has

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,330
used Apple products since like they were

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,220
black and white and like you know this

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,600
the se like since the 90s he's always

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,010
been a huge Apple fan so he couldn't

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,210
remember what it was like to not use one

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,620
and that led to a lot of conflict so

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,010
think about every question you get as an

00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,150
opportunity to make your team stronger

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,100
try to listen to what they're saying and

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,260
remember that you don't might not know

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,180
where they're coming from and when you

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,130
get stumped especially in front of other

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,770
people model not knowing

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,380
model not knowing the answer I have a

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,720
question asking superhero in mind when I

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,730
was writing this slide and it's a former

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,140
co-worker of mine named Dean who I don't

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,049
even know if he's he knows I'm saying

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,110
this about him but Dean was a senior

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:18,570
engineer and he was his title and he was

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,429
very good at in public in front of the

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,410
rest the engineering team being like huh

00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,179
so I see that you're doing this thing

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,880
here but how does this work

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,320
and then just stopping and just asking

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,470
like it was a totally normal question

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,419
and this blew my mind this was a model

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,100
of asking questions and not knowing

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,600
something that I really hadn't seen very

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,929
much in the technical community it's

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,240
really powerful and very scary but makes

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,809
a big difference so here are some really

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,049
specific tools you can use to help one

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:51,539
is welcome questions so when people ask

00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:53,100
you questions be welcoming smile put

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,500
down your stuff and don't look at it and

00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,780
do as you can to welcome them if you're

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,820
not getting enough questions you can

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,980
reward question askers and I don't mean

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,409
with candy but that might work too I

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,780
mean just emotionally like be like

00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:10,260
that's a great question be excited about

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:12,299
what they're working on and you might

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,070
want to read this book this is a book

00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,270
called don't shoot the dog the new art

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,240
of teaching and training it's a book

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:22,289
about dog training I read it a few years

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,000
ago and it's awesome it's called this

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:25,500
because if your dog is barking and you

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,840
want it to stop there are a lot of ways

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,179
you can get a dog to stop barking method

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,490
one is shoot the dog the book does not

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,840
recommend this method they're like we

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,179
have seven other methods that are better

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,860
but it is an option you could lock your

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,960
door you could hide you could you know

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,120
refuse to help someone but there are

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,830
lots of other ones this book is also

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,740
great a little bit of a tangent here

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,270
this book is also great because for each

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,860
example of the methods it talks about

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,380
it's like here to use here's how to use

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,260
this on a dog here's how to use this on

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,809
people here's how to get your spouse to

00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,840
pick up their laundry off the floor you

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:02,820
can use it on yourself too I use it on

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,610
myself even though I know I'm doing it

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,780
if I'm like trying to add a new habit to

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,970
my life like go to the gym in the

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,940
morning if I put on my gym shoes you

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,960
know before the Sun's up I just go yes I

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,210
give myself a little

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,559
ward it really works it's very strange

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,409
but it works really well so read this

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,399
book it's awesome so in case you've

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:22,590
forgotten what we were talking about

00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:24,750
here not enough questions reward the

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,830
question asking give a timely positive

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,740
reward for someone who asks you

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,120
questions the flip side of that is you

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,020
might be getting too many questions you

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,390
might be getting someone that's just

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,010
pestering you all the time if they're in

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,710
their first few months on the job just

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,299
deal with that if it's not if it's like

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,460
really something you need to adjust you

00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,559
can shape their behavior you can teach

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,320
them how to fish you can teach them

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,870
where to look for help you can teach

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,529
them to catch common errors or show them

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,880
how to debug and debug more effectively

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:56,100
this is one that I borrowed from the

00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,779
Flatiron school and they have four

00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,399
things you have to do in order before

00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:04,230
you can ask the teacher for help

00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:07,440
thing one google it a love thing to read

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,450
the error message surprising how often

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,429
putting that there actually fixes the

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,140
problem step three is ask another

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,360
student and then you can ask the teacher

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,100
for help but this is one way they've cut

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,679
down on the high volume of questions

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,840
that the teachers were asking the

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,340
teachers were asked and it teaches them

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,870
how to get help when they leave the

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,010
program so they're prepared to be more

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,090
effective developers on their own

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,010
another thing to keep in mind is that

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,539
and this is one I got from I think Dale

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,429
Carnegie who wrote how to win friends

00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,230
and influence people but people will

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,730
always remember how you made them feel

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,000
that emotional side and this is sort of

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,799
where that little voice comes in again

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,169
so there are a few like corollaries of

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:47,669
this one is a rule I've stolen from

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,039
hacker school and this is where the

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:51,929
social guideline guide rails come in

00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:54,510
these are basically lightweight rules to

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,919
help you to not be a jerk without

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,500
meaning to because we all mean well

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
right but if you're like oh you haven't

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,570
heard of the global interpreter lock

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,220
that accomplishes nothing it just makes

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,840
the other person feel dumb for not

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,090
already knowing it doesn't inform them

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,490
it doesn't help them it just makes that

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,820
little voice a little bit louder so try

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:17,370
not to feign surprise another thing you

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,250
can do is assume competence this is one

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,350
that is particularly pernicious I found

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,990
that when I am in certain environments

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,620
people assume that

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,970
I'm a beginner or that I need to start

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,410
learning with an easy language and I

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,850
have lots of stories about this but

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,380
assume that people are competent and

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,600
then know what they're doing

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,270
Echo's a really long way as well one

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,240
question to help you avoid getting into

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:44,120
this kind of a trap is how familiar are

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,640
you with blank before launching into a

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,290
lecture on it this would have come in

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,410
really handy with a former co-worker of

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:55,460
mine who started explaining code I wrote

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,230
to me if he had asked and said how

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,809
familiar are you with this part of the

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,080
code base I would have said I wrote it

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:05,929
and then he wouldn't have looked so dumb

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,620
so use this question this is magical it

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:11,570
helps you avoid that dynamic one other

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,580
corollary of the feelings bit is to

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,190
praise in public and criticize in

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,660
private this one is again paying

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,790
attention to that little voice and it's

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,440
just really respectful there's one quote

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,679
that I love I got from Alice Bartlett's

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,950
blogpost about her first days at the at

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,110
the GDS which is a digital agency in the

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,640
UK and she it's great because she's

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,080
talking about how scared she was of the

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,429
fridge her first week and how she

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,350
doesn't remember being that scared at

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:37,910
all and she says if I'm giving feedback

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,710
in a pull request I always go find the

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,020
person first and check how they'd best

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,210
like the feedback sometimes offer to

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,610
pair with them on it in private email

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,020
them in private or maybe just comment on

00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,429
the pull request and she always thinks

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,929
it's polite to give people options

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,010
so that's may or may not work for your

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:55,010
workflow but it's something at least

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,690
worth considering one other thing you

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:59,360
can do is to share the how and the why

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,309
not just the what don't just answer the

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,010
question show them how you knew what

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,510
turn to type in the Ghul do you know how

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,980
to solve that bug because there's some

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,110
concept you understand that they don't

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,730
or is it just because you've run into

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,230
that bug a hundred million times before

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,670
and you just have to run into it a

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,429
hundred million times before you know

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,050
the book so share what your thinking is

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:19,700
and how you're making decisions this is

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,130
can really go a long way to how it's

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,160
helping people solve problems on their

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,050
own this is a small one but makes a big

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,820
difference don't grab the steering wheel

00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,490
so don't just reach over and grab their

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,840
keyboard just ask first just ask and

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,309
you'll avoid this one this one's very it

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,410
feels very invasive to have someone grab

00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:37,200
your keyboard from you this one I got

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,549
from the

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,279
the railsbridge teacher workshop

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,870
railsbridge is a workshop that teaches

00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:45,809
beginners rails and Ruby on a weekend

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:48,210
and they they have this rule

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:51,269
another one is watch your language and I

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:56,760
don't mean swearing I mean words like

00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:58,139
easy just obviously these words are

00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,970
particularly infuriating if you're

00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:02,010
frustrated I remember working with a

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,990
tool that was very confusing li

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,760
structured and their documentation was

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,830
completely unhelpful and the word

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,779
obviously was in it and I actually

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,260
shouted at my computer I was like it's

00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:15,029
not obvious because it wasn't though you

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,440
did it they've done a terrible job of

00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:18,480
structuring this thing so I could figure

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,860
out how to use this tool and they put

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,570
the word obviously and it's just adding

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,190
insult to injury because if it's obvious

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,260
to you you don't need the word obvious

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,090
and if it's not obvious to you then

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,039
you're insulting someone so just try to

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,139
remove easy Justin obviously in those

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,260
sorts of words from your explanations

00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:36,149
and your documentation especially one

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,179
other to remember is to a moat in

00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:40,470
writing because especially with people

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,880
you don't know on the Internet

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:48,690
github type discussions you know like

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,399
comments on pull requests and issues if

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,889
you are trying to be constructive and

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,110
trying to be helpful sometimes that can

00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:56,880
be not come across what you say and what

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,409
you're thinking the tone you mean can be

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,389
misinterpreted by someone else I know

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:02,789
you all know this but just try to over a

00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:05,100
moat a little bit more I love emojis for

00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:07,590
this add a little bit more encouraging

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,059
words around the thing you're trying to

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,950
say this can go a really long way

00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:12,720
towards building people who will maybe

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,269
become maintainer xand your pull request

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,340
prod maintainer xin submit pull requests

00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:19,519
to your projects and you can really

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,260
build great community this way as well

00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:27,000
there's one other hacker school social

00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:29,730
rule which is no well actually I've

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,260
heard this coming out of my mouth naming

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,200
it is really powerful because then when

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,679
you catch yourself going well actually

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,159
you can go

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,529
oh no and stop yourself from saying it

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,880
so just to be clear oh well actually is

00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:44,190
not a correction of something that

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,720
matters it's a distraction from the main

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,190
topic and it's something that comes from

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,139
really good habits in software

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,610
engineering if we put a comma in the

00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:51,150
wrong place the production server goes

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,559
down

00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,930
so attention to detail is really

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,880
important but if you carry that over to

00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,100
social situations it can be less

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,420
constructive so when I was driving

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,820
across the Golden Gate Bridge the other

00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,320
day actually it was the Bay Bridge like

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,960
no one cares you just ruined the story

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,820
so this is a particularly destructive

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,160
one the light weight social rule there

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,140
helps you stop not be an a jerk

00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,660
accidentally and this one's really great

00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,940
as well so the last one I'll leave you

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,559
with here is an advanced move so use it

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,080
with caution but I would love to see

00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,730
more people doing this instead of

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,710
coddling people that you think are

00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,780
beginners or you think are new instead

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,750
of trying to point them in an easier

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,550
direction push them push them a little

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,890
bit hard and farther than they think

00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,059
they can go and then support them when

00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,550
they struggle because they will that's

00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,750
how you learn this one can be an

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,550
advanced move because if you push them

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,380
too hard or too far it can discourage

00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,360
them and backfire so use this one with

00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,309
caution but if you think someone is

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,990
capable of more push them a little bit

00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:51,080
see where their limits are and encourage

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:56,220
them to step outside their comfort zone

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,880
so to sum up welcome questions make them

00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,370
feel good

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,620
share the how and the why of how you all

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,660
know all the stuff you know ask for the

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,460
wheel before you take it and watch your

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,840
language and how you talk it can make a

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,190
really really big difference so I asked

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,500
you for a reason why you came in in the

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,450
beginning what are you gonna take home

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,740
hopefully I've given you something you

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,300
can use on Monday morning when you get

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,370
