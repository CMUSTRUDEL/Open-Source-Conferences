	"Speaker: Tom Christie

Think there's nothing left to explore in how we design Web API frameworks? Think again.

The author of Django REST framework walks through how we might approach designing a new Python-based API framework from scratch, and looks at how we can start building smarter, more productive API tooling as a result.

You should come away from this talk with a better appreciation of:

* How best to provide API client libraries and API documentation to your users.
* How to build APIs that support both realtime and request/response interfaces.
* How to build APIs that are web-browsable.
* Why you might want to consider taking a schema-first approach to your API design.
