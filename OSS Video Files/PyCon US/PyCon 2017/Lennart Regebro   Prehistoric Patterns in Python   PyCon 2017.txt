Why do some code use dictionaries that have None for all values? Is it true that you shouldn't concatenate strings with +? Will Python optimize constant calculations?

This talk will go through some patterns that used to be common in Python, but which now are regarded as outdated and see if they really are outdated and why. The results surprised me, maybe they'll surprise you.
