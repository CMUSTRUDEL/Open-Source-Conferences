It's not easy to write libraries with great APIs. We're aware of that. However, it's not always clear how we can follow abstract ideals like elegance, simplicity, and extensibility to improve our APIs. That's why in this talk we'll discuss good and bad APIs with real-world examples. For each thing learned, we'll come up with a checklist to help us with practical advice for writing good APIs.
