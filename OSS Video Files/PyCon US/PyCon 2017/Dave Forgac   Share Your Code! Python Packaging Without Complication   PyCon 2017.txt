If you want people to use your code you should package it! You may have heard that packaging is hard but the Python packaging ecosystem has evolved a lot over the years. Taking your beautiful code and sharing it with the world is complex but it doesn't have to be complicated. In this talk you will learn how to take advantage of modern tooling and practices so you can get boring stuff out of the way, publish quickly and frequently, and focus on your code.

This talk will cover:

- A (brief) history of Python packaging
- Python Packaging User Guide recommendations
- Distribution formats
- Anatomy of a package
- Automating package creation
- Adding:
  - Testing
  - CI
  - Documentation
- Testing package installation
- Releasing to PyPI

This talk is for you if you're new to Python packaging and would like to learn how to share you code or if you've worked with Python for a while and just aren't up-to-date with the latest packaging practices.
