Description: 
	"Speaker: Daniele Procida

Nearly everyone (especially in the Python community) agrees that good documentation is important to the success of software projects, and yet very few projects actually have good documentation.

Often, it's _not for want of effort_ - the project's developers have worked hard on it - _nor for lack of documentation_ - the authors have produced a lot of it. 

_It simply turns out to be not very good_ - not helpful enough for the users who should be able to rely on it, and a depressing chore for the authors who have to maintain it.

The good news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding _how documentation works_, and what its different functions are. Structuring documentation according to those distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain.

Using real-life examples I'll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort.

I won't be discussing documentation tools or software or other topics that have been covered amply elsewhere, but some neglected aspects of software documentation that **will make your software projects more successful**.

welcome everyone next speaker is Dan

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,910
la Prada and diagnosis talk is how

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,829
documentation works and how to make it

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,829
work for your project - please welcome

00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,059
hi everyone thank you for coming and as

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,940
you see I've changed the title for about

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,170
the 15th time so it's not as advertised

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,809
same same content and thank you to the

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,550
PyCon organizers for inviting me to

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,379
speak here and of course to the

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,760
volunteers who are running around all

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,769
over the place doing lots of work on

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,720
behalf of everyone and thank you to

00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:57,030
Carol who's doing the speech tests

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,729
speech to text transcription there

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,500
quietly on the side so the that's a

00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:13,110
fantastic job that's being done through

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:14,729
this conference and that's me that's

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,320
what I look like in case you need to

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:23,450
recognize me later and I work at devio a

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:28,009
cloud we do cloud hosting for Python and

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:33,780
Django project comm is our

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:35,549
website and the idea of our product is

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,710
that Django and Python developers

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,490
shouldn't need to be DevOps or system

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,990
administrators to get their projects

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,759
onto the web so if you like to talk to

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,969
me about that later please please do and

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:53,130
I work with Django I'm a member of the

00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,850
Django core development team and I'm a

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,159
board member of the Django Software

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,249
Foundation and those are my contact

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,299
details so feel free to drop me a line

00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:10,350
by email or just come and talk to me now

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,599
that you know what I look like so I'll

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,280
start by telling you something that you

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,190
knew perfectly well already which is

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,050
that better documentation will make your

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:24,030
project more successful so it's nice to

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,710
have something that everybody agrees

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,780
with already I feel that we've got

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,190
something in common now it's like bonded

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,640
a bit already you know

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:37,140
it's a it's like if you have a if you're

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
in a minor car accident with somebody

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,070
you bond with them immediately well you

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,740
know we can bond over this and anyway

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,590
the point is that when you share your

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,940
software with the world you want the

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,970
world to use it but many projects and

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,350
authors fall foul of a very simple

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,990
principle that it doesn't actually

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,030
matter how good your software is because

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,690
if the documentation is not quite up to

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,290
the job

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,350
the world will obstinately refuse to use

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,910
your software and so if it's not good

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,370
enough or in the worst case your

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,990
documentation doesn't even exist the

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,820
world is going to decide that the

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,190
project is just too much trouble

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,530
even to discover and we'll find

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,110
something else to solve its problems

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,510
with and even if you can somehow force

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,710
the world to use your software at least

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,990
some of the people in the world like

00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:32,550
maybe your colleagues or your henchmen

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:34,350
and without good documentation even your

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,220
henchmen I'm not going to use your

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:45,780
software very well we all have henchmen

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:48,660
yeah so most people understand all this

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,630
and most people try very hard to create

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,970
good documentation and they know that

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,910
they need it and that's what they aim

00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,180
for and unfortunately most people fail

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,820
to achieve that really because they

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,850
don't try hard enough and usually just

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,430
because they're not doing it in the

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,709
right way and what I hope to explain in

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,560
this talk is how you can make your

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:17,549
documentation better not by working

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,650
harder at it not by making any more of

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,500
it possibly not even by writing a single

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,419
word more but by doing it the right way

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,440
and it's good news because the right way

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,090
is actually an easier way to do it it's

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,980
easier to write documentation like this

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:37,550
and it's easier to maintain it and there

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,900
are some very simple basic principles of

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,139
the governed documentation that are very

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,569
rarely spelled out and

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,120
they seem to be secret so of course they

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:53,509
should not be and I want to spell them

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:59,599
out so that they stop being secrets we

00:04:53,509 --> 00:05:02,469
have problem okay the local taxi

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,469
companies are coming through

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:56,020
okay so um there are these principles

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,840
which have the status of sequencing that

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,620
nobody seems to know what they are and

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,680
my promise is that if you can put these

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,870
secret principles into practice if you

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:13,990
can learn to use them it will make your

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,300
documentation better and that will make

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,590
your project or your product or your

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:23,219
team more successful so here's the

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,400
secret that there is not just one thing

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:32,050
called documentation there are four

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,240
things that are documentation and they

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,110
represent four different purposes or

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,650
functions and here they are tutorials

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:46,750
how-to guides reference and discussions

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:49,360
and what I'm arguing is that

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,000
documentation needs to include and to be

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,460
explicitly structured around these four

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,610
different functions each of which

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:01,180
requires a distinct mode of writing and

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,069
people working with software need each

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,159
of these four different kinds of

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,599
documentation at different times in

00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:10,389
different circumstances and they're all

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,279
usually necessary in your documentation

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,339
what's more they must all be kept

00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,979
separate and distinct from each other

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,080
keeping them entirely separate is key to

00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,080
creating successful documentation and

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,210
making it easy to maintain this

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,060
structure makes it obvious to both the

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,860
author and the reader what information

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,479
goes where it tells the author how to

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,889
write and what to write and where to

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,870
write it it saves the author from

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,719
wasting a great deal of time trying to

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,490
work out where to put things - how to

00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:42,039
trying to work out how to wrestle the

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,750
information into a shape that makes

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,180
sense

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:49,180
because here we have a structure in

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:53,349
which each part of the quadrant has one

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,680
and only one very clear job so let's

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:59,419
start with them going

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,419
let's start going through them in order

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:08,220
to toriel's are lessons that take your

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,220
reader by the hand through a series of

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,949
steps to complete a project or

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,870
meaningful exercise of some kind now

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,910
what your project needs to show the

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,410
beginner that they can achieve something

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:25,229
with it and the main purpose is to give

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,850
the new user of your software the best

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:35,760
possible start tutorials are oriented

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:39,500
towards the users learning so think

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,209
about teaching a young child to cook

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,000
what you teach the child to cook isn't

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,350
really important what's important what's

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,540
important is that the child finds it

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,930
enjoyable and gave us confidence and

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,300
wants to do it again and it's through

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,420
the things the child does that it will

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,709
learn through the things that it does it

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,209
will learn important things about

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,830
cooking including some things that you

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:05,360
take for granted for example that you

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,500
wash your hands before you handle food

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,510
so there are various things that matter

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:17,459
both in teaching a child to cook and in

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:21,360
your documentation tutorials and using

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,300
software like cooking is a craft or

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,600
skill and when we learn a new craft or

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,250
skill we learn it by doing as if you've

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,230
ever watched a child learn something you

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,850
will know the child learns things by

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,610
doing it that's how beginners learn

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,360
things they're gaining not theoretical

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,100
knowledge but practical knowledge and

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,320
the point of the tutorial is to get

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,790
started not to become an expert or get

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,850
to the end of the journey but just to

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,640
get started on that journey a tutorial

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,730
has to inspire confidence of someone

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,140
who's not used it before confidence in

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,959
your documentation confidence in the

00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,480
software confidence in you as a teacher

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,060
and confidence in their own abilities

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,970
and for this happen what you ask them to

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,400
do must work and it must be repeatable

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,250
so it must work every time for everybody

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,500
in

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,120
every circumstance whatever operating

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,610
system they're using whatever tools

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,690
they're using and so on and this is very

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,960
difficult because things keep changing

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:23,190
updating all the time it has to provide

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,420
an immediate sense of achievement

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,700
everything the learner does should

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,770
accomplish something that's

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,570
comprehensible and meaningful however

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:37,600
small it might be tutorials need to be

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:40,570
concrete built around specific

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,760
particular actions and outcomes because

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,510
learning proceeds from the particular

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,260
and the concrete to the general and the

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,300
abstract and not the other way around

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:57,490
when you're doing a tutorial you do not

00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:00,820
need to explain things so go for the

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,980
absolute minimum necessary explanation

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,960
don't explain anything that the learner

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,050
does not need to know right now and

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,250
don't distract the learner with options

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,070
or choices or alternatives so your job

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,570
here is to ensure that having done the

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,820
tutorial the learner is now in a

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,960
position to start making sense of the

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,620
rest of the documentation and the

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,089
software itself and most software

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,520
projects have really bad or even

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,530
non-existent tutorials tutorials will

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,420
turn your learners into users and a

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,430
battle missing tutorial will prevent

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,620
your project from acquiring new users

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:39,030
there the hardest thing to write and to

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,370
maintain and most projects lack adequate

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:45,880
tutorials and are losing users as a

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,350
result so next how to guides these are

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,990
guides that take a reader through the

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:56,530
steps required to solve some common

00:11:49,990 --> 00:12:00,880
problem and specific real-world problems

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:02,740
here they are recipes directions to

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,280
achieve some specific end for example

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,890
how to create a web form or how to plot

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,560
a three dimensional data set or how to

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:17,620
enable LDAP authentication so they're

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:20,709
all problem oriented and what matters in

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,080
them are the same things that matters in

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,760
a recipe for cooking something so if you

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,740
if you want to know an analogy there it

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,270
is think about a recipe for preparing

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,490
something to eat which has a clear

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,820
defined end it addresses a specific

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,310
question how do I prepare this dish how

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,860
to guides are completely distinct from

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,590
tutorials how to guide is an answer to a

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,810
question that a real beginner might not

00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,500
even be able to formulate in the

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,750
tutorial

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,430
you know what the problems are and you

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,710
decide for the beginner what needs to be

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,210
achieved in the how-to guide the user

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,660
has the problems in the questions and

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,340
you're the one supplying the answers how

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,260
do you guys tend to be done fairly well

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,740
in software documentation they're quite

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,110
fun to write and briefly what matters

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,820
here is a series of steps a list of

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,640
things that need to be done in order

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:14,580
just like in tutorials to achieve the

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:17,590
result and focus on some specific

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,230
practical goal or problem and what the

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:24,040
user needs to do to get there anything

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:26,740
else is a distraction how-to guide has

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:31,750
to address a specific question how do I

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:35,680
do such-and-such again

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,340
there's no place for explanation in how

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,030
to guide explanations get in the way of

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,470
action how to guide have to have enough

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,390
flexibility that the user can see how

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,880
these steps might apply to a very

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,790
slightly different set of circumstances

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,950
or a slightly different need you don't

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,930
want to lock the user to being to do

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:59,650
only exactly that thing that you're

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,670
doing but to know the steps to do

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,360
something that they can then use a

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,490
springboard for moving on practical

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,350
usability is much more important than

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,330
completeness you don't have to cover

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,560
every detail of detail of every step

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,510
because you can make some assumptions

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,640
about that your user already knows some

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,740
things and you don't have to mention

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,940
that's everything you don't have to

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:24,040
mention everything that's related to

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:27,040
this topic and finally good naming helps

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,260
so some topic like how to create a

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,380
class-based view is a good title but

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,500
creating class-based views is not a good

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,700
title and class-based views is an even

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,140
worse title because it

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,370
tell you what the guide is about we

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,260
don't need to spend any more time on

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,110
this because this is the stuff that gets

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,820
done the best um

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,710
reference guides are technical

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,890
descriptions of the machinery and how to

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:56,640
operate it they have only one job to

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,570
describe their code determined and

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,310
because ultimately that's what they

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,130
describe things like keep classes or

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,380
functions or api's they'll tell you

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,230
they'll give you facts like a Django

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,030
model is a Python class this is how you

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,310
create a model these are the available

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,880
model fields this is how you instantiate

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:19,870
their model class and reference material

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,250
is information oriented so it needs to

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,980
list things like classes and functions

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,890
and attributes and methods by all means

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,100
it can contain examples as illustrations

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,640
but its job is not to to explain basic

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,710
concepts or explain how to achieve

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,110
common tasks it should be austere and

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,890
get straight to the point

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,660
and here's another analogy and

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,120
Encyclopedia article about n an

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:50,320
ingredient can you where it comes from

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,790
what if properties are what its what

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,900
chemicals it contains how it behaves

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,090
what matters in your reference

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,980
documentation is that it has the same

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,900
structure as the code base so that the

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,740
user can navigate the code and the

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,560
documentation at the same time and the

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,940
author can do the same thing to

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,040
consistency matters in reference guide

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:17,110
tone structure format language must all

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,270
be it as consistent as possible as

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:24,520
consistent as an reference material

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,440
would be in for example an actual

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,070
encyclopedia or dictionary or other

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:33,340
reference text it only has one job to

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,710
describe the machinery as clearly and

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,440
completely as possible anything else

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:40,390
like explanation or discussion or

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,330
instructional speculation or opinion is

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:46,360
not only a distraction but will make it

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,290
harder to maintain the reference

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,089
documentation

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,560
and of course it has to be completely

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,410
accurate and up-to-date because

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,680
otherwise the user is going to have

00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:02,389
information that is incorrect and will

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,299
make things break for them for some

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,679
developers this is all they imagine when

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,350
they think about documentation they

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,230
think that all documentation is

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:14,059
technical reference they already

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,799
understand their software and how to use

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:20,059
it all they can imagine other people

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:23,390
needing is some technical details about

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,650
it and so that's all they write and then

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,030
of course because they haven't made

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,919
space for the other things that are

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,840
necessary those other things like

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,940
explanation and discussion in an

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,980
instruction and how-to guides find their

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,530
way into the reference material and then

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,620
make the reference material less

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,790
effective and here's the final quadrant

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,780
discussions or explanations I'm I keep

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,330
not being sure whether to call them

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,429
discussions or explanations discussions

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,220
are explanations that clarify and

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:55,429
illuminate a particular topic they are

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,620
oriented towards understanding they're a

00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:00,890
chance for the documentation to relax

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:04,400
and step back from the software taking a

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:08,179
wide of wider view of it and here's our

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,010
analogy a book that includes historical

00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:13,010
and scientific and sociological and

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,240
other background discussion of food and

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,490
cooking so you know if you want to find

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,440
out whether Romans used Forks or how

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:23,570
they fried their eggs then that's the

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,610
kind it is it's it's from a distance but

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:29,750
it gives you a context and background

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,770
that's very valuable and that's a book

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,679
that's certainly worth reading by the

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,710
way he'll Harold McGee and explanations

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,360
are the place for background and context

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,840
web forms and how they are handled in

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:46,040
django search and using searching Django

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,679
CMS and they should explain why things

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,950
are the way they are for example design

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:57,049
decisions historical reasons accidents

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,299
they can consider alternatives or

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,580
multiple approaches they can even even

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:06,490
consider different opinions

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:09,500
on the same topic even contrary opinions

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,740
they should make connections that help

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,350
the user join the dots between different

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,360
things that make sense of the subject

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,740
see how something stands in relation to

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,220
other things the user may know about

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,450
already and in keeping with what we've

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,890
said before about keeping things

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,850
separate they're not the place for

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,820
instruction for telling people how to do

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,350
things or for technical description

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,640
they're not so easy to write because

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,930
when you're doing a how-to guide for

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,200
example you've got a question in front

00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:42,620
of you or a tutorial you've got a clear

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,880
goal when it comes to writing discussion

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,240
documents you're the one who's got to

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,830
decide where to begin and end the

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,720
discussion and what it should include

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,940
and that's not always so easy to do when

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:58,180
you have a blank page staring you in the

00:19:52,940 --> 00:20:01,430
face so these are the four quadrants of

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:04,790
software documentation and as soon as

00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,070
and the things that should be in one of

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,840
them start appearing in another the

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,540
quality of the documentation as a whole

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,430
begins to fall in other words if you add

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,350
new material to your documentation and

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,510
you add it into the wrong place you're

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,630
going to make your documentation worse

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,490
not better it'll be less useful to the

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:27,130
reader and harder for the author to

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,990
maintain and then it will look like that

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,390
and the thing is it's actually really

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,310
hard to keep these things apart and

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,870
that's partly because of the way in

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,360
which their various characteristics

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,930
overlap so here they are on each one

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,970
neatly in its own quadrant but in fact

00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,350
we can see that tutorials and how-to

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,990
guides are similar because they're both

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,590
concerned with describing practical

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,140
steps and what how-to guides share with

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,760
reference material is that they're most

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,200
useful when we're actually sitting front

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,000
in front of the code trying to do

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,070
something and what reference material

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,250
shares with discussions is that they're

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,890
concerned with theoretical knowledge and

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,990
what discussions share with tutorials is

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:13,310
that their most useful when we are

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,400
studying rather than actually coding so

00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,760
this is

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,760
who kind of interactions of

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,520
gravitational pull between them which

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,900
leads towards this it's really no wonder

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,440
it's not a surprise that documentation

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,550
ends up looking like that but that's

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,410
what it should look like if you want to

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,610
take a picture now that's you know by

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:38,760
all means come and take a close-up

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:41,400
because that's the secret okay so that

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,100
you see the clear layout of the quadrant

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,300
and also the tensions that exist in it

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:51,420
that tend towards the blurring of the

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,470
boundaries and don't be shy going stand

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,200
in front with the blurring of the

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,110
boundaries and the appearance of the

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,490
wrong things in the wrong places but

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,530
when you manage to achieve that

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,660
structure you'll have documentation that

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,360
will work that's easier to write right

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:10,500
and to maintain that's easier to use and

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,540
to find your way around in and it's not

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,870
gonna write itself sadly because it

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:19,050
never does but you'll have a much

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:22,140
clearer idea of what to write how to

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:24,390
write it and where to put it and your

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,309
users will be served better because for

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,190
all the different phases in the cycle of

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:31,320
their interaction with your software

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,990
they will find the right kind of

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:40,470
documentation that will serve the needs

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:42,990
of their moment without making them pick

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:48,450
their way through things that get in

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:50,550
their way and your software will attract

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,679
and keep more users it will turn your

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,980
learner's into users who will use it

00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,740
more effectively and having people who

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:04,429
use your software effectively is really

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:08,490
what the programmer wants most of all

00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:10,830
I've written this up with some with

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,640
quite a lot more material there be

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:17,130
Viacom slash blog / documentation so if

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,520
you're interested you can go and find

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,420
that and read it at your leisure and

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,570
actually be very interested in having

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,520
feedback from people on this goes up as

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,630
far as I'm aware this is a fairly new

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,960
idea I haven't heard anybody

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,960
this out in the same way before so

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,820
opinions and critical feedback would

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,460
actually be very useful so I'd be very

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,770
please come and talk to me that's what I

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,050
look like on television you can talk to

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,820
me about dvo or Django or darker eyes

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:52,540
Django deployments or documentation or

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:57,580
anything else that begins with B please

00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:59,260
email me or come and find me and thank

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,370
you very much for listening I'm really

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,370
happy to have any questions

00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:16,049
put that back a bit for you hi thank you

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,249
for that talk it's I think it's a really

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:19,950
important subject and open-source

00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:21,840
software one of the most common things

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,429
that people ask me is well why can't all

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,489
our documentation just be in the form of

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:28,739
Stack Overflow answers and questions so

00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:30,299
because that's really easy I agree that

00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:32,190
that's really important where do you

00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:34,769
think question-answer forums fit into

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,220
the documentation problem that's

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,389
actually a very good example because I

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,399
don't think the Stack Overflow is is a

00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:43,139
good way of documenting things but the

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:46,950
questions that appear on something like

00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:49,559
Stack Overflow give you a very good idea

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,749
for example about what how-to guides

00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,019
might be missing and if the Stack

00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:56,549
Overflow questions are about things like

00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:59,129
just getting started in the basics if

00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:01,019
they reveal that people are floundering

00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:03,749
around even getting started then you

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,070
know that your tutorials are not

00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,409
adequate in fact your tutorials are

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:12,690
probably not adequate anyway all of you

00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:15,450
yes so it's very useful as a pointer but

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,519
definitely it's it's not a substitute

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,559
for documentation which has to be

00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,960
structured nobody has will have

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,249
confidence in you or your project

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,859
because there's a lot of questions on

00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:29,190
Stack Overflow so that answer your

00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,330
question I mean if people are insisting

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,909
that that's good enough you can just

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:40,409
tell them quit limit my article and then

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:41,519
they'll know that they're wrong I'm

00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:42,600
sorry I'm not hearing you very well

00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,710
which probably means other people aren't

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,029
either can you hear me now yes okay this

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,450
question actually segues really well

00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:52,889
from that one what are your thoughts on

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,600
documentation being replaced by BOTS

00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:56,100
entirely and what I mean by that is we

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,509
create an ontology for your

00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,580
documentation like you've started out

00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,929
with four big pieces right and you

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,309
divide it down so when you're creating

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:03,960
the document you're really creating

00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,789
nuggets if I see as opposed to entire

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,559
pages and so the consumption is

00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,749
completely bought model where you know

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,879
it's driven based on what you want to

00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:14,669
read as opposed to what the author wants

00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:18,149
you to read now I completely disagree

00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:21,799
with that some enough and for me that

00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:21,799
one of the most important things are the

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:28,239
tutorials and I used to be a high school

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,080
teacher so one of the things that I

00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:34,899
learnt at great pain is that when

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,679
somebody is learning something they need

00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:41,980
to be doing things not being told things

00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,409
so you have the responsibility of being

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,210
a teacher leading a student leading a

00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:47,739
learner through a program that you have

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,799
devised because you know where it's

00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:53,950
going to go and there's no only humans

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:57,429
can do that at the moment so and even

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,850
humans don't do that very well just

00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,989
finish so what if it wasn't as

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,970
mechanical as it would sound what if it

00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:06,940
was actually conversational would you

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,440
would that be better or are you so not

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,489
on this the machine can have an overall

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,049
concept of what it is let me take a

00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:22,269
teacher child to cook and then you'll

00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:23,739
see what I mean I I your organization

00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:26,379
totally makes sense as a reader of

00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:28,899
documentation like it's fantastic it

00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:31,509
makes a lot of sense as someone writing

00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:33,519
the documentation and writing the code I

00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:34,869
think one reason stuff ends up

00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,909
everything in the in the reference

00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:38,230
section is because that's the part that

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,419
you know you need to update when you

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,249
change something do you have any

00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,109
recommendations on how to know that you

00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:46,720
also broke it tutorial when you change

00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:48,970
something in the code sorry if you have

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,999
any recommendations on how like systems

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,460
so that yeah you change something in the

00:27:51,999 --> 00:28:00,460
code how do you know that you broke how

00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:02,859
to yeah and well how to's are are easier

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,019
but the tutorials are really difficult

00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:06,879
because the users got to be able to

00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:08,259
start at the beginning and work through

00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:10,480
it and get right to the end and every

00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:13,149
time they do something it has to work

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,919
because if it doesn't work this person

00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:19,330
is a learner a new person now you've

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,879
invited them to use your software and

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,549
left them floundering around so you just

00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:29,019
have to keep at vivia one thing we do we

00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,369
have I think it's every week somebody in

00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:32,859
the company goes through one of our

00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:35,110
tutorials from beginning to end and does

00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:37,780
all the steps as a beginner would and

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:43,809
that just is really hard work so biggest

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:46,360
of hard work so I am a big documentation

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:49,240
writer for the company I work for and

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,059
I'm on my second knowledge base from

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,070
scratch at this point and one of the

00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:57,370
problems I constantly have this adoption

00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,309
is getting other engineers to inform the

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:03,760
standards so that the documentation is

00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:06,340
easy to read and easy to follow

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,450
so my question I pose to you is if you

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,190
had to sell someone on the importance of

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,290
standardization within a knowledge base

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:17,230
for example just documentation in

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:18,850
general but their argument to you every

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,010
time you gave them an explanation was

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,020
that's too hard even if it's two steps

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,820
that's too hard what would you say to

00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:30,190
them I would say that this actually

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:31,870
makes things significantly easier that

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,669
makes it much easier to write and

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,610
maintain documentation you can achieve

00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,200
that right now by just shifting around

00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,150
your existing documentation without

00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,500
adding without having to write anything

00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,809
new just taking things out of the wrong

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,520
place and putting them where they belong

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:51,160
the way I introduced this for some of

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:53,470
our documentation is I merged my own

00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,580
pull request said our documentation is

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,630
structured in this way as confesseth and

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,669
from then on it was structured in that

00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,010
way so sometimes you just have to start

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:05,260
doing things it's amazingly it's amazing

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,549
what people will believe if they see it

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,010
written down in the documentation on the

00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,330
very first page well so I guess the

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,830
question is do you feel like the

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,500
effectiveness of the documentation

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,440
justifies the requirements that exist

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,110
before it's created so if it may be

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,049
difficult to create you feel like by

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,900
having it be effective it supports the

00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:28,330
need to have standardization and people

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,970
seem to from your experience people seem

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,350
to agree to use standards more often if

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,370
they notice that it works

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,750
I mean no words it is kind of a toss-up

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,419
if you're trying to sell somebody the

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,679
idea of good documentation then that's a

00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:44,590
slightly different problem

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,440
I mean if they agree that they need good

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,730
documentation then which most people do

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,710
yeah then

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,169
you can say here's a scheme that does

00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,970
work you'll find this by the way in

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:56,470
Django's documentation okay where I make

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,270
sure that it says right on the first

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,070
page of the documentation go and have a

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,410
look at jenga's documentation you'll see

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:06,900
that this structure is clearly spelled

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:10,900
out or Django CMS - okay cool thank you

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,790
we just have one question so if you have

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,770
any more questions please please come to

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,169
and aquas they'll be very handy or noisy

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,600
questions yes can you comment briefly on

00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:22,150
the kind of metrics that you would be

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,190
looking for to get in to gauge the

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,679
success of different documentation types

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,570
and I say this because I've had to argue

00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:30,400
over the years of the value of a

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,049
discussion because they don't get a lot

00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,669
of page hits because you read them once

00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:34,990
and then you're done yeah you don't have

00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:37,809
to read them over and over like a

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,419
reference and so can you comment on

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:43,480
those metrics no I don't have metrics

00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:46,570
but I get a sense for example the people

00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,799
asking questions on our IRC channel for

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:52,960
one of our projects has dramatically

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,990
declined and those are questions about

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,570
things that were in the documentation

00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,799
and were badly presented because they

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,870
were in the wrong place they were there

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,690
but they were in the wrong place and we

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,130
don't see that we see people asking much

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,309
more interesting and difficult questions

00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,660
about how to do new things instead of

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:13,240
about things that they should have found

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,919
in the documentation very easily so

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,570
that's the best I can offer there Thank

00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:22,630
You Dean and thank you very much

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,630
you

00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,620
