SQLAlchemy ([http://www.sqlalchemy.org](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)) and Postgres ([https://www.postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/)) provide several useful tools that allow us to build and query records through time: _temporal models_. Combining a need to have robust auditing, as well feature development on per-property history, we can turn “regulatory overhead” into an exciting technical challenge. At Clover Health we have built a small library to automate the task of decorating a model and making it “temporal.” This talk aims to demonstrate the underlying data model and interface for building this system.
