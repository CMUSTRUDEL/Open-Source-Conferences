Title: Matthew Rocklin   Dask A Pythonic Distributed Data Science Framework   PyCon 2017
Publication date: 2017-05-20
Playlist: PyCon 2017
Description: 
	"Speaker: Matthew Rocklin

Dask is a general purpose parallel computing system capable of Celery-like task
scheduling, Spark-like big data computing, and Numpy/Pandas/Scikit-learn level
complex algorithms, written in Pure Python.  Dask has been adopted by the
PyData community as a Big Data solution.

This talk focuses on the distributed task scheduler that powers Dask when
running on a cluster.  We'll focus on how we built a Big Data computing system
using the Python networking stack (Tornado/AsyncIO) in service of its data     science stack (NumPy/Pandas/Scikit Learn).  Additionally we'll talk about the  challenges of effective task scheduling in a data science context (data        locality, resilience, load balancing) and how we manage this dynamically with  aggressive measurement and dynamic scheduling heuristics.
