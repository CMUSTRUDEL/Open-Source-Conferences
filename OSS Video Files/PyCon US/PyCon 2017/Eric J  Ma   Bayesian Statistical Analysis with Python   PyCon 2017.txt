	"Speaker: Eric J. Ma

You've got some data, and now you want to analyze it with Python. You're on your way to greatness! Now the problem comes: do I do the t-test? Chi-squared test? How do I decide? In this talk, inspired by many Pythonista Bayesians (@jakevdp, @allendowney, @twiecki, @fonnesbeck) before, I will show you how you can take common statistical decision problems, formulate them as a Bayesian analysis problem, and use PyMC3 as your workhorse tool for gaining insights. This talk will be math-light and code-heavy, and if you download the slides, you'll have a simple template for more complex Bayesian analysis down the road!
