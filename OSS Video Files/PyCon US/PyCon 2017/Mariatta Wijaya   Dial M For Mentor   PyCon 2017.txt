Title: Mariatta Wijaya   Dial M For Mentor   PyCon 2017
Publication date: 2017-05-20
Playlist: PyCon 2017
Description: 
	"Speaker: Mariatta Wijaya

One of the nicest things about Python community is the availability of mentors willing to help you. Various mentors have helped me navigate the open source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a mentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to reach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome, where one may feel like they donâ€™t deserve the help.
In this talk, I will provide advice about working with a mentor.
Asking for help is not a failure.

choosing to come here in the course of

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,969
completing your mission you will come

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,950
across some roadblocks it's it's not

00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,950
always going to be easy it's not always

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,310
going to be smooth sailing there will be

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:53,829
bumps there will be times when you get

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:57,490
stuck unable to continue when you see

00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,850
that roadblock what are you going to do

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,509
about it

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:05,049
what can you do you're going to start

00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:08,649
asking yourself just how much effort you

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:11,490
want to put into it just how badly do

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:14,830
you want to complete your mission and

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:18,100
depending on your answer there are two

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,980
options you can take there's one option

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:25,560
that's really really easy and takes very

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:31,600
little effort you could just give up and

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,150
I'm sorry just say no I'm done I don't

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,069
want to do this anymore

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:42,440
turn around go back to your comfort zone

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:46,410
move on do something else

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:50,730
take very little effort to give up an

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:56,160
even option always available to you at

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:58,320
any stage of your journey and it's easy

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,390
to come up with excuses to justify

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,180
giving up should be telling yourself at

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,060
least I tried it's okay to give up now

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,330
it's not going to work out maybe you

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,440
think that you're not meant to do this

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:23,100
it's not really worth doing time to move

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,880
on just thing about excuses they're

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,440
invalid

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,260
they are invalid bearer errors when you

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,830
make excuses you could be making a

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,870
mistake I I hope you don't choose to

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:45,780
give up not until you try this other

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,760
option you've gotta reach out find

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,959
someone who can help you and guide you

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,470
through it and it's going to take a lot

00:03:51,959 --> 00:04:00,420
of effort and time just to find the

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:02,610
right person because what if you're new

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,450
you don't know you're new to programming

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:10,020
or new to Python new to the community do

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,739
you even know who to reach out to can

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:19,440
you trust their advice or maybe you know

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:21,930
who you know you can trust them but

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,370
maybe they say no they got other

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:29,730
priorities can't help you there are a

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:34,140
lot of uncertainties when you have to

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:37,830
rely on someone else but this is what

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:42,590
you're going to have to do in order to

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:45,810
move forward and complete your goal and

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:51,630
you can come up with excuses for not

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:54,390
wanting to get help maybe you think your

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,009
questions are stupid you're gonna look

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,969
stupid

00:04:55,009 --> 00:05:01,969
for asking those questions we don't want

00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:05,149
to let the whole world know that you're

00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,319
stuck they're going to realize you're

00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:10,219
not that good

00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:17,029
so maybe just a stupid question is not

00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:19,849
worth asking right but there is no such

00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:22,849
thing as a stupid question there is no

00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:24,919
such thing you can't figure out how to

00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:27,169
set up local environment that's not

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,960
stupid you don't know what a decorator

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:37,550
is that's not stupid don't know how to

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:41,270
do git rebase not stupid these are valid

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:48,009
questions there are others who has the

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:51,289
same questions what will there are

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:55,580
people out there who want to make you

00:05:51,289 --> 00:06:00,620
feel stupid there are negatives members

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:04,759
of the community drawers men's planners

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:10,550
they exist they're toxic and when you

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:15,229
you're getting mocked you can throat cut

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:19,309
a disengage and leave find a different

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:23,330
community the mentor you're looking for

00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:28,899
knows better than to hang around in the

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:32,719
community that tolerates them it is hard

00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:35,529
finding a mentor that will not judge you

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:38,930
you never know who it is going to be

00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,360
they're almost invisible and welcome a

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,740
guy they just don't always walk around

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,360
wearing message saying I'm a mentor it's

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,469
not in their business card it's not in

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,990
their job title how can you reach out to

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:58,159
them if you don't know who they are

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,860
you're gonna have to find the right

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:02,839
community first and it's going to take a

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,620
lot of effort only you'll know which

00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,720
community is right for you you might

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,570
have to try several different commune

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,460
before you find the right one one where

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:22,610
you can feel safe asking those questions

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:24,800
without feeling to be judged not able to

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:30,290
find a memory is not the only excuse for

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:35,240
not wanting to get help maybe you think

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:37,430
that only newbies should get help but if

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,560
you don't consider you yourself a newbie

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,600
anymore

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,080
maybe you start thinking that shouldn't

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,040
I know all of this by now I should be

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:55,970
able to help myself I don't need help

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:59,390
right not true it's still okay to ask

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:04,750
for help even when you're no longer a

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:07,790
newbie nobody's really perfect nobody

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,650
really knows everything everybody needs

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,040
help

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,110
what's more likely to happen is that

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,710
you've become an expert in certain

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,560
domain maybe you want to pick up new

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,840
skills learning about a new library

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,810
you've never heard of or you want to

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,260
transition from one row to another from

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:34,520
programmer to designer to manager you're

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:37,700
gonna be a newbie all over again you

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,140
will need help reach out when you need

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,700
to maybe you don't want to reach out

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,970
because you think it's going to be a

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:53,120
waste of people's time you're just going

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:57,500
to be a burden mentoring you is not a

00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,950
waste of time mentoring you is a

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:05,570
valuable and rewarding experience to

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:07,790
your mentor they learn from you you may

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:14,330
be exposing them to new problems that

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:17,300
they not normally face truth is mentors

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:21,410
face their own problems they have their

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,140
own challenging days they face their own

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,420
uncertainties

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:29,980
so when you come to them with a problem

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,030
in their area of their expertise

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,410
something they actually know how to

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:38,750
solve something they have the answer for

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:44,540
it's nice for them they'll be happy to

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:46,850
help you reach out maybe you simply

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,600
think that you don't deserve any help

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,060
maybe you're a newcomer you don't really

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,720
know anyone you don't feel like you

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,720
belong here why should anybody help you

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:09,500
if you have that thought stop you belong

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,110
even if you're new to this you belong

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:17,060
you're one of us

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:21,320
you deserve to be home imposter syndrome

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,740
is real it can affect anyone men and

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,630
women

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:32,120
I think first up is you gotta realize

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:36,590
this can affect you but made it to get

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:42,470
help talk to someone about this you're

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:44,600
not alone all you don't want to reach

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,690
out because you're you don't feel like a

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,610
failure when you're at a point when you

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,430
need help

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:56,720
feels like the end it's like you failed

00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:03,260
at achieving something I know how that

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:06,880
feels but that's not true asking for

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:11,420
help is not a failure is not the end

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:16,100
when you reach out you'll be one step

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:19,850
closer to completing your goal it's the

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,210
beginning of a new success story you're

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:30,580
a success story your mentor success

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:30,580
story asking for help is not a failure

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:38,880
these are the myths that stand in the

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:43,110
way of your success they delay and

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:49,320
prevent you from reaching out don't

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:53,940
believe in them reach out find a mentor

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,250
to help you and you have to be the one

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,970
initiating this you have to be the one

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,160
who go out there and tell them what is

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,900
what it is you're trying to accomplish

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:11,100
and if you're in the right community

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:14,400
someone will answer so which community

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,320
and I know what this talk is called it's

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,060
called IOM per mentor but you can

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,230
actually dial em on your phone and hope

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,990
to be connected to the matter that

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:28,170
doesn't work you know pilotis is the one

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,890
community where as always still safe

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:35,370
that's my safe space Global mentorship

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:39,720
network helping women to become active

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:42,120
members of Python community I hope there

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,570
is one where you live and if there is

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:50,550
not start one start one or join us on

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:52,950
slack I also have great experience with

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,230
local Python useful groups I've been to

00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:59,250
the one in Vancouver and Seattle both

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:02,010
are awesome if you don't yet know the

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,680
community you have to go there you have

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:08,120
to get to know them somehow so local

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,340
Python user groups are a great place and

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,060
again if there's not one in where you

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,010
live and you've been wishing for one

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,630
start one you'll be helping the

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:25,650
community you'll be helping those around

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:30,060
you and I'm maintenance of open source

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:32,790
projects their mentors - whether they

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:37,680
like it or not whether they acknowledge

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:41,970
it or not one of their roles is to

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,820
mentor onboard newcomers new

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,780
contributors

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,100
they're not service providers

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,510
implementing the frequency one for free

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:57,140
they're not tech support people

00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:02,010
debugging your problems fixing your bugs

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,840
nope they're your mentors if you want to

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,330
get stubborn contributing to open source

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,300
if you wanna if you need help with the

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:14,480
library they wrote they're the one who

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:19,620
can help you luckily for us in python

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,500
there is no shortage of them even in

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,080
this room there are a number of them

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,830
here you might be sitting next to them

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:33,150
and not even knowing it be sure to say

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,640
hi and now if you're interested to come

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:39,120
contribute to see Python there are

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,250
mentors there is a Python mentorship go

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,380
to the Python mental comm there is a

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,810
link to core mentorship mailing list

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,090
sign up that's where you can ask

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:54,210
questions about how to contribute to C

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:57,990
Python but it's important to know that

00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:03,230
finding a mentor is just the beginning

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:07,410
of a new journey realize that you're not

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:10,560
gonna reach your goal just because you

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:14,900
have a mentor there are still a lot of

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,900
work you need to do on your own

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:23,580
mentorships takes time to build it's a

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:27,690
new relationship teamwork it's going to

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:33,300
require commitment and effort from both

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:35,790
you and your mentor if the respect they

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,060
deserve I've said that it's not a waste

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,300
of time helping you but you should still

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,650
respect their time it's not always going

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,020
to work out if you don't think it's

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,400
working for whatever reason you don't

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,660
agree you don't think that's been

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:54,440
available enough it's fine say thanks

00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:00,490
and go find another mentor

00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,490
do this all over again but don't give up

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,129
realize that they do have personal life

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,620
other commitments while we mentoring

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:14,750
others don't be too entitled you can't

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,180
always expect them to always be

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,959
available 24/7 you can't always expect

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:24,290
an immediate answer you can expect

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:29,449
immediate success there are a lot of

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:33,350
work you need to do on your own it's

00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:37,879
it's your own story your own journey

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:41,769
it's your own mission that you're trying

00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:45,160
to accomplish not your mentors your

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:49,100
mentors are there just to support you

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:53,810
they'll help you guide you into the

00:16:49,100 --> 00:17:00,310
right direction but they're just a

00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:03,439
passenger you're the driver all along

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:08,270
it's still your responsibility to follow

00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:11,720
through to accomplish your mission you

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:14,720
get to decide which advice you want to

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,500
take you get to decide how fast or slow

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,860
you want to go about this you're the one

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,860
in control of your own success story

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:32,030
gotta take credit for your own work

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,470
don't let anyone tell you you're

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:40,120
successful because you're lucky or

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:44,600
because you got help that's not true

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:48,830
when you successful it's because you

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:54,200
yourself put a lot more effort into this

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:57,789
than your mentor not luck not just

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,789
because you got help

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,540
but I know you still want to thank your

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:08,590
mentor all the mentors have worked with

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:12,680
never asked for anything in return

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:17,000
just happy to help but I know what they

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:26,750
really want out of this they want you to

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:29,870
pay it forward mentor others so Who am I

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:34,910
I didn't really introduce myself earlier

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:37,640
so I think it's my chance my name is

00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,370
Mara and I live in Vancouver Canada I

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,620
work as a software engineer and I also

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,770
help organize thank you for a pie ladies

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,590
and we meet once a month we alternate

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,300
between top med and code Jam and

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:55,820
everyone everyone is always welcome and

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:59,320
I'm also trying to take my made up

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:05,000
organizing skill to the next level by

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:07,760
actually organizing a conference so PI

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,710
Cascades is a new regional Python

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
conference in the Pacific Northwest and

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,980
the first one is coming to thank Google

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:20,800
in January and you're all invited and

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:26,020
I'm somehow I somehow I have three times

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,130
so I contribute to Python and I'm a

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:32,540
newbie at this it's something I just

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:36,400
added last summer I made my first tour

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,960
request to python.org in August and I

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:45,170
got the first batch accepted to see

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:48,550
Python in September but last summer was

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:51,620
not when my journey really start it

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,280
starts a year before that so two years

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,570
ago

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,760
I become interested in contributing and

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,860
I thought it was going to be easy I mean

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,120
I I know how to write Python code

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:08,140
I know source control I should be able

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,140
to contribute to open source

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:17,530
so I I spent like 30 minutes

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:21,940
reading the Deaf guide try to compile

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,770
Python from starters got some really

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,790
strange error message the kind I've

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:34,900
never seen before in my life had no idea

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:36,760
what to do about it so I did what I

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:43,260
thought the only option I have at the

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:46,440
time I give up and how easy it was I

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,670
believe if I couldn't figure it out

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,950
maybe I shouldn't be contributing to

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,290
Python I I don't I didn't want to be the

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,980
one who broke Python so maybe I

00:20:53,290 --> 00:21:00,310
shouldn't do that I really believe I

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:04,740
wasn't meant to do it I'm just gonna

00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,740
have lots of stupid questions

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:19,210
it took me a whole year before I was

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:25,720
ready to admit my mistake before I found

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:28,330
any motivation to try again and that

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,890
time around I knew I needed help I knew

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,400
I wasn't going to be able to do this on

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,490
my own

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:41,260
I needed to first overcome the myths

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:44,080
that were holding me back and then I

00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,930
started reaching out and even then I was

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:51,220
I was new really I don't know who to

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:57,210
reach out to I reach out to the only

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,210
name I knew guido van rossum

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:07,659
he's been my mentor for the last year

00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:09,549
and I'm through the community I also get

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:12,970
to meet with another Senior Corps

00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:15,250
developer right Raymond headington I met

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:19,090
him at a Pike on Canada last year and it

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:23,320
was due to the generous financial aid

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,470
program from Pike on Canada so when I

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:31,289
met Raymond

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:39,129
he offered to personally mentor coach

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:43,929
motivate cheer anything I need yes so I

00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:50,470
could continue contributing to cpython

00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:55,440
I don't think I could do any of this if

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,440
I did not reach out in the first place

00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:07,149
in fact there was a time when I wanted

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:10,710
to give up the second time but knowing

00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:14,220
that they will both have my back is what

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,220
clearly kept me going

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:23,950
you know Python is 20 years old more

00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:29,409
than that it's been an open-source

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:34,559
project from the very beginning everyone

00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:34,559
has always been welcome to contribute

00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:45,250
yet for the first 20 years all of the

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:53,799
core developers those with commit

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:56,889
privilege to Python happy men somehow in

00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:03,360
this community that's supposed to be

00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:03,360
open there is a barrier there

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:14,240
it really wasn't until four months ago

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,100
that for the first time ever yes there's

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:26,370
a woman

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:29,309
[Applause]

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,770
there is a woman who became a Python

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:36,059
code available and herbed that commit

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:40,429
privilege and now red cannon get the

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,429
honor of documenting it in a deaf guide

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,350
I'm just gonna try to introduce myself

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:57,059
one last time here so I'm my name is

00:24:52,350 --> 00:25:03,520
Mara and I'm as of 4 months ago I'm a

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:27,040
Python code available it means

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:27,040
[Applause]

00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:33,289
thank you

00:25:39,559 --> 00:26:04,739
thank you all right thank you I will

00:25:52,799 --> 00:26:07,080
take the first question from a woman as

00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:09,179
someone who mentors a lot of other women

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,049
what are some of the most effective

00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:15,919
things that you have seen from your

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:18,539
mentors that helped you be successful

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:23,399
one of the thing that really works

00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:26,220
with me is that just every couple weeks

00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:29,039
touch base you know check with your

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,659
mentee sometimes your mentee doesn't

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,519
maybe they don't want to reach out to

00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:36,299
you but I think as a mentor you have

00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:39,720
that you have that power you you get to

00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:44,929
motivate them and just check with them

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,929
once in a while thank you

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:55,179
what can the Python community do to help

00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:57,489
increase this ability on you as a role

00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:04,600
model and inspire more women to do what

00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:07,169
you have done I think one thing that the

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,350
community has really helped me is those

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:13,539
support financial aids for for me to be

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,940
able to travel because I really wouldn't

00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:18,249
be able to do that being able to travel

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,309
and speak here with support of the

00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:23,169
community that are financial aid

00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:26,470
specifically for members of

00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:28,149
underrepresented group those have been

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,480
really helpful and I hope there are more

00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,480
of that

00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:36,879
so can ask like a practicality question

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,200
of like so you say go to like meet ups

00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:40,149
and stuff but do you just like go

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,590
introduce yourself and be like do you

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:44,289
want to be my mentor like what's the

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:47,950
practicality of that like you seem to

00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:54,789
tweet like what's the actual like stuff

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:56,950
that you take oh yeah you've got to ask

00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:59,470
them somehow like first you gotta

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,960
identify someone who you think can help

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,009
you and reach out to them and hopefully

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,139
they will hopefully they'll provide a

00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:09,999
private conversation just between you

00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:14,259
that it doesn't have to be happening in

00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:16,710
public IRC channels you gotta reach out

00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,710
somehow

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,970
how do you deal with and overcome

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:36,130
impostor syndrome I've started seeing a

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,890
mental health professional last year to

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:43,140
help deal with it and I recommend it if

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:47,650
you can I know it's not free but I hope

00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,480
people will try to find a counselor will

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,280
find support group

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,280
you're really not alone in it

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,460
if there are no more questions let's

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:24,450
