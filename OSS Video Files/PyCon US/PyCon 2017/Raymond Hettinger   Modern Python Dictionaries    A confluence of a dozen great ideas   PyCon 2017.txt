Python's dictionaries are stunningly good.  Over the years,
many great ideas have combined together to produce the
modern implementation in Python 3.6.

This fun talk uses pictures and little bits of pure python
code to explain all of the key ideas and how they evolved
over time.

Includes newer features such as key-sharing, compaction, and versioning.
