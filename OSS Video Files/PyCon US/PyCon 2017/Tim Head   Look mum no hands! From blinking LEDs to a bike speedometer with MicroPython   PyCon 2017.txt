Title: Tim Head   Look mum no hands! From blinking LEDs to a bike speedometer with MicroPython   PyCon 2017
Publication date: 2017-05-21
Playlist: PyCon 2017
Description: 
	"Speaker: Tim Head

In this talk I will show you how to use a micro-controller to build a wifi enabled speedometer for your bike, using MicroPython. And some hardware. And a bike (maybe). I will introduce you to the world of MicroPython: a python distribution that runs on micro-controllers. Micro-controllers are small computers that are all around us: in cars, TVs, and your internet connected fridge. We will start with making LEDs blink, then serve webpages, build an interrupt handler and finally put it all together to make a wifi enabled speedometer for a bike.
