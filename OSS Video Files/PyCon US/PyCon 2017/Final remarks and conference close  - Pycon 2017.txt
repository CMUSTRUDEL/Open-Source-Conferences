[Applause]

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:17,100
and then suddenly the foresight of his

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:21,769
kindred came to him and he said but low

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:29,640
master Elrond the time of your abiding

00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:34,579
runs short at last we have come to the

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:39,210
end it seems so long when it started and

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:41,579
finally PyCon 2017 yet another one of

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,520
these wonderful conferences is very

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,980
nearly in the bag I have a few final

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,780
reminders to give you and then your

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,460
PyCon will be complete if you are

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,500
sprinting then you have several more

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,809
days of hanging out with a fraction of

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,649
the people here working together for the

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,449
first time or as a veteran of some

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,240
open-source project that you'll get

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,619
together a documentation project that

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,710
you'll be helping out with over the next

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,990
few days if you're staying for the

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,409
Sprint's then when we close here in a

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,320
minute or two there'll be ten minutes

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,939
for everyone to mill around and leave

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,970
the room if they're not involved in the

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,420
sprint dispersed into the city people

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,040
who are doing sprints stay here and all

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,140
of the sprint leaders will be

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
coordinated by coup shil das leading

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,630
that effort in order to get them to

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,990
describe their projects to you and help

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,759
you get coordinated on helping to start

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,259
the process of choosing a project and

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,090
knowing where to go in the morning and

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:50,340
also there'll be other sprint events

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,820
this evening that cushaw will tell you

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,250
about when he starts up if you

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,990
registered for the closing dinner we

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,840
would love for more of you to show up

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,149
this year it is at the Portland Art

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,030
Museum at 6:30 p.m. check your

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,789
registration if you paid us money come

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,370
eat the food it's over on the other side

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,910
of the bridge Google Maps should get you

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,510
there

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,090
and look forward to seeing you there

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,970
there's an information on the website if

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,770
you need the address and then finally I

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,350
believe you can show up a little earlier

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,350
but 9:00 a.m. is when coffee is served

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,940
each day to kick off each spread day so

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,010
you can at least show up that earlier

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,670
and again cushaw will have more

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,250
information I spoke to our hard-working

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,650
registration people and learned the

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,020
total count for this year of people who

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,270
had main conference registrations or

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,760
were present of the main conference in

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:54,740
2015 we had more than 2,900 people in

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:58,530
Montreal the first year here 2016 we had

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:02,810
3,200 people and I'm happy to announce

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:15,390
that this year was yet again a record 30

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:16,709
391 of you having taught a number of

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,959
people Python before in different

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,590
industries and businesses I'm acutely

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,320
aware that most Python programmers never

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,420
come to a conference their interests or

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,940
family situation or professional

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,190
situation never lead to that we're such

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,440
a tiny fraction of the people trying to

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,810
solve the world's problems with this

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,820
language but I'm very happy that this

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,280
many of us were able to show up

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,920
encourage one another and learn over

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,989
this weekend I had an announcement from

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,100
the PI ladies auction last year it was

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,440
around 16 thousand dollars I think the

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,050
economy might be coming back we were

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,340
very generous this year or you just

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,110
really wanted the objects this year you

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,900
helped raise a total of twenty one

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,940
thousand two hundred and seventy five

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,370
dollars

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,370
[Applause]

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,710
PyCon 2018 if after doing this to

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,750
yourself you decide you want to do it

00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,540
again

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:36,630
may 9th through 17th put it on your

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:38,880
calendars in Cleveland Ohio this time it

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,400
has been in Chicago before but this is

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,040
the first time the eastern side of the

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,370
Midwest will get to host but we always

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,560
amortize the cost of a new city and the

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,920
hotel contracts and everything over two

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,660
years which is easier on our organizers

00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,620
and also financially more advantageous

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,920
so also 2019 May 1st through May 9th

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:06,060
we'll be in Cleveland Ohio if you plan

00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:09,000
ahead that farm but what are you going

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,250
to do next many people both first-time

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,290
attendees and longtime attendees that I

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,770
talked to don't want to go an entire

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,900
year between being at a conference

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,880
learning more teaching more and being

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,090
part of this bigger bigger community

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,370
look for meetups in your area regional

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,400
conferences national conferences in the

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,090
country that you live in special

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,670
interest activities CyHi conferences PI

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,970
data conferences geo Python plone

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,790
conferences django girls events and all

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,340
of the other really great meetups and

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,260
get-togethers and events that you can

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,310
find that you can contribute to and

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:53,520
learn from at the same time for people

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,430
who live here on this continent or just

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,050
like visiting some of the ones in this

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,660
area that I've been asked about and been

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,960
recommending to people PI Ohio in late

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,470
July PI Gotham in New York in early

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,940
October PyCon Canada is actually now it

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,880
looks like they're going to pull

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:15,000
together two conferences in Canada this

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,700
year PyCon Canada itself will be moving

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,700
from Toronto and will be in Montreal

00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:24,959
and I'm already on the mailing list I

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,209
don't know if I'll make it but I did get

00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,769
on the mailing list for PI cascades

00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:36,869
which I believe will be happening in

00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:38,879
Vancouver and I've heard many great

00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:41,249
things though I've never yet personally

00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,099
gotten to attend PI Tennessee which

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,989
tends to be each year in early February

00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:48,269
whether you live on this continent or

00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,579
another one whether it's easy for you to

00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:52,739
travel a long way or not I hope you'll

00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,169
find really really interesting ways to

00:06:52,739 --> 00:07:00,809
connect with this community over the

00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:03,689
coming year and as usual the very last

00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:08,779
thing we will do is to thank our

00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,779
volunteers who worked

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:27,310
who worked long hours leading up to the

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,830
conference depending on their role long

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,599
hours at the conference some of whom I

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:36,970
have spoken to who did not see a single

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:40,840
talk and every one of whom paid like you

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:44,889
did to attend and support the PSF in

this effort all of your speakers by the

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,330
way also paid to come to the conference

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,820
like you did because it's a community

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,009
