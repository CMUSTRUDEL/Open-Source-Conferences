[Applause]

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,860
all right I think I'm up hi everybody

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,000
it's great to be here my name is Jake

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,670
van applause so as I was thinking about

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,039
this talk I was reflecting on the other

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,619
PI cons I've been to this is my sixth

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,310
one in a row and thinking back five

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,699
years and 2012 I was a kind of scruffy

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,130
starving PhD student and I came to came

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,890
to PyCon on a on a scholarship a travel

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,320
scholarship from the PSF and it was my

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,360
first experience with with a big

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,020
conference like this and I was just

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,700
blown away by the quality of the talk by

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,059
the people I met you know I'd been using

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,370
PyCon or using Python for years and I

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,039
got to shake the hands of the people who

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,570
wrote the libraries like numpy and Syfy

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,770
and ipython and all these things that

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,300
I've been using in my work and I was I

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,879
was just blown away by this conference

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,890
and I have to say I never imagined that

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,110
I'd have the chance to stand up here and

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,479
address you and it's really really

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,700
really a privilege for me so I want to

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,530
thank thank the PSF for giving me a

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,240
chance five years ago and I want to

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,729
thank Brandon and the organizers for

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,900
giving me a chance today to share what

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,960
I've it is to say with you

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,729
so thinking about about PyCon one of the

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,770
one of the things that comes to mind for

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,430
me and my experience here is that PyCon

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,350
is kind of a mosaic in some ways you

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,900
know if you go to a conference like the

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,810
SyFy conference or Django Khan or PI

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,430
data or anaconda Khan or Jupiter Khan or

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,869
all these other ones you you get a

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,240
specific slice of the Python community

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,970
but at PyCon you get everybody and it's

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,729
interesting everybody has each little

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,920
slice of our Python community has their

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,310
own way of using the language their own

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,899
sets of tools that they like to use and

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,439
their own approach to solving problems

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,210
and this came to light for me a couple

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,349
years ago I found myself during one of

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,700
the PyCon Emile's sitting with someone

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,210
who was pretty well known in the Python

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,810
community and

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,120
I you might know me that I'm pretty I'm

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,220
a fan of the Jupiter notebook in the

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,840
ipython notebook and and those types of

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,030
tools and I was sitting at that table

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,850
and this person across the way said oh

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,070
yeah you know ipython it's bloated and

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,100
it encourages bad software practices and

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,410
I was thinking you know my first

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,830
response was to get a little bit

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,270
defensive and I did the thing that you

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,010
know it's true true to my family

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,070
upbringing and I changed the subject and

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,080
avoided confrontation but thinking about

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,990
thinking about that later I realized

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,690
that this this wasn't a moment of attack

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,120
or defensive 'no sam moment that

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,460
reflects the fact that that person uses

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,370
python for different things than i use

00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,320
Python for and jupiter makes sense for

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,410
me but might not make sense for him and

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,710
I think that as we go through this

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,660
weekend it's it's a really nice way to

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,250
it's a it's a good opportunity to talk

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,840
to other people who use this language

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,520
differently than you do

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,330
so I want you to keep in mind this

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,000
Python mosaic as we move forward so Who

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,010
am I I'm Jake vvp if you can find me on

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,890
most of the internet under that handle

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,910
and the most important thing about me

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:33,190
right now is this little this little one

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,590
right here so four weeks ago today my

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,510
wife and I got a call that we'd been

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,400
waiting for for a long time but

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,950
nevertheless kind of struck us out of

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,690
the blue that this this little gal was

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,710
born that morning and needed a family to

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,730
take care of her and so I've been I've

00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,410
been since my job is a little more

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,470
flexible I've at home on paternity leave

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,140
for the last four weeks like furiously

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,240
writing PyCon slides between bottles and

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,490
and poopy diapers which has been just

00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,620
great so huge thanks to my wife for

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,180
taking a vacation day-to-day to be home

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,620
with the kids so that I could be here

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,540
it's awesome yeah in the Python world

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,760
you might know me I write this blog

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,340
sometimes I've contributed a lot of code

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,290
to scifi socket learn Astro PI and some

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,200
of these types of packages and I also

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,600
have a couple books that I've written

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,190
that you can check out if you want to

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,590
and one of the huge reasons that I'm

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,500
able to do all that work is that I have

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,990
an employer who is an amazing and helps

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,030
me actually supports me in writing code

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,520
every day and developing these kinds of

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,530
libraries the University of Washington

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,510
East Science Institute it's a it's a fun

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,900
place to work I'm able to spend my days

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,430
on research on coding on helping

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,590
researchers around the university to

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,560
more effectively use their data and use

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,880
it computational resources and a big

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,040
reason that I'm able to do that I have

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,930
to throw a shout out here to the Moore

00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,430
Foundation the sloan Foundation and the

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,350
Washington Research Foundation because

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,510
they support pretty much all the work

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,240
that I do and any of my open source

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,910
contributions you can kind of you can

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,590
think that they're behind it so anyway

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,660
that another thing about me is I'm an

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:18,150
astronomer and I'm coming to this talk

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,130
from the perspective of an astronomer so

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,100
what I want to do a little bit today is

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,130
tell you about how I as an astronomer

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,660
and as a scientist use Python it might

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,430
be a little bit different from how you

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,860
use Python and the tools that you use

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,630
but I want to give some perspective on

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:41,790
on what it is that that drew scientists

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:43,140
to Python in such big numbers so when I

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,990
say that I'm an astronomer a lot of

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,140
people have this kind of image in mind

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,380
this is this is Edwin Hubble at the

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,580
Schmidt telescope back in the 1940s you

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,800
might know Hubble because he has a

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,120
famous telescope named after him he was

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,490
one of the people who discovered the

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,060
expanding universe back in the early

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:06,600
20th century and this is kind of a nice

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,580
romantic view of astronomy right an aged

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,990
astronomer with a pipe in his mouth

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,900
looking through an eyepiece

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,350
but in my 10 years as a professional

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,810
astronomer I honestly I think I have

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,450
never looked through a telescope to be

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,070
honest the way that professional

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,590
astronomers look at the world is through

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,720
database queries of course right because

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,170
we have all these phenomenal instruments

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,000
out there that are are measuring data at

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,130
huge rates and I want to highlight two

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
of these that have been really really

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,820
big in the lab

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
20 to 25 years one is the Hubble Space

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,360
Telescope which you've probably heard of

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,340
and another is the Sloan Digital Sky

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,470
Survey which I think probably fewer

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,600
people have heard of the Hubble Space

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,810
Telescope is this instrument that's been

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,400
flying up orbiting the earth since 1990

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,990
and just taking phenomenal pictures of

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,220
the universe and this is one of my

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,040
favorites right here this is known as

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,200
the Ultra Deep Field and what this is is

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,060
the Hubble looked at a small little

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,460
slice of sky the field of view is about

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,090
1/10 the diameter of the full moon and

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:15,000
in that small slice of sky integrated

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,919
for hours and hours and hours to capture

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,290
enough photons to create this image and

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,210
every single blob you see there in that

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,300
image with the exception of maybe two or

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,880
three is a distant galaxy it's a

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,130
collection of billions of stars but

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,340
sitting out there in the universe up to

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,350
13 or more billion light years away so

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,140
these are some of these blobs that you

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,690
see in these pictures right now in this

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,580
picture right now are galaxies that are

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,260
from from the very beginning of the

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,080
universe and we can gather that light

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,360
and we can learn about where where our

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,669
star came from where our galaxy camp

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,100
came from and what kind of the overall

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,080
dynamics of the universe is so this is

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,120
Hubble has been phenomenal for teaching

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,979
us about those kinds of things for

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,540
learning about the early universe and

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:05,070
about things in very fine detail a

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,290
complimentary type of approach is what's

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,830
what's done by the Sloan Digital Sky

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,479
Survey and what I'm showing here is the

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,169
galaxies catalogs in the Sloan Digital

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,850
Sky Survey slow the Sloan survey rather

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,600
than looking at just a single little

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,460
point on the sky like Hubble scanned the

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,830
entire sky over the course of a decade

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,110
and was able to do spectroscopic

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,540
measurements of each of the objects out

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,719
there and so in this plot right here

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,849
what you see are the locations the

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,030
three-dimensional locations of galaxies

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,770
in our universe are we're right at the

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,080
origin right at the center and looking

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,880
out in those arcs is the piece of the

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,250
sky that the Sloan was able to look at

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,510
and what scientists have been what

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,649
astronomers have been able to do with

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,079
this is to look at this

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,939
see you know the galaxies are not spread

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,930
out uniformly there are all these clumps

00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:59,249
and clusters and filaments and voids and

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,029
encoded in that information about the

00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:03,930
spatial distribution of the galaxies is

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:05,819
information about the universe as a

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,980
whole how much matter there is how much

00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:11,249
dark energy there is how much dark

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,790
matter there is and so we're able to do

00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:18,149
that through this this really huge data

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,589
set that comes from the Sloan survey now

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,569
these are kind of those are kind of old

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:26,939
older telescopes those were launched in

00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:28,740
the 90s and the modern modern science in

00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:30,660
the last few years has been driven by

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,029
some other telescopes what I want to

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,290
highlight is this Kepler project and

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,610
you've probably heard about the Kepler

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,889
project because there have been a lots

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,559
of press releases lately with images

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,779
like this right this is the Trappist one

00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,459
exoplanet system it was not actually

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,559
discovered by Kepler discovered by the

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,189
Trappist telescope but what's special

00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,920
about this is this is a small star a few

00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:56,009
light-years away that's that has seven

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,629
small rocky planets around it and we've

00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,519
been able with the with these telescopes

00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:02,009
we've been able to discover these other

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,920
planets orbiting around other stars and

00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,290
start to think about you know what might

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,120
those planets look like the reason these

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,949
are so special is because a few of these

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,079
are in what's called the habitable zone

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:15,660
and astronomers define the habitable

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,879
zone as the region in space where liquid

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,550
water can exist because we don't have

00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,220
any other good definition of how life

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,370
can be so we think you know water is a

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,050
water is a good thing to look for but

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,779
pictures like this these artist

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,449
impressions kind of are misleading the

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,819
actual data that you get on a planet

00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:38,249
like this or on a system like this looks

00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:40,399
like that that that's what we've

00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:43,019
observed with Kepler this is the k2

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,120
observation of the Trappist system and

00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,679
let me describe what you're what you're

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,100
seeing here what you're seeing is these

00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:52,079
it's a single star that is kind of

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,809
wandering around between pixels because

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,639
the one of the one of the stabilizers

00:10:54,809 --> 00:11:01,499
broke on Kepler so it's sort of wobbles

00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,440
as time goes on and the the signal the

00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:06,050
planets that you're looking for there

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,900
are you see those as they eclipse the

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,910
star so the star has this brightness and

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,470
the planet goes in front of it and as

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,000
the planet goes in front it makes the

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,270
the brightness of the star dipped a

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
little bit and that dip of a sub percent

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,850
level is what we're looking for to find

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,660
the planets in in this data and that's

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,000
really hard because you have

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,640
instrumental noise it's a faint star you

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,740
have the star itself varies it has star

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
spots on it as solar flares and all this

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,570
stuff so the way that you can actually

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,160
pull out these planets is through this

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:40,040
incredibly intricate statistical

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,930
modeling of the system and the physical

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,660
parameters of planets as they go around

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,350
and what we know about how that does so

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,870
so finding these sorts of systems comes

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,780
down to writing statistical code and

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,300
really intricate data processing

00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,220
pipeline and I hope you won't be

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,010
surprised if I tell you that what Kepler

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:08,060
is using for that is Python code that's

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:09,800
on github right so if you if you want to

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,170
see some of the code that's being used

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,750
for for these data reductions you can

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,640
actually go and see see this an open

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,930
source and this is something as I'll

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,660
talk about later this is something

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,400
that's come from the scientific

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,250
community embracing the norms of the

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,570
Python community so another telescope I

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,130
want to tell you about this is the James

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,470
Webb Space Telescope this is not

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:34,090
actually the telescope it's a scale

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:36,530
model so this is the telescope that's

00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,110
billed is the replacement to Hubble

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,750
Hubble has been up there 27 years it's

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,370
had it's had a long run but it's going

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,250
to wear out soon and we need something

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,320
else to replace it and James Webb is

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,170
going to go up in space and it has this

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,810
huge mirror the Hubble mirror is about

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,460
the size of a person the James Webb

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,040
mirror is about three times that

00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,270
diameter and the other thing that's

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,400
different about the James Webb telescope

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,040
is once it's up there it's not going to

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,200
be as sensitive to visible light you

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,530
know the red green and blue that our

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,589
eyes can see it's more tuned to infrared

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,839
light so the the light that's just a few

00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,580
wavelengths longer than a little bit

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,180
longer wavelengths than the red light we

00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,430
can see

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,620
and one of the reasons that's important

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,360
is because in the infrared and with the

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,660
the kind of precision that James Webb

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,760
will have we might be able to actually

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,890
image those exoplanets that are going

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,630
around other stars so rather than just

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,310
seeing their shadows go in front of the

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,620
star we might actually be able to see

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,210
some of those planets themselves and one

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,250
of the most exciting prospects is

00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,800
looking at the types of spectroscopic

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,650
measurements that James Webb is going to

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,380
be able to do its spectra is when you

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,880
you break light into its component

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,730
wavelengths and kind of look at the

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,280
wavelength flux distribution and what

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,170
you can see what we'll be able to see is

00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,170
as these planets go in front of the star

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,600
we'll be able to isolate the the light

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,430
or our fine find the component of the

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,830
light that is passed through the

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,200
atmosphere of that planet look for

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,040
molecular absorption in that light and

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,410
then infer the molecular content of the

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,790
atmosphere and this is super exciting

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,800
this is kind of a holy grail in

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,660
exoplanet science we're actually going

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,270
to be able to know what these planets

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,640
are made of and there's some things that

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:28,550
it's a long shot but if you if you look

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,040
at the types of gases that exist in

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,930
atmospheres and planets out in the out

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,110
in the universe there are certain things

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,050
that never show up like oxygen and ozone

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:42,350
and those oxygen and ozone are things

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,050
that have no known geophysical source

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,240
they only come from biology they only

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,340
come from basically bacteria and plants

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,650
and living things so there's a small

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,780
possibility that in the next five or 10

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,120
years we'll be able to sniff out the

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,010
chemical composition of a planet around

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,350
another star and if we see something

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,970
like an ozone layer it will be a really

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,680
good indication that there's some sort

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,260
of at least bacterial life on that

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,690
planet and I find that to be incredibly

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,540
exciting right I think exploring the

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,180
universe in this in this way is huge and

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,880
again if you want to know how we're

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,020
processing that data JWST and actually

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,840
the whole Space Telescope Science

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,570
Institute has moved to using Python and

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,030
and Jupiter notebooks to to present

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,670
their material so it's pretty incredible

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,170
and and and the last project I want to

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,740
tell you about briefly is this one

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,810
that's

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,270
really going to change every part of

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,540
astronomy over the next 10 years this is

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,010
something that my PhD advisor has been

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,750
intimately involved with from the

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,580
beginning so as a grad student I was

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,620
able to work on a lot of aspects of this

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,930
it's a large synoptic survey telescope

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,880
so I don't know if you can see but

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,160
there's a image of a little person

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,990
standing there right so that's about the

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,220
size of the telescope this is this is

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,190
going to be a large ground-based

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,720
telescope it's not flying up in space

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,820
here's a picture of the mirror blank a

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,770
few years back before they started

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:10,459
polishing it was the LSP team and what

00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:13,130
with a mirror this big you need a really

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:15,350
large camera right so LSST is

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,320
constructing the largest digital camera

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:22,190
ever created it's a 3 Giga pixel camera

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:26,029
that has a has a CCD about the size of a

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,970
person right and just to give you an

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,760
idea of its field of view we have an

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,880
image of the moon there on superimposed

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,670
on the CCD chips and and this is just

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,190
absolutely mind-boggling mind-bogglingly

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,160
huge right 3 Giga pixels if you imagine

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,920
an HDTV right that's something like

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,089
2,000 by 1,000 pixels if you wanted to

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,800
display a single LSST snapshot in full

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:55,820
resolution you would need a bank of

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,790
1,500 HD TVs right so it's it's a lot of

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:02,690
pixels and the amazing thing is that

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:06,380
this these 1500 HD TVs worth of pixels

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,500
are going to be taken twice every 30

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,709
seconds for 10 years

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,809
right so the the the upshot of LSST is

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:18,230
it's basically going to be a decade long

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:19,819
video of the entire night sky it's going

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,189
to take about three days to cover the

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,750
whole southern sky visible from from

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,120
Chile where the telescope is going to be

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,760
located with a final catalogue of

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,410
hundreds of petabytes of data and I'm

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,750
not exaggerating when I say this is

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,210
going to absolutely change the way

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,950
astronomy is done in every part of

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,710
astronomy everything from the people

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,450
studying the dust in the Milky are the

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,670
dust in the solar system all the way out

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,530
to the most distant galaxies

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,450
and the structure of the universe itself

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,310
and I was going to go through some of

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,500
these science cases but really there's a

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,520
600 page book that talks about

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,330
everything that we're going to be able

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,670
to do with LSST and if you're interested

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,460
I'd suggest at least reading the table

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,990
of contents because it's pretty it's

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,330
pretty phenomenal the kinds of things

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,770
that we're going to do and you're

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,690
probably sensing a pattern now if you

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,450
want to know the software that's driving

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,880
this 100 petabytes of data it's on

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:17,510
github and it's in Python with parts of

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,700
it and C++ so this has been a real

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,430
revolution in astronomy over the course

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,280
of the last 10 years and I was curious

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,970
about this so I went and used a friend

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,440
script to to mine the astrophysics for

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,260
physical data system which is the

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,780
listing of all peer-reviewed papers in

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,020
the astronomy world and these are the

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,360
mentions of certain software languages

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,630
over the course of the last what is a 17

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,950
years you can see that Python is just we

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,500
have this hockey stick thing right

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:52,040
Python is having exponential growth in

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,770
the field of astronomy and some of these

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,100
older tools like like IDL which was most

00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:00,020
popular about the time that I started my

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,640
PhD is sort of tapering off a little bit

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,400
and that's that's good news because IDL

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,790
is a closed source system that has

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,030
licensing fees and doesn't really have

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:13,520
you know it students who learn IDL can't

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,950
go out and get other jobs they only get

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,200
astronomy jobs right so there's a lot of

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,270
really nice things about Python and for

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,030
the rest of the talk I want to I want to

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:29,150
focus on this why Python right if you if

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:31,160
you went back to 1985 and asked guido if

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,260
he thought that his little language

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,410
would be used to manage hundreds of

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,320
petabytes of data for a global system of

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:43,490
astronomers he'd probably say some Dutch

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,260
word for you're crazy and and if you

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,510
look back you know what python was

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,030
developed for back in the 80s it was

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,070
developed as a teaching language kind of

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:56,570
to bridge the gap between the shell and

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,660
C and he even said it was never intended

00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,460
to be the primary leg

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,320
which for programmers so if any of you

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,020
consider yourself a programmer in here

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,230
you're using the wrong language right

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,240
and you know if you go further in that

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,980
interview it's really interesting he

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,340
said I thought we'd write programs ten

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,980
lines fifty maybe 500 lines but here we

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,940
are using using thousands or millions of

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,370
lines of Python to to store and analyze

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,350
some of the largest data sets in the

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,480
world and I think that's incredible so

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,170
why is it that Python is such an

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,420
effective tool in science I think the

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,570
first thing that comes up is that it's

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,640
the interoperability with other language

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,790
languages that really drove this if you

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,350
go back long ways back and you you look

00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,730
at some of the great scientists one of

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,040
them was Isaac Newton and he has this

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,960
famous line where he said if I've seen

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,330
further it's by standing on the

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,310
shoulders of giants basically saying

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,440
that his science doesn't exist in a

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,270
vacuum he needed all the science that

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,980
came before him and I think if Isaac

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,130
Newton were alive today he'd say

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,590
something like this it's by importing

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,960
from the code of giants right

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,940
so whenever scientists are doing

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,680
something today they're using some sort

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,380
of computation that's the nature of the

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,270
data that we're working with and if you

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,220
have to reinvent the wheel every time

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,780
you do something every time you extend

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,940
the study you're never going to get

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,710
anything done so we're constantly using

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:27,240
the code of the people who came before

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:30,480
us if you want to get a glimpse into

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,430
kind of the first steps of Python and

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,470
science Dave Beasley wrote this

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,080
interesting paper in 2000 you probably

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,150
know Dave if you've been around you've

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,830
been around PyCon you probably know him

00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,500
as a person who teaches you to do

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,510
diabolical things with co-routines or

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,130
whatever right but back in the day 20

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,540
years ago he was working in a National

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,240
Lab and he was pushing some of those

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,670
scientists some of the first scientists

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,070
to use Python in the scientific fields

00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,510
and he said scientists work with a wide

00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,670
variety of systems ranging from

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,100
simulation codes data analysis packages

00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,860
databases visualization tools homegrown

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,690
software each of which presents the user

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,270
with a different set of interfaces and

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:11,170
file formats as a result the scientists

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,420
may spend considerable amount of time

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,940
and to get all these components to work

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,100
together in some manner and so he in

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,560
2000 was advocating Python as the

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,480
solution to that kind of glue together

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,360
all these tools and if you look at some

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,460
of the other know patriarchs of the of

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,560
scientific Python world like John Hunter

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,110
he was the creator of Matt Matt plot lid

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,910
and he said I had a hodgepodge of work

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,240
processes I'd have Perl scripts that

00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,250
called C++ I'd load them into Matt Matt

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,750
lab and plot them and then I started

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,180
using new plot and this is what inspired

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,930
him to work on matplotlib is sort of a

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,730
Python replacement for that whole

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:51,580
mismatched pipe pipeline that he used a

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,500
similar Fernando Perez he started the

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,750
ipython project which has grown into

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,240
Jupiter and he had a similar thing my

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,420
advisor had a heavily customized oxide

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,880
bash workflow to manage job submissions

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,470
post-processing of C codes he so used

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,070
her scripts and on top of that added a

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:12,280
layer of Perl gnuplot IDL in Mathematica

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:15,430
so this sounds absolutely horrible to me

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,710
right and this is what inspired him to

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,360
create ipython as a way to use Python to

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,570
wrap all these together so really

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,910
fundamentally in science Python is glue

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,620
more than anything else it started out

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,170
as a way to glue together all these

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,570
hodgepodge of scientific tools that

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,460
people were working with and that the

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:37,630
high-level Python syntax wraps these

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,550
low-level C and Fortran libraries so

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,170
another reason that Python has become

00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,180
such an effective tool is this whole

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:47,110
notion of batteries included right

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,580
Python can out-of-the-box can do so so

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,720
many things if you compare it to

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,130
something like C or C++ out-of-the-box

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,530
Python has this built in standard

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,340
library that can do everything from you

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,330
know launch a web server to read JSON to

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,790
working with the file system to

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,520
manipulating strings and that's that

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,740
sort of thing is incredibly valuable and

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,690
for the for the libraries that aren't

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,100
built-in there's been this ecosystem of

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,750
software built around Python that has

00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,790
has turned out to be really useful and

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,200
so if you look at the genesis of

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,640
scientific Python there were a number of

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,230
people that worked on it but one of the

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,370
one of the faces of this is Travis

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,590
olifant he

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,990
started the numpy project and parts of

00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,640
the sci-fi project and he was saying

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,620
when I discovered Python I really liked

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,930
the language but it was very nascent and

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,520
lacked a lot of libraries and I felt

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,740
like I could add value to the world by

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,530
connecting these low level libraries to

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:45,059
high level usage in Python so this is

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:48,040
moving from Python as glue to Python as

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,500
applications that kind of glue together

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,720
these underlying tools and the

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,970
scientific ecosystem has really really

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,770
ballooned and exploded over the last few

00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,630
years you have Python on the ground and

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,330
then you have these various packages

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:04,090
that that work with Python and extend it

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,130
in ways that are useful to scientists of

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,540
course numpy gives you array computing

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:13,300
ipython on jupiter give you kind of a

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:15,550
IDE on top of on top of Python you have

00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,980
the syphon project which lets you

00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,080
basically wrap C code and write C code

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,080
in Python which it's really interesting

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,840
actually aside my favorite language in

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,130
the world the program in is psyphon you

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,559
should you should try it sometime it's

00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,390
really fun if tools like numba and ask

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,640
that addressed scalability and

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,320
computation and built on top of this

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,020
layer you have some things that are

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,380
slightly more specialized tools like

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:44,080
bouquet matplotlib for plotting you have

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,940
pandas for data frames and x-ray for for

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,490
multi-dimensional labelled structures

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,830
and then of course SCI Pi which wraps

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,679
all the scientific routines like

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,570
integration and interpolation and a lot

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,600
of these depend on the layer below them

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,850
and of course scientists you know these

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,440
are higher level tools but there there's

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,030
an even higher level from there you know

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,670
people want to do machine learning so

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:10,570
scikit-learn was built that depends on

00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:12,400
Syfy and numpy simpie does this symbolic

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,220
manipulation similar to if you've used

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,080
Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha you can you

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,679
can solve equations symbolically in

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,830
Python Network X I could image PI MC for

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,350
Markov chain Monte Carlo stats models

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,000
and then this even more specialized than

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,980
that on top of that you have a lot of

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,980
different fields that have developed

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,320
these fields specific packages for

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,060
Python so we're really at the at the

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,710
point here within the Python community

00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,779
in the science community

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,539
be that if you have a problem you want

00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:45,130
to solve in Python someone has written a

00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:47,520
package for it you can go out there and

00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,840
it's most likely on github out there and

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,640
this has been this has been absolutely

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,049
huge in the scientific world and that's

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:59,080
why we're seeing that hockey stick

00:26:53,049 --> 00:27:02,020
growth in in astronomy so another reason

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,809
Python is so so effective for science is

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,600
just its simplicity and dynamic nature

00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:10,360
you know you've probably seen this xkcd

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,429
before if you type import antigravity

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,120
into a Python interpreter this will pop

00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:17,679
up and it gets set a thing that a lot of

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,330
people have noticed about Python Python

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,330
is just fun all right

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,070
if you if you go from using another

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,770
language and then start using Python

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,039
it's it's kind of a freeing thing you

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,559
you just you just write down what you

00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,929
want to happen and it happens for it

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,409
Python is kind of like executable pseudo

00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:40,690
code and it just works it's great and

00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:42,370
Perri greenfield he's a one of the

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,870
project leads at the Space Telescope

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,850
Science Institute these are the people

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,740
behind the Hubble Space Telescope and

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,840
James Webb Space Telescope

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,750
he gave an interesting talk at a PI data

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,700
conference a couple years ago about why

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,440
Python has been adopted in astronomy and

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,450
he's one of the people if you want to

00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,740
know why Python is in astronomy he's one

00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,240
of the people that's really been in the

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,100
background making it happen

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,980
getting it adopted by some of the large

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,960
organizations and what he said is Python

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,240
is a language that's very powerful for

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,159
developers but also accessible to

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,690
astronomers getting those two classes of

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,940
people using the same tools I think

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,520
provides a huge benefit that's not

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,940
always noticed or mentioned so really

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,100
the the key here is that Python is what

00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,779
the people writing the libraries are

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,000
using and it's also the tool that the

00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:32,470
people using the libraries are using and

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,990
that simplicity really makes it makes it

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,700
tick because astronomers are not

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,190
computer scientists a lot of us don't

00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,990
have CS training so we're used to

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,510
writing scripting languages and Python

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,159
fits that bill pretty well so for

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,130
day-to-day scientific exploration it's

00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,929
really the speed of development that is

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,509
primary and the speed of execution is

00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,999
secondary

00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,829
so you sometimes get people especially

00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:56,989
when you're working in a in an area with

00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:59,059
lots of data you get people a little bit

00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:00,829
incredulous that you're using Python to

00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:03,139
manage these terabytes or petabytes of

00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:04,489
data right and they start saying things

00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:07,399
like you know why don't why don't you

00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:08,869
you see it's so much faster right and my

00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,549
favorite answer is you know why don't

00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:13,190
you commute by airplane and sort of car

00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,809
it's so much faster right the nice thing

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,479
about Python is there's very little

00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:19,309
startup cost you don't have to go to the

00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:21,589
airport and go through TSA and pack your

00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,419
bags and squeeze into a little tube and

00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,399
then get to the wrong place of the city

00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:28,999
that you're going to you just hop you

00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:31,249
just hop in and start going right so um

00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:33,679
another piece of this this puzzle is

00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:37,159
that scientific coding is is really

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,499
really nonlinear and exploratory so this

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,999
is a clip from you know I'm I spent a

00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:43,069
lot of time with kids these days this is

00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,079
a clip from a from a kids book called

00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:47,149
ADA twist scientist you should really

00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:49,699
check it out if you have have little

00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:51,739
ones but it says in one place ADA Murray

00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:54,019
did what scientists do she asks a small

00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:55,879
question and then she asked two and each

00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:57,709
of those led her to three questions more

00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:00,469
and some of those questions resulted in

00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:02,479
four and this is really the process of

00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:04,879
science you know we're not software

00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:06,919
developers who have a road map and sit

00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:08,959
down and write a module and do

00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:12,319
test-driven development until the tests

00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:15,589
pass we have a data set and we start

00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:18,559
playing around with it and we maybe plot

00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:19,999
it one way maybe plotted another way I

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,069
don't know if my videos going to play

00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,899
because of the web web connectivity oh

00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:26,119
well this is a video the Jupiter

00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:28,579
notebook of me kind of doing some data

00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,699
exploration trying some things out going

00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:37,339
back to the beginning trying it again

00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:40,249
and the and and the thing is that that

00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:42,379
the way scientists use Python is really

00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:43,369
very much like that we're doing we're

00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:46,099
doing all sorts of kind of

00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:49,190
back-and-forth exploratory work very

00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:52,690
nonlinear and it means that a system

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:55,339
like jupiter notebook is actually ideal

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,409
it might not work for people who are

00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:59,329
kind of used to classic software

00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:01,879
development and looking for an IDE and

00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:02,700
it might feel a little bloated but for

00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:05,570
what we're doing

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,119
it's it's exactly what we need right

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:12,239
sorry about that video not working so

00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:16,109
the last piece of why I think Python is

00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:19,019
such an effective tool is because it has

00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:21,269
this open ethos you know I pointed a

00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,309
while ago to the fact that all these big

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:25,710
telescope projects now have github

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:28,200
repositories with their processing

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,989
pipeline in Python and other languages

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,970
open on there that was not the case um

00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:38,609
ten years ago and if you if you read a

00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,710
lot about in the media about science

00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:42,960
these days you'll see all these articles

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,460
about these replication crisis's right

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,649
you know everyone's talking about how

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,359
science was broken the replication

00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:50,539
crisis has begun we can't replicate

00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,529
studies by our peers like that the core

00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,359
foundations of science are sort of

00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:57,679
crumbling because we're not doing a good

00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:00,239
job of making our studies replicable and

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,879
the the people who are thinking deeply

00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:06,269
about how to solve this mainly what

00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:09,119
they're landing on is the idea of open

00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:11,220
science there's this great quote from

00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,669
Buckhead and Donahoe and a paper about

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,259
20 years ago an article about

00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:18,779
computational result is advertising not

00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:20,700
scholarship the actual scholarship is

00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:23,309
the full software environment the code

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,840
and data that produced the result so

00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,239
basically what people are saying is in

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,100
order for science to progress we need to

00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,899
start doing things the way the open

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,759
source world has been doing things for

00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:35,070
decades right we need to start putting

00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,049
our code out there on the web so anyone

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,669
can download it and run it we need to

00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:40,710
start licensing it in a way so that

00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:43,889
other people can use it and build on it

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,809
and this is starting to happen one of

00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:49,769
the one of the great examples of this is

00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:51,779
this incredible event that was detected

00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:53,850
last year by the LIGO the laser

00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:57,179
interferometer fer AMA tree

00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,070
gravitational observatory they managed

00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,769
to detect the ripples and space-time

00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:04,350
that were caused by two black holes

00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:05,850
spiraling in and merging together black

00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,580
holes are so massive that they actually

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,679
bend the fabric of space-time and as

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,499
they spiral in you get these spiral

00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,059
waves of gravity waves ripples in

00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:18,179
space-time is

00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:20,970
heading out and when LIGO released that

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,799
a result this is a result that I'm

00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,960
almost certain will get a Nobel Prize

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,590
sometime in the next few years when they

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,059
release that result they also released

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,220
you can see if you if you recognize

00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,660
matplotlib these are the the graphs that

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,640
they have and they made them in that

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,730
pileup they also released notebooks and

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,309
you can go from the raw data all the way

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:44,190
to this plot that they published just by

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:46,440
following their notebooks and so this

00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,570
really is the the way forward for

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,340
science out of this replication crisis

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,010
making sure that everything we publish

00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,980
is out there with the code and following

00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,179
what the open source world has done so

00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,370
this is something that I've tried to do

00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:02,520
in my own projects these are two books

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,410
that I mentioned and you can buy them

00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,500
from O'Reilly if you want to or you can

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,419
go on my github and you can look at the

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,040
whole book in the form of notebooks you

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,230
can download it and execute it and

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,720
confirm what the code runs the way I

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:18,540
said it runs so I've been trying to walk

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,730
the walk as far as this this openness in

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,010
my own work whether it's writing books

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,250
or writing my research papers and things

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,899
like that incidentally if you if you

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,820
want a copy of this book I'm going to be

00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:34,290
signing it tomorrow the Riley boys at

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,879
10:00 a.m. so come on by so the Python

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,190
world really in this in the sense of

00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,240
openness is really influencing science

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:44,250
you know the Astro PI library that I

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,280
mentioned previously this is something

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,740
that astronomers are rallying around and

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,540
there's so many papers these days that

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,149
are doing their analysis based on tools

00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,460
and Astro PI and and the way Astro PI is

00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:01,200
structured is modeled off the the Python

00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,020
the Python world the way that Python has

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,810
developed and I'm going back to Harry

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,760
Greenfield this is a adapted from a

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,560
slide that he gave at that same keynote

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,500
and where he was talking about what

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,020
Python has done for astronomy you know

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,970
traditionally astronomy has been that we

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,920
haven't really shared software been

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,440
possessive about it and Python it's

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,020
cooperative and it's all about sharing

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,880
then fragmented efforts in the past and

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,650
now it's more unified under this Astro

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,960
PI umbrella

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,660
rather than being plans top down by an

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,730
institution it's planned bottom up by

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,130
the people who are using and creating

00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,200
the software and rather than read the

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:44,820
rest I'll let you take a look at that

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,980
but the point is here that by having

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,650
scientists come into the world of Python

00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,990
into the world of Pike on a lot of you

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,600
folks do things differently than we do

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,390
as scientists but but we've been able to

00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,700
learn from you and really improve the

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,770
way science is done and I'm very hopeful

00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,720
that these things like this replication

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,450
crisis is going to be behind us soon

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,260
because we as scientists are adapting

00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:12,510
the tools of the open-source world so

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,860
why is python such an effective tool in

00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,480
science since these I think it's these

00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,400
four key things we have this

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,220
interoperability where it can it can

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,260
serve as glue for everything else that's

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,330
out there we have this batteries

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,370
included and third-party modules that

00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,470
have all been developed in order to make

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,290
Python as useful as possible and as few

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,930
keystrokes as possible the simplicity

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,700
and dynamic nature it allows an intro

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,550
astronomy student who's never coded

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,810
before to start writing scripts by the

00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,360
end of a week and writing applications

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,210
by the end of the semester right it's

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,340
really really phenomenal and this open

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:51,180
source ethos is is such a good fit to

00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:53,310
science and I think science and

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,290
astronomy in particular owes the Python

00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,710
world a big thank-you for kind of

00:36:55,290 --> 00:37:00,540
getting us on the right track so that I

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,850
want to bring back this this idea of the

00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,770
the mosaic so I gave you a little bit of

00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,840
a perspective of how Python is used in

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,760
science you know this is kind of one of

00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,670
those tiles in the mosaic and everyone

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,130
else out here has a different experience

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,160
you know you might you might be a person

00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:19,620
versus a condo person or you might be a

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,020
pycharm person versus a Jupiter person

00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,680
or you might be what else pie pie versus

00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,140
cpython

00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,520
and everyone depending on depending on

00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,230
what you're doing in your day to day

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,490
life you have a really different

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,710
approach and a different set of tools

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,420
that work for you and I'd encourage you

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,210
while you're here at PyCon this weekend

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,100
to keep that in mind you know the real

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,840
opportunity here is that you can

00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,150
interface with people who are using this

00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,650
language

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,980
ways that are completely different than

00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:48,440
you right so I want you to try to seek

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,440
out talks from people who are in other

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,200
fields and seek out conversations with

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,710
folks who are using Python in different

00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,020
ways and you know if you do you never

00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,390
know you might end up completely

00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,369
changing the way your field is done so

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,500
that's the end and thank you very much

00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,700
I'd love to take some questions

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,110
[Applause]

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,110
[Music]

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,650
it looks by my clock like we're

00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:26,260
unfortunately at time so if you have

00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,000
questions for dr. van der PLAs come up

00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,640
front or find him and one of the other

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,530
meeting rooms of the conference as we

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,900
head into our first break before our

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,940
first round of big talks let's give

00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,110
another hand to dr. van der PLoS thank

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:46,809
you for talking

00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:46,809
