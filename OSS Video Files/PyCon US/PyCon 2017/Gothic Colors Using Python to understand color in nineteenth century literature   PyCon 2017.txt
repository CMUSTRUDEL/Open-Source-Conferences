Publication date: 2017-05-21
Playlist: PyCon 2017
Description: 
	"Speakers: Eleanor Stribling, Caroline Winter

Do you love literature and programming? Have you ever been curious about what the heck “Digital Humanities” are? Join us for a quick survey of what’s going on in this growing field and learn about a specific project, “Gothic Colors” where we set out to enumerate and analyze color references and mood in 19th century Gothic novels, using Python and a couple of popular libraries.

hello everybody and thank you again for

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,529
coming to the final talk on the final

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,480
day of Pi con 2017 we're so glad you

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,810
made it this far it's going to be a very

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,640
interesting talk we've got Gothic colors

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,590
using Python to understand color and

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,869
19th century literature and we have

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,809
Eleanor Stribling and Carolyn Caroline

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,290
winter speaking for us may I please ask

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,210
you to quiet your electronics this is

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,890
the last talk of the day so anybody

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,010
caught snoring we're going no I'm just

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:52,620
kidding please welcome Eleanor and

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:53,730
Caroline good afternoon everyone thanks

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,980
for having us today

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,149
thanks for coming and we hope this will

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,969
be an interesting talk so this is an

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,980
example of a time where we use Python to

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,199
solve a problem outside of programming

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,549
outside of tech you know not for

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,549
building Twitter for cats or anything

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,409
like that but for a problem a question

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,930
that Caroline had is the digital

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,880
humanities scholar and about a year ago

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,380
she mentioned to me she studies the

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,580
Gothic period literature which we'll

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,070
talk about a little bit more the

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,890
terminology but basically literature

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,560
mostly European from about 1700 through

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,390
1914 the falls certain pathetic which

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,150
again we'll talk about later but she was

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,579
curious about color mentions in that

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,740
literature and so I spent an afternoon I

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,310
thought of every color word I could I

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,869
used Python to go through the text and

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,579
count the color words and gave her a

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,649
very preliminary readout if I think it

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,930
was Tess of the d'Urbervilles or

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,540
something like that so we did that but

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,130
then a few months later she still had

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,200
that question and so we thought we would

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,280
do something a bit more in-depth and

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,820
that's the project we're going to tell

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,350
you about today so first of all let's

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,630
introduce ourselves so my name is

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,340
Eleanor Stribling I live in San

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,579
Francisco California I've been in tech

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,099
since 2008 I've mostly been in client

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,720
success and product management roles but

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,979
being a product management got me really

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,110
interested in programming so I've also

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,730
been programming for about four years

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,140
and get to do it sometimes it work too

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,290
so I'm one of those people who does not

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,450
want to choose one thing over the other

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,900
and I love Python and I've been working

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,670
in Python for about three years now

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,560
hi everyone my name is Caroline and so

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm a PhD student at the University of

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,940
Victoria North in Victoria British

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,830
Columbia and I study British Romantic

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,930
literature so as elder was mentioning my

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,330
time period is kind of late 18th century

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,980
to early 19th so I study not look like

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,620
Frankenstein for example that's my time

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,270
period and I am what we call a digital

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,190
humanists which just means that I use

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,190
computers to do my humanities research

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,840
ok ok so first we're going to talk up a

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,130
little bit more about how our project

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,020
came about so I'm going to explain a

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,900
little bit more this problem that led to

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,280
us starting on this project so I'm going

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,530
to start by showing you this painting

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,330
it's a painting by Claude Lorrain and

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,500
it's called the enchanted castle when

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,970
showing up a little bit dark on the

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,050
slide but there's castle in the middle

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,030
and there's a figure in the foreground

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,110
and it's very kind of dark moody

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,060
painting this painting was really

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,920
inspirational to one of the most well

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,510
known writers of the Gothic period named

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,010
Ann Radcliffe and you may have heard of

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,280
her novel the mysteries of Udolpho

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,750
kind of an iconic gothic novel so we

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,830
know that she was really inspired by

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,510
paintings like this but the question I

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,970
had was whether or not we can see this

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,830
inspiration in her novels so the

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,570
question I brought to Eleanor was ok if

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,670
we know this is what the paintings look

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,620
like and she was inspired by them does

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,450
she use these color words in her novels

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,660
if we could visualize her novels would

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,880
they look like this painting and this

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,130
question led to a broader question what

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,870
is the color palette of the Gothic so

00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,130
you might think of gothic novels as you

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,959
know having come to cash holes and

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,900
damsels in distress and things like that

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,700
which is true and here I'm showing you

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,770
another painting this is by John Henry

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,480
fusilli it's called the nightmare and

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,970
you may have seen this before it's an

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,380
iconic gothic painting it was very

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,400
influential in the visual arts as well

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,080
as in literature and so we're wondering

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,090
ok so if this is an iconic gothic

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,430
painting does gothic as a whole actually

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,650
look like this so if we if we can

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,730
visualize gothic as you know these dark

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,990
colors this painting

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,290
again unfortunately you can't see that

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,360
one the slide but it's full of dark

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,100
shadows so the the background is all

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,260
shadowy and dark there's some really

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,900
dark red curtains kind of crimson II

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,600
colors there's some kind of monstrous

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,040
figures there and then in really strong

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,070
contrast to the figure in the foreground

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,140
who's a delight colored woman wearing a

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,510
white dress so what's important about

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,370
this painting it's partly this

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,990
coloration so the contrast between this

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,140
kind of dark shadowy world and this

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,670
light colored figure in the foreground

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,680
so again our kind of broader question

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,750
was like okay so this is an icon of

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,580
Gothic visual arts again does this

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,440
palette translate to the literature of

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,690
the time too so does this kind of

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,320
accurately reflect the color palette of

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,760
Gothic literature as a whole so just

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,220
take a slight detour and talk a bit more

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,840
about the digital humanities so our

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,060
project belongs to a field of study

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,590
called the digital humanities basically

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,510
because we're using computers to do

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,730
humanities research in this case we're

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,250
studying we're doing literary studies

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,730
but still humanities involves things

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,980
like history art history anything in the

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,690
in the realm of humanities it's a

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,610
relatively new field of scholarly study

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,140
which is really exciting for humanists

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,790
like me because it provides us with new

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,660
ways of doing our research so new tools

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,160
new methodologies and new theory as well

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,490
so here I'm showing just some examples

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,960
of different types of gauge projects we

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,310
do things like digitizing medieval

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,050
manuscripts so we can have a digital

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,250
archive of these rare and fragile

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:02,070
materials on the top left there it's

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,630
showing a network visualization of

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,880
relationships between authors in the

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,210
modernist period and on the bottom there

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,580
it's showing we can sit to analyze texts

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,290
using statistics to see what genre

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,510
things belong to there lots of different

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,570
ways you can you can apply digital tools

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,490
to the humanities and what's exciting

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,470
about this too is that not only do we

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,660
use computers to do humanities research

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,150
but we also study the digital as a

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,800
product of humans of something we make

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:34,350
and do as well okay so the purpose of

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,180
our humanities RDH project as we said

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,540
was to discover the color palette of

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,529
19th century British literature so we

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,179
know that literary

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,069
scholars we studied Radcliffe's

00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:46,019
landscape description so we've done kind

00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,609
of literary analysis about them but

00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,149
nobody's actually explored her use of

00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:52,799
color specifically or in fact the color

00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,899
of 19th century gothic fiction in a

00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:56,369
broader sense so we found that nobody

00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,019
has answered these questions that I came

00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:01,079
to Eleanor with partly because no one

00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,099
has even asked them before so I'm going

00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,919
to talk a little bit about the

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,999
methodology that we used so the first

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,039
thing we needed some kind of raw

00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,749
materials for this analysis so the first

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,399
thing we needed was period color words

00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,839
so like I mentioned the original version

00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,849
of this product it was project it was

00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,619
just me thinking about color words that

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,939
I knew and I figured like damask was in

00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:20,549
there something like something that's an

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:23,159
old-timey so but we actually went to the

00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:24,749
oxford english dictionary and we got a

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,579
list of color words that were

00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:29,039
categorized by family but also by year

00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,769
so we were able to take out things from

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,449
post 1914 for example which do not fit

00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,579
into the gothic period so we didn't get

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,349
sort of false positives on that and we

00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,759
also we retained the older stuff just

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,469
because in the literature it tends to

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,119
tends to throw back a little bit in

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,009
terms of language it uses some sort of

00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:45,589
more arcane language so it was

00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:48,389
appropriate to leave the older words in

00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:50,069
and then representative text so Caroline

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:53,429
did a ton of work putting together a

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:57,119
pretty dynamite corpus for us of we

00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:59,189
analyzed in this one 124 texts most of

00:07:57,119 --> 00:08:02,279
which came from Project Gutenberg and

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,719
then what we did what the Python was we

00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,699
wanted to analyze this corpus and sort

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,199
of see where the to match where we could

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,869
find color words in the Gothic

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,579
literature so we would find the named

00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:13,529
colors we determine the type of word

00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,029
which we'll talk about in a moment at

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,739
the frequency in the order because we

00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,389
wanted to see sort of the evolution of

00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:21,149
color through the text and see if there

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,499
any patterns and of course visualized

00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:25,049
results but the other thing we wanted to

00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:26,699
put it all online so that was another

00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,869
requirement to the project so it wasn't

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,979
just like churning through all the data

00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:32,459
we wanted to actually put something on

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,529
the internet so I wanted to talk about

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,349
some of the problems that we encountered

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,579
because it was I think not not super

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,990
hard but there were definitely things

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:42,240
that we encountered that we didn't

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,249
really expect to the beginning this is

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,829
one of the problems we we managed hyssop

00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:52,500
aid early and it's a sore knee one haha

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,400
so checking if your way so it was about

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,870
four

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,390
example the word rose so English is a

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,090
very weird language and a rose can mean

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,190
this rose is a noun which if you need a

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,890
bouquet can you grab a refresher which I

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,750
clearly did is something that action

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,600
happens to so the subject of the

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,660
sentence the Rose is beautiful

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,150
he gave her a rose cetera so it's a noun

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,620
Rose is also a color so this is what was

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,930
seeing the most sort of germane to our

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,520
analysis right roses sort of pinkish

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,620
shade it could be any one of these so

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,140
that that seems to fit but unfortunately

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,970
words like rose and rose in particular

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,360
is interesting because it's also a verb

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,700
it's the past tense of a verb she she

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,560
rose to the occasion he rose to meet me

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,750
etc so we clearly just couldn't count

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,460
the words so that's where it became more

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,050
clear that we needed to use Python and

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,450
in particular the natural language

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,600
processing toolkit to categorize the

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,910
words and when we first started I said

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,180
Yoho this is great we will just look at

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,850
adjectives and leave it at that but as

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,980
the project evolved after I did the

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,930
first day to run we realized there was a

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,760
problem with that yeah we quickly

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,320
realized that when we're just using

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,860
adjectives we weren't actually capturing

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,150
all the words that were describing color

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,440
so the first example at the top of the

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,110
slide there it's passive from

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,850
Frankenstein and it's pink is clearly

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,090
using this example to describe the color

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,500
of the cheek but because the NLP K was

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,300
picking this up as a noun it wasn't

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,890
being included in our list of adjectives

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,760
even though it was one of the words we

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:26,160
wanted to study so we decided to capture

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,380
color words that were nouns that we're

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,910
still being used descriptively so the

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,700
second example here is from weathering

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,110
heights it's describing an orange now in

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,210
this case it's actually referring to the

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,300
fruit so I took an orange from my pocket

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,710
it's referring to the physical thing but

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,270
in orange is a really good example of

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,130
this but when things are so highly

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,600
associated with their color even when

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,580
we're referring to the noun it's still a

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,500
vocal mat color so you can't really

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,780
separate the idea of an orange from the

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,610
color represents so because of this we

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,610
thought okay we'll include nouns as well

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,600
it's actually enriching our dataset even

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,990
though we're actually looking for

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,580
descriptive words however this created a

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,800
new problem which we quickly realized

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,960
was that some of these nouns even though

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,520
their color works they're not being used

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,000
describe color so here are just a few

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,640
examples the first one is Isabella not

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,140
something we use a lot today but in the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Romantic period it was quite a common

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,700
color word referring to kind of a light

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,080
khaki color but in our text corpus it's

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,430
only ever used as a name

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,460
they don't actually use it to refer to

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,200
the color so we had to take it out

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,670
somewhere it was natural we still use

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,490
natural as a term for kind of off-white

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,610
color but in our corpus it was only ever

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,680
used as to contrast with unnatural so

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,510
it's used in a different sense same with

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,460
Imperial we know this as a color purple

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,040
but in our corpus they only ever use it

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,110
to talk about Imperial courts and angry

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,700
can refer to color of red but that's not

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,640
how it was being used in our text corpus

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,350
either so we had to go through and and

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,780
look for these words that weren't that

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,830
weren't being used the way we the way we

00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,510
want to display them they weren't

00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,520
actually being used to refer to color

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,900
and so that's really highlighted when

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,430
you're doing this type of analysis that

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,140
you need to be familiar with the text

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,700
corpus so even though it's kind of a

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,680
distant reading project you still need

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,180
to go back and check your results just

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,480
make sure you're capturing the words

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,550
they're actually being used yes so now

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,590
it's clearly not familiar with the text

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,990
corpus so that's what I'm talking about

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,820
the Python part of this so I wanted to

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,350
tell you more about what we did so as I

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,760
mentioned one of our goals we wanted to

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,960
visualize it and we also want to put

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,000
around the Internet

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,320
so we had to use a bunch of different

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,700
tools to make that happen I'm going to

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,340
explain a little bit more about you know

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,930
what we did so we used a natural

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,040
language processing toolkit we've

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,950
already mentioned that which is a great

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,640
Python library for text processing

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,880
recommended check it out if you have

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,120
known already we had a lot of data to go

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,210
through

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,920
so we had like I mentioned 124 texts

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,090
that included about nine point six

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,380
million words total and we had from the

00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:56,310
Oxford English Dictionary

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,650
we had one thousand one hundred and

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,270
forty two color words so there's quite a

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,250
lot to sort of sort through when you're

00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,380
doing this analysis so I wanted to

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,150
pre-process some of it before we put it

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,610
online but then there was another kind

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,780
of issue which was that we also needed

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,250
to think about how we were going to

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,590
display this as I mentioned we wanted to

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,690
visualize it so what I did was the

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,400
Oxford English Dictionary categorizes

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,840
every single word into a color grouping

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
so what I did was I took the color

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,220
grouping

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,710
I looked at the table that you can see

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,690
there of web colors and I related them

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,190
to one another so you know something in

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,860
the deep red and crimson family would

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,360
get the crimson web color etc admittedly

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,530
it is a little subjective but I think I

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,780
got pretty close

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,930
well take feedback on that but anyway

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,210
and then what we did was put this data

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,000
about the colors and the relationship

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,510
like the name of the color the year that

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,270
was first used with and the hex value we

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,760
put that into Postgres and then we also

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,380
put data from the text into Postgres as

00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,020
well which I'm going to explain to you a

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,030
little bit right now so like I mentioned

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,710
we start at Project Gutenberg NL CK

00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,330
stuff in Postgres so what did we

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,880
actually do in that middle step within

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,950
ltk so the first thing I did was

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,020
tokenize the text and that included

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,560
removing punctuation putting everything

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,400
lowercase etc so and that's basically if

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,570
you're not familiar it's basically

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,980
splitting the text and then I used NL CK

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,450
like we mentioned earlier to categorize

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,210
it so if it was an adjective or a noun

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,650
it sort of made it to the next stage and

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,480
here's some of the code that I use to

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,790
figure out if it was an adjective or a

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,310
noun so this point you know I'm going

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,100
through the whole text you know as it as

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,820
it existed in a sort of original form

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,030
and then if it was an adjective or a

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,700
noun

00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:43,490
I used NL CK dilemma ties it so limit

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,870
ization is basically a really in-depth

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,720
form of stemming so stemming is

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,190
basically if you've got white and wider

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
it will recognize that wider as a form

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,660
of white and say okay that's the same

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,920
word same root word I found that in when

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,770
we were going through this list even

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,420
though the word color list from OD the

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,000
Oxford English Dictionary was massive

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,420
like over 1,100 words we were still

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,890
missing things when we use the stemmer

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,050
that were they were sort of getting past

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,370
that filter and weren't being converted

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,750
correctly and I think one of those

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,970
learnings I had was that you know

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,650
language from this era was a little bit

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,930
fluid and they did some funky things

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,089
with words that I was not expecting to

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,160
the limit excuse me the limit Iser even

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,870
though it's a more expensive process was

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,600
a lot better at getting the words and

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,760
really finding the root words so that I

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,709
can compare them to the color list so if

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,030
they were on our color list so this is

00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,270
again the the Oxford English Dictionary

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,510
list

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,460
I would put them into a list that held

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,900
both the original color word and the

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,020
type of word it was the weather was an

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,180
adjective or a noun and I did that

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,970
little amount of data because because

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,590
these texts are so long otherwise I I'm

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,160
using Django's web frameworks but is

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,840
online I was I was I was going past

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,090
character limit for the JSON field so

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,580
that was kind of a problem so that's why

00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:02,370
that was what I stored in one part of

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,630
our record and then I made another

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,070
record for word dictionary so I

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,200
basically just take every single color

00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,460
word in its original form and sum the

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,530
number of times that we saw it and

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,760
you'll see in a moment what I did with

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,350
that when we actually put it online and

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,590
then if it wasn't image severe now and

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,630
of course I tossed it and then so from

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,070
Postgres we had all this data from the

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,510
text like I mentioned in the dictionary

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:29,100
the list we also had all the color data

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,570
so using that data for outpost graphs in

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,200
the web app that you'll see in a moment

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,700
what went to the browser was data about

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,410
basically how those those two connected

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,100
like where the color words matched with

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,140
a web color and what we generated was

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,210
what we call a color profile so it's

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,160
basically each one of those little boxes

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,920
represents an instance of a color word

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,210
being mentioned and you know colored of

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,800
course with the web color that we

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,870
identified to go with it

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,150
then the dictionary is displayed like

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,740
this so it's literally just the the

00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,360
color word that occurred and the number

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,150
of times it happens so just to give kind

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,320
of user a different view of the use of

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,350
color sort of what the most popular

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:10,400
words are really and then finally a

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,930
radial charge that could summarize data

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,890
by a lot of different ways we cut a lot

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,810
of different ways you'll see some of

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,400
them the presentation on the website we

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:22,440
do it by author but we also looked at it

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,480
by by period as well so one of the first

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,030
findings we had was that there was a

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,770
very wide variation between the text

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,900
which is not necessarily something that

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,520
you're expecting so here you can see the

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,770
two color profiles for two different

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,560
novels the Picture of Dorian Gray and

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,970
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein so you can

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,040
see and these are about the same length

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,270
approximately the same length so you can

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,760
see in the picture of dorian gray

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,710
there's there's a much wider variety of

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,220
colors being used as the palette being

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,740
used as

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,420
richer than in Frankenstein you can also

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,800
see that there's there's a different

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,620
look and feel to the two different

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,790
palettes so Dorian Gray it has just wide

00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,240
a variety of color it's a little bit

00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,920
brighter

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,720
whereas Frankenstein is actually very

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,620
green which was again not something we

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,990
were necessarily expecting we can also

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,110
use this data to compare the colors and

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,750
different literary periods so this graph

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,460
is showing all the color words in our

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,520
romantic texts and again that's kind of

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,440
late 18th century early 19th and if you

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,690
can see it's dominated by black kind of

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,850
watery blues and greens and white with a

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,900
little bit of red and some other colors

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,850
as well and we can compare this to the

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,450
victorian gothic so this is kind of

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,040
later part of the the 19th century so

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,780
you can see it's actually flipped the

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,180
Victorian Gothic is dominated by white

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,460
and black and then a little bit of those

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,080
watery greens and reds as well so this

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,670
was actually surprising again that we

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
could see this it's pretty clear

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,040
difference between these two literary

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,990
periods we can also compare how

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,730
different authors use color so this

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,750
slide is comparing at Radcliffe who I

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,030
talked about before

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,180
Matthew Gregory Lewis who wrote the monk

00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,310
an infamous novel from the late 18th

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,900
century and also on Nathaniel Hawthorne

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,070
and so you can see again there's a

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,520
really clear difference in the way

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,140
authors are using color in their novels

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,640
Radcliffe has a lot of black but also a

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,490
lot of natural colors so again those

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,260
greens and blues Matthew Lewis uses a

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,940
lot of whites and reds which actually

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,680
makes sense because his novels are a lot

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,050
kind of bloodier and sexier than

00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,930
Radcliffe and Nathaniel Hawthorne is

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,640
extremely dominated by black and

00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,350
compared to the others however this is

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,080
because one of the stories in our corpus

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,370
is all about a black veil so again it's

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,840
really important to go back to the

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,150
corpus when you're analyzing these

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,280
results and you know make sure that

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,870
you're making a fair comparison it's not

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
really fair to compare the state of one

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,120
of the stories is about a black veil of

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,930
course it's going to have more

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,030
references to black another thing we can

00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,670
do with this data is look for somatic

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,080
patterns so this one I really liked we

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,510
looked at vampire tales through the

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,180
century so we started with Christabel

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,970
from 1798 and ended with Dracula from

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,750
1897 and this actually really surprised

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,909
me because

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,710
if you can see that the vampire tales

00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:07,500
from the Romantic period so the ones in

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,909
the top row not only do they use fewer

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,120
colors overall but they don't actually

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,950
use a lot of red and a few instances of

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,750
red that they do refer to are talking

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,720
about flames or wine they're not

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,280
referring to blood by the time you get

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,440
to the Victorian period there's a lot

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,750
more reds we can see and they are

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,179
starting to refer to blood so by the

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,770
time we reach Dracula 1897 that kind of

00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:31,230
modern vampire mythology has been

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,049
established show I'm sure you recall so

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,640
Dracula he drinks blood from his victims

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:37,440
neck so that's a mythology that was

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,820
established later in the century and

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,679
that's I think why we don't see all

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,850
these references to blood earlier on so

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,500
let's go back to our original question

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,559
so this is a question that started at

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,940
all how similar is Radcliffe's palette

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,799
to udall foes the novel that she wrote

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,049
sorry how similar is Lorraine's palette

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,390
the painter to the mysteries of Udolpho

00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,010
so here we're comparing the two

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,260
side-by-side there's the painting again

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,110
by Lorraine and there's the color

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,520
palette from Radcliffe novels so first

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,720
glance they actually don't seem similar

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,720
at all which is a little bit

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,190
disappointing but if we look a bit

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,380
closer we'll see that actually he's also

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,630
is dominated by green there's a lot of

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,090
green in Udall so and so in that sense

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,679
it does actually seem quite similar to

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,390
Lorraine so that kind of tonal green

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,610
quality even though she uses a much

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:27,390
broader palette which again was not

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,679
something I was expecting to see and we

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,169
can go back to my second question as

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,360
well so if this is an iconic gothic

00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:35,700
painting how well does this reflect our

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,340
findings about how colors used in Gothic

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,140
literature and actually this does pretty

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,169
accurately represent what we found so

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,539
there are a lot of blacks and dark reds

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:48,360
and yellows things like that as well as

00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,860
a lot of white and that's what we saw as

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,559
I showed you in the romantic and the

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,179
Victorian periods one thing that this

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,220
painting doesn't reflect those that use

00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,049
of blues and greens those natural colors

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,630
that are absent from this painting but

00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,400
are very prominent in the literature and

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,100
those are the colors of nature the ones

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,530
that Radcliffe is using you all say is a

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,440
total non literal literary scholar in

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,480
any way I can barely even say it I think

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,309
that one thing that came out is really

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,730
interesting for me it was just the

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:20,789
of references to nature and natural

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:23,429
versus unnatural supernatural versus

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,020
natural like that whole contrast is very

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:27,330
prevalent in the literature but also

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,470
obviously in the color another really

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,299
interesting thing I thought

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,860
Terron already made us but I thought it

00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,510
was really interesting was that a lot of

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,270
the words that they use our related to

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,610
textile in the 20th century a lot of

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,919
words we cut out of the of the Oxford

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,679
English Dictionary list were crude words

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,299
so in like the in the 20th century

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,730
people started using like avocado to

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,039
mean green and stuff like that but in

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,080
the 19th century a lot of the new color

00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,490
words were were related to textile so I

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,100
thought that was pretty interesting and

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,500
obviously there's a lot of textile stuff

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:03,179
going on in that one so that's my that's

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,409
my artistic critique offense so like I

00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,250
said earlier we wanted to put this on

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,020
the Internet

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,580
so it is on the internet it's got a

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,909
little bit of jank to it's still so

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:15,720
don't judge me but it is up there super

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:17,490
easy to remember URL so it is it is in

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,400
fact up there it's live if you want to

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,830
poke around that's cool it's got you can

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,169
search by author and you get you know

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,570
that beautiful radial you get to see the

00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,400
like the color profile and the

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,320
dictionary as well we also have one link

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,340
that shows you the entire palette so the

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,700
number of times in that 124 text corpus

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,770
that we encountered each word and that's

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,909
that's ordered by alphabetically so you

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,909
know if you're really a passionate

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:47,220
vermilion person you can go check it out

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,780
so the other thing we did was we put

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,659
this on github because as Caroline

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,669
mentioned we we hadn't encountered she

00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,440
had encountered anybody asking this

00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:57,330
question before and so I really wanted

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,280
to put it out there and see if anybody

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,470
else was interested if other people

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,870
wanted to use the code or improve on the

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,280
code so it is on github so if anybody is

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,870
interested in that kind of stuff or if

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,390
you've got a friend or relative who's

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,580
using in literary studies in any way and

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,900
the humanities more broadly be happy to

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,270
chat with them or if they want to chat

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,549
with us we would love to do you find any

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,750
issues you can put them on github too

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:21,120
and you can of course always chat with

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,149
us on Twitter I'm Eleanor strip this is

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,130
a trick Caroline Caroline yeah mystery

00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:27,630
Caroline and so

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,280
that's that's about it we did so before

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,930
we closed want to say thank you so much

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,840
app icon for kind of taking a chance on

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,880
this talk it's not a very typical talk

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,130
for Python Python but hopefully you

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,720
enjoyed it and also the pilot is for

00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,220
general awesomeness and welcoming and

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,990
finally to the social science and

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,270
Humanities Research Council Canada that

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,770
funds Caroline's research so that's it

00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:55,670
thank you so much for listening thank

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:58,110
you thank you

00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,970
excellent thank you very much we've got

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:06,420
about five minutes for questions if

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:08,220
anyone has questions for the latest I

00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,470
was wondering if you ever got the chance

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,750
to actually do a pixel analysis of the

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,680
of your images and actually do like a

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,180
comparison at like to image to you the

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,490
colors that you got from the novel and

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,620
like actually do some mathematical not

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,850
just visual analysis of that yeah we did

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,940
that a little bit and that's definitely

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,590
something we could do more of um yeah so

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,600
camera what's called we found we found a

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,850
kind of a website a demo website that

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,750
would do that for us but yeah that's

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,150
something we could definitely do in

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,560
future and compared to the okay pixels

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,000
yeah yeah I said one of the limitations

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,280
of the way that we did it like using the

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,680
web colors was that I think there it

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,140
gets doesn't get the nuance of stuff

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,460
very well like so you know we might see

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,110
the word blush or something like that

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,940
and where it's a very muted blush color

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,460
in the painting like we don't really way

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,690
of capturing that currently so I think

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,590
that it's one of the reasons that it did

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,210
look a little bit different but they're

00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,850
very similar themes of Caroline except

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,660
the green and the blues and all that

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:06,740
kind of stuff cool thank you that was

00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:10,920
absolutely absolutely fascinating and

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:14,520
did you find a way to deal with problems

00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:17,010
like the names of colors that vary

00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,810
across time like the word livid which I

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,720
saw was in one of your lists but has

00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,700
changed it seems to have covered several

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,460
different colors over time or even

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,640
colors names that have different

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,580
meanings between cultures maybe across

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,580
the Atlantic where the same name would

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,930
represent actually a different color yes

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,460
that was one of the problems we

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,190
encountered I know even blue and green

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,170
there's a Dickens who published protocol

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,550
called the blue book but to us it

00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,810
actually looks green it's a color we

00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,280
would call green now so that's one of

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,960
the problems is the way that it changes

00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,290
across time and we didn't actually find

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,270
a solution to that because it's it's

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,500
it's really hard to capture you know we

00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,390
don't like we don't know what Radcliffe

00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,400
meant by green so we kind of recapturing

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,930
the way we see it now but that's

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,550
definitely something we struggle this

00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:07,120
yeah thanks

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:11,560
so I was wondering if you used if you

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,420
ran your analysis on I would say the

00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,190
control data set so for example null

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,100
gothic novels but those are called

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,290
novels of the same period are novels

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,850
outside of the time period where which

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,700
is selecting whether you've seen the

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,380
difference do I think that yeah um

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,910
that's we were just talking about that

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,220
but we should try doing that and compare

00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,320
it to kind of non gothic also I mean

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,870
gothic is kind of a it's a loose term so

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,980
we're defining it quite broadly but it

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,840
would be really interesting to compare

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,150
it you know just novels and manners like

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,130
Jane Austen's novels and see how they

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,410
compare right with the color palette is

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,270
specific to gothic novels George's yeah

00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,840
it would be fascinating thank you very

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,220
much for this talk oh thank you a nice

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,990
was what I was wondering with her

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,490
problems with the NLT Kay dealing with

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,580
the differences in language from the

00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:00,400
19th and 18th century versus today's

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,220
modern language yeah I actually I tried

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,990
Spacey as well I did a little test and

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,330
because I heard it was really good and

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,890
easy to use and so I set that up and I

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,460
found it wasn't as good at catching the

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,810
words as NLT Kate was and I don't know

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,660
why that is I really liked it against

00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,250
that like if it's the way that that it

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,880
was it was created like it was trained

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:24,280
on on a broader set of text perhaps but

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,810
it had trouble sometimes classifying the

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,830
different types of words not so much

00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,720
identified the color words at the

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,860
classification thing was hard for it and

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
I think it's because of the different

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,190
ways that people use language then

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,580
mm-hmm yeah the syntax could be quite

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:40,600
different

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:42,730
yeah hi hi you noted you got a list of

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,300
color words from the OED along with

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,370
dates of usage and I'd just like some

00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,040
more detail about exactly how you got

00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:54,100
that list from ueb with dates of usage

00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,890
yes very non-technical so the OED I used

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,360
to the online version which has a

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,040
historical to Saurus and so it just

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,170
provides use kind of taxonomy of color

00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,210
words by family and then the individual

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,650
colors and so we thought about trying to

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,080
eclipse great but somehow but really I

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,450
just typed it out my psychosis words

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,010
into you know watching TV into an Excel

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,290
spreadsheet yeah I know that I'm all out

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,610
so I learned a lot of color words that

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,679
was actually fascinating

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,640
there I thought sure there's no problem

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,970
with oh you sorry

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,950
Python thank you very much for the talk

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,970
I was just wondering if you got two

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,190
questions Oh

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,710
firstly if you'd looked attribution of

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,480
the colors to particular things so the

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,660
landscapes get talked about differently

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,240
to people for example and also have you

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,309
looked at all into how the color

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,320
palettes that you found do they relate

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:50,860
in any way to how literary historians

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:52,660
now talk about those texts well I

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,130
haven't actually encountered a lot of

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,330
literary historians talking about color

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,570
in text at all that was something that

00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,470
was really surprising when we started so

00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,000
there you know there a couple of

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,760
articles from there but nothing that I

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,220
came across had really been done in a

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,299
this kind of sustained way and what we

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,500
had seen was kind of just your

00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:09,850
impressions of the novel like if you

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,309
read Frankenstein say was quite dark

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,500
like there's a lot of black but this

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,270
actually not counteract with that but

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,350
it's more kind of precise way of looking

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:23,530
at it yeah so I don't think there's much

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,179
else out there about this I see we've

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,650
got two more people in line for

00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:29,559
questions if we can do them quick we'll

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:33,250
get you both in I was just wondering if

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,070
you handled it anyway or started to deal

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,860
with like metaphorical use of colour or

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:42,309
use of this data to start studying the

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,380
semiotics of the literature at a deeper

00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:46,330
level or broader level yeah that was

00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,980
something wouldn't love to do I'm not

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,320
sure how to do that we did look at

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,049
pretty quick so we did look at colors

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,270
that were attributed so if they said you

00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:56,350
know that could peacock shirt or

00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,150
something like that where they're using

00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,390
kind of peacock as a metaphor for that

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,370
color blue but again it's really hard to

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,260
to match the hex colors that's a problem

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,900
we had and again you know snow it can

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,190
snow looks different and we can't it's

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,020
really hard to pin down what exactly

00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,400
snow looks like so it's definitely

00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,530
something I'd like to do more but I

00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,160
don't know how and maybe owner well I'm

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,929
not sure python is the answer yeah

00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,790
hi few years ago there was a discovery

00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:23,470
of largely relating to Renaissance

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,800
painters that the colors that that we

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:29,560
see were vastly changed from what was

00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,170
they're so like Titian became much more

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,450
colorful have you spoken to an art

00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,430
restorer to see if the paintings that we

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,950
see now when we look at paintings from

00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:41,500
from this period are in fact the colors

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,180
that that were what people saw when they

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,320
cook with them in that period oh yeah

00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,930
that's a great question now we haven't

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,010
done that um and I know again the slide

00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,660
is really dark the painting is not

00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,450
actually dark as it appears on the

00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,330
screen and you can Google in phases um

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,380
but but the style that at the painting

00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,000
we're looking at it's called a

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,490
picturesque so it's known for being very

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,670
dark and tonal so that's that's what

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,750
they were going for so I don't know

00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:09,970
that's a great question we'll have to do

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:13,680
that - thank you good ideas yeah thank

00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,680
you everybody and let's give them a big

00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:22,500
Eleanor and Caroline thank you very much

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:25,730
and thank you everybody for PyCon 2017
