Title: Sam Agnew   Hacking Classic Nintendo Games with Python   PyCon 2017
Publication date: 2017-05-21
Playlist: PyCon 2017
Description: 
	"Speaker: Sam Agnew

Do you feel like using your superpowers as a developer to bring the games of your childhood into the future with the power of the Internet? In this live coded journey, we'll build an SMS powered ""Game Genie"" allowing the audience to send text messages to manipulate the Nintendo games being played in real time. This will involve working with Flask, the Twilio API, the FCEUX NES emulator and how to bridge them with quick Lua scripts.

good afternoon everyone

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,210
our first speaker for the afternoon is

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,920
Agnew and the title of his talk is

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,380
hacking classic Nintendo games with

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,519
bison so please give a warm welcome to

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,519
mr. Sam Agnew

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,010
how's it going Python I'm Sam Agnew I'm

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,470
a developer evangelist at Twilio and I

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,610
flew here from New York so who here

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,840
likes old video games cool that's a good

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,180
thing I think you're all in the right

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,940
place so when I was a kid I used to play

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,399
my Super Nintendo like every day and one

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,410
day my dad trash picked a Nintendo

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,510
Entertainment System so I fell in love

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,340
with that one too and I kind of always

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,079
had like an affinity for classic games

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,690
like even when newer systems come out

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,129
like I also play those but like like I

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,440
still have my Super Nintendo hooked up

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,079
in my apartment in New York so still all

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,090
about those so um naturally when I

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,980
started learning how to code and started

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,559
hacking on like side projects I'm in my

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,659
spare time for fun I kind of gravitated

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,100
towards that kind of stuff and I always

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,869
thought it'd be cool to like hook up

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,790
classic games to the Internet and

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,890
because the Internet is a magical place

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,330
and there's like an API for everything

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,100
right so I always thought it'd be cool

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,040
if like what if you're playing Metroid

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,930
and Samus could order pizza for you or

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,939
you're playing Megaman and you could

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,070
have it text your ex-girlfriend whenever

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,460
you like lose a life or something like

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,720
that right the possibilities are endless

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,840
right

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,979
so I decided for this talk it's going to

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,509
be a fun one we're gonna have some fun

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,540
and I'm going to like show you firsthand

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,409
how to how to you know hook up some old

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,329
Nintendo games to the Internet so you

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,500
might see on my screen here I have the

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,790
fceux Nintendo emulator running and I

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,380
have the Windows version of this

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,689
emulator running which is kind of

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,229
interesting so believe it or not there's

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,790
actually like a thriving community of a

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,130
Nintendo Entertainment System developers

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,420
like people who just like make old games

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,590
or fun like people are still writing

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,119
6502 assembly believe it or not and most

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,709
of these developers like I think they

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,990
use Windows machines so like a lot of

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,700
these like community like tools

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,900
whatever for windows machine so I'm

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,300
running the Windows version of this on

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,890
my Mac using wine because this comes

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,580
with some pretty pretty cool developer

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,470
tools like like one example this is let

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,540
me click this debug menu it's kind of a

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,520
kind of small I'm going to click click

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,870
this over here and I'm going to open

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,510
this thing called a hex editor so does

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,730
anyone heard of a hex editor before cool

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,040
so like some people here are familiar

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,640
with such things if you're not that's

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,190
cool that's not super complicated so

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,040
this this this like collection of

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,080
hexadecimal values over here is a this

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,910
is basically the memory of the game in

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,050
real time like this is just like what's

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,380
happening in the game so if I actually

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,620
like if I actually start a game we zoom

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,270
out you probably can't see like any of

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,890
the numbers I can't even so it's not

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,110
it's not that big of a deal I'm going to

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,580
pause that but like all these numbers

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,080
will start changing and stuff as things

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,190
happen in the game it's just this is

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,140
what's happening in the game this is

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,170
like the memory like on the side here

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,880
you have some hexadecimal like addresses

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,160
they correspond to address in the games

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,180
memory and over here you have the values

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,270
right um and a lot of times like hackers

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,220
will use this this tool to try to figure

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,680
out like to kind of take the game apart

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,450
reverse-engineer it and it's kind of fun

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,460
like you could you could always like try

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,650
searching through this and like finding

00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,240
what address corresponds to certain

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,250
things in the game like for instance if

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,200
I wanted to just like edit a couple of

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,260
numbers to kill Mario I could search

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,480
through the this hex table for like the

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,820
time up here I guess like right I have a

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,830
pause so it's 395 that's like how many

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,260
seconds or whatever unit of time this

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,500
game uses that I have left so if I like

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,250
if I open up this edit thing and I click

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,710
find

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,690
I can I can think I can assume that like

00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,910
a and I was testing this out earlier you

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,560
could assume that like this the 3 the 9

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,560
and the 5 are like stored sequentially

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,080
in memory somewhere so if I just search

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,590
for like the hexadecimal values like 0 3

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,870
0 9 0 5 I should find something cool

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,170
like it found something and over here

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,340
like if I unpause the game you should

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,810
see these like values are changing I

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,670
think because I assumed that I lost it

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,710
so I'm gonna

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,860
find that again real quick but if like

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:38,480
oh no the thing change I should pause

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:41,690
the game again what am i doing I have to

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:47,660
like get that ISO 375 right so if I

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:50,290
change these to seven now right so if I

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,700
change those zeros hypothetically

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,060
Mario should die right so I'm going to

00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:01,040
just change those cool so like I just I

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,890
just uh just killed Mario from a editing

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,220
some numbers on a screen that's my whole

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,660
talk see it that's just it so so anyway

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,040
like it you know you can mess around

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,110
with this stuff and like a lot of people

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,550
will like map out the RAM of a game by

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,010
just like if you google any like

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,990
arbitrary Nintendo game like Google like

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,390
Final Fantasy Ram map you might find

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,620
like a table with like oh this this is

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,560
the hit points of your character and

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,030
this address is whatever but what else

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,470
is cool about the Windows version of

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,270
some of these emulators is that you can

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,490
extend them by writing Lua scripts like

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,720
they give you this like environment so

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,180
that you can write a Lua script that

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,220
runs in the emulator and can manipulate

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,500
the game you can simulate button presses

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,140
you can edit the memory in real time

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,820
these are I think most commonly using

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,280
like the tool assisted speed running

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,590
community so people like write scripts

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,020
that will like play games in the most

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,000
optimal way and like will have it press

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,580
certain buttons at certain frames or

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,920
whatever um but it's kind of cool you

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,780
can have it edit memory too so let me

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,700
let me do like some some hello world

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,260
kind of stuff let's see I'm going to I'm

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,300
going to write a file called kill Mario

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,630
you ah

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:15,320
and so what I'm going to do is first I'm

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,810
going to fullscreen this make sure my

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,890
screen is like big enough I'm going to

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,390
I'm going to start off with like a quick

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,890
hello world I'm going to like call this

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,780
emulator object I'm going to write a

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,130
message to the screen and it's going to

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,560
be like just say hello PyCon smiley face

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,900
and then I'm going to kill Mario so this

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,640
is just going to be like a like a Lua

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,740
script that just prints hello PyCon and

00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,870
kills Mario so I can call like the

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,139
memory dot right byte function and I

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,169
give

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,180
hexadecimal address and value and if I

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,270
like look in this text editor and I zoom

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:52,039
in more it'll have like so the address

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:55,610
is 0 7f something let me count 1 2 3 4 5

00:06:52,039 --> 00:07:00,469
0 7 f8 is where the 3 is so that's like

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:05,599
FA F 9 FA so if I just write to that

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:08,300
byte 0 7 F 8 and if I write that byte as

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,490
0 it'll change that to a 0 so let me do

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,879
that with all three of those consecutive

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,689
values 9 and a is 10 and Jack's decimals

00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,340
so now if I go over to the simulator I

00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:24,469
think I'm done with the next Center now

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:27,830
I can run a Lua script new Lua script

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:29,900
window cool looks like I was already

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,849
running something from earlier ok cool

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,949
so I'm going to run my kill Mario Lua

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:38,740
and hopefully Mario will die if I if I

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,789
did it right cool

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:48,860
so a printed hello up icon on the screen

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:53,659
and we just wrote some code to make you

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:57,740
lose and Mario super useful as if I

00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:59,389
needed help so so that's cool so you see

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,710
like we have like a basic idea of like

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,509
you can write some code that runs in the

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,339
environment of game that's rad but what

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,810
can you do with this I think it'd be

00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,839
cool to like hook these games up to the

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,610
Internet right so what I'm going to do

00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,219
is you might you might be thinking like

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,839
wow editing the games memory as the game

00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,449
is playing that kind of sounds familiar

00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,610
for probably some of you who like had a

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,990
specific product that let you do this

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,430
when you were kid there's this thing

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,889
called the game genie who here had a

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,689
game genie you cheaters

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,699
when anyway you could use a game genie

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,409
and put in codes and those codes would

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,969
like to respond to like memory values

00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,529
and addresses and it would like change

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,320
it so you could have infinite lives or

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,419
whatever and I think it'd be cool if I

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,519
can make a game genie that all of us can

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,860
use while I play games on my computer at

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,320
PyCon so I'm going to be using the

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,589
Twilio API to build like a text message

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,690
powered game genie type thing where you

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,540
can text a Twilio number that I that I'm

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,279
programmatically controlling I'm going

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,779
to build that with a with flask that you

00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,310
were wondering where the pythons coming

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,450
in here cuz I've been writing Lua so

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,310
what I'm going to do is I'm going to I

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,350
need to write a Lua script that can

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,220
communicate with my Python flask app

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,810
sitting behind a phone number and I'm

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,240
going to use an extremely advanced

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,740
sophisticated algorithm what I'm going

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,660
to do is to communicate between these

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,209
two programs I'm going to write from a

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,920
text file in my Python program and read

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,110
from that text file in my Lua program

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,089
you know not going to not going to write

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,610
like a socket server anything like that

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:30,000
it's going to keep it simple so I'm

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,660
going to make a Lua file called an SMS

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,890
Lua

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,570
because like any s SMS I like puns and

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,250
I'm going to start off by writing a

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,709
function that just lets me read from a

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,290
text file give in like a file name or

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:45,449
whatever and this is going to be like a

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,579
basic file reading function I'm going to

00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,250
like create a variable for that input

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:52,769
and that's just going to just going to

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,320
open that file with the read flag and

00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:58,620
then I'm going to check to see if that

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,649
input is nil because if it is nil then

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,690
that files probably doesn't exist if

00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,329
it's not nil though I can do stuff with

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,120
it so I'm going to set our like the

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:11,640
input to be this this file and then I'm

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,500
going to store the contents of that file

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,980
in this variable just like read it as a

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,959
string and then I'm going to close the

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,870
that file because you always got to

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,180
close your files and now at this point I

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,620
have a string variable called content

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,890
that just has the contents of that file

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,779
I'm going to return that and outside

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,329
here I'm going to just return nil like

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,649
if the file doesn't exist so now I can

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:36,750
read from files and what I'm going to do

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,209
is I'm going to like I'm going to write

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,389
a loop that will

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,529
run on every frame of the game so so I'm

00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,649
going to I'm going to write an infinite

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,300
loop here so while true do and this is

00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,949
like my game loop a lot of times like

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,589
video games work on like an infinite

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:53,689
loop world it'll like play each frame of

00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,869
the game and some code will execute

00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,009
while that's happening and what I'm

00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,480
going to do here is at the end of each

00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:01,220
iteration of this loop I'm going to call

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,199
my frame advance function which will

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,910
advance to the next frame and what this

00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:07,759
effectively likes me lets me do is a

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,490
take programmatic control of like the

00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,439
game itself because this is this code is

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,959
is synchronous it's not it's not

00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:16,309
non-blocking so if I don't put that

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,689
frame advance function at the end of

00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,399
each loop it'll just be an infinite loop

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,929
running and the game will be stuck on

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,009
one frame forever and that will not be

00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:26,420
as fun so at the at the beginning of

00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:27,920
each loop I'm just going to read from

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,839
that text file so I'm going to store the

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,949
like what we're going to do is a you're

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,629
going to you're going to text my phone

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,300
number like four digit hexadecimal

00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:37,610
address like correspond you address in

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,170
memory a space and then a two digit

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,329
hexadecimal value I'm going to write

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,189
that add value to that address in memory

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:45,410
and I'm going to read them from some

00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:47,779
text files because you know easy way to

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,329
communicate so I'm going to read from

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:56,809
address text and I'm going to do the

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:58,220
same thing for value value text um what

00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,689
I'm going to do is on each frame of the

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,059
game I'm going to compare it to like the

00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:04,369
previous value that I had for that so

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,869
like because I give you text me if like

00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:07,279
one person in this audience like let's

00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:08,869
say you none of you want to help me out

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,790
and hack this game with me if only one

00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:12,199
person text like one time I don't want

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,720
it to just continuously write that on

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:17,209
every frame so I'm going to like have

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,290
some variables out here to keep track of

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:22,730
those as I go along and I'm going to

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,509
compare them to that so if they change

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,649
then I'm actually going to do stuff so

00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:32,029
so I'm going to compare these to each

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:34,189
previous value of those so if if that if

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:40,869
either one of these changes then I will

00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:40,869
do stuff with it cool

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:46,600
right all right so then not now if

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,600
something changed I know like all right

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,730
I need to do something so now I'm going

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
to convert them into hexadecimal

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,990
hexadecimal values so I'm going to

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,640
create like a hex address thing I'm

00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,350
going to call this a two number function

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,780
and I'm just going to give it the string

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,400
version of that address variable that is

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,120
just read from the text file and I'm

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,800
going to say like read that as a base 16

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:14,490
integer I'm going to do the same thing

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,530
for the value if I can spell value right

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:22,930
take that Jo there cool now do the same

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:24,400
thing here all right and then I'm going

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,780
to see if these are actual valid

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,240
hexadecimal numbers because you might

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,680
just send me one on hexadecimal numbers

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,900
and that'd be that wouldn't be as that

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,530
would be cool but you know someone might

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:38,140
might accidentally autocorrect stuff so

00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,750
we see if so if any of these are equal

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:45,580
to new then that means they're not real

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:47,710
hexadecimal numbers yes so if they're

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,160
both not equal to nil I'm going to do

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:53,500
that then I know I'm good to just write

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,450
some memory right here I'm going to call

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,040
my memory right byte function this is

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,140
this is the this is the meet this one

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,880
line of code this is like where the real

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,210
real action is happening this is like

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,300
the fun stuff memory doubt right byte so

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,770
I'm going to write the hex address I'm

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,040
going to write that hex value to that

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,300
hex address and I'm going to like print

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,740
out something I'm going to print

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,450
something out on the screen just so I

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,570
know like what's going on I'm gonna

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:23,080
print what address is being written to

00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,420
and what value it is string

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,120
concatenation in Lua is done with two

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,460
dots instead of a plus so that's what's

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,590
going on there and then at the end of

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,200
each iteration of this loop I'm going to

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:40,600
update my previous address in previous

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:44,050
value variables to like be current and

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,400
that that should be like that should be

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,130
all the Lua that I have to write

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:52,090
hopefully I didn't mess anything up so

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,490
I'm going to like open up this and open

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:57,660
this up and run that script

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,640
and see if it totally breaks cool so far

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,770
nothing broke so now I'm going to I'm

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,110
going to open like address text I was

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,580
like messing around earlier I have like

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,560
a couple of memory addresses like

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,360
already memorized in Super Mario Bros

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,470
because I guess I'm kind of a nerd and I

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,080
just know some memory addresses so zero

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,000
seven seven nine corresponds to like the

00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,399
color palette of the game so I'm going

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,700
to write to that and the value I'm going

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,149
to write to that is going to be 1f so if

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:30,690
I write 1f to that to that to that

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:32,070
memory address then the color palette

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,930
should change to be like black and white

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,959
so write to that

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,640
cool all right so my code works so

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,709
whenever those files change whenever

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,070
someone like writes to that file it'll

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:46,350
it'll reflect that change in the game so

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,000
I can change it back cool so now I'm

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,520
ready to like actually start writing

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,560
some Python we're at PyCon after all so

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,880
you know get doing that and get out of

00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,279
all here so I'm going to create an app

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,330
dot PI file and this is going to be just

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,190
a like a basic flash app what I'm going

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,600
to do here is I already have a Twilio

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,690
phone number like purchased and

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,370
configured to send post requests to a

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,890
flask app running on my local machine

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,330
whenever it receives a text message but

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,980
that app doesn't exist yet so if we're

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,870
going to build that now I'm going to

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,830
start off by importing the stuff I need

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,050
I'm going to import the regular

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,130
expression library because I want to I'm

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,810
going to use a regular expression to

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,140
make sure you're sending me hexadecimal

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,940
numbers and then I'm going to import

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,910
stuff from flask going to import the

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,580
flask object from the request object and

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,410
the Twilio Python library because

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,150
whenever whenever Twilio sends a text

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,930
message of this app I need to respond

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,329
with twimble

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,560
which is Twilio set of XML tags and

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:46,260
tells them what to do with the text

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,670
message and this will this will generate

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,459
the XML for me because no one wants to

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:55,079
write XML by hand and next I'm going to

00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:59,910
instantiate a flask app object and now I

00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:02,520
can create routes on this app so this

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,320
route is going to each a / SMS and it's

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,750
going to take post requests

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,030
and whenever a post request is sent to

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,589
slash SMS this SMS function will be

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,730
called and this is where I'm going to

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,530
this is where I'm going to like do all

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,500
the stuff and write to write to files in

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,690
the to communicate with this Lua script

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,610
running in the emulator so first I'm

00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,770
going to grab the message body from like

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,690
the text message so this will be in the

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,209
form encoded data of the post request

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,520
and the variable name is just body with

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:33,160
a capital B and that is the actual text

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,140
that you sent me my phone number so I'm

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,270
going to grab that I'm also going to

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,440
create a variable for like the text

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:44,920
message I'm going to respond to you with

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:48,660
something to say thanks for playing put

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,580
a smiley face in there and I will say

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,650
hit ups Agnew shreds on Twitter this is

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,630
my Twitter handle it's Sagna shreds

00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:00,630
because my name is Sam Agnew so it's s

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:03,100
Agnew and then shreds like on a guitar I

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,270
don't want I don't want my line to be

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,650
too long so I'm going to make this one

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:11,530
of those one of those multi-line strings

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:15,700
so hit up sagging shreds on Twitter for

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:19,180
questions cool put exclamation points

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,130
and super excited next I'm going to

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,350
create a variable for the error message

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,660
like so if you send me like invalid

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,010
input I'm going to respond with

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,030
something that's not thanks for playing

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,530
and respond with something that's like

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:34,630
hey you should enter something different

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:40,780
so say please enter a I'll say a four

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:45,330
digit hex address followed by a go to

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:49,240
that next line followed by a two digit

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:51,310
x-value to write to that address super

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,430
descriptive string and I'm going to put

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:56,740
some some backslash ends in there and

00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm going to give you an example so the

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:02,770
one I used was 0 779 1f and that will

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,850
change Mario's background to black and

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:09,660
white cool so now I'm going to I'm going

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:13,990
to split this body the message body by

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,180
spaces so I'm going to be able to get

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,200
like the address and the value from your

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,980
text message

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,450
and I'm also going to create a hex

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,190
pattern that I'm going to be able to use

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,980
to match against those to make sure that

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,850
those are hexadecimal numbers so I'm

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,919
going to compile one of those so let's

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,230
see here first I'm going to have a caret

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,299
to match the beginning of the string

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:42,230
then I want any character from 0 through

00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:43,609
9 or A through F or capital A through

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,149
capital F so we can make this case

00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:49,159
insensitive and then I want a plus sign

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:51,529
because I want the 0 I 1 or more of

00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,609
those and then a dollar sign because

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,830
that matches the end of the string

00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:58,700
hopefully hopefully this is not a

00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:02,690
terrible regular expression so now I

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:05,539
have the stuff I'm going to see if the

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,980
message list is actually like if the

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,200
length is equal to 2 to make sure you

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,989
didn't send me like anything with more

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,950
than one space in it and if it isn't

00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:15,169
then I'm going to send you my error

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,299
message but like be optimistic and the

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:18,919
first things first I'm going to deal

00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,649
with the optimistic case and see if you

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:25,220
do send me like correct input then I'm

00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:28,850
going to I'm going to unpack this list

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,179
into a into address and value variables

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,980
and I'm going to check to see if those

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:39,980
are valid hexadecimal numbers so oh

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:43,789
accidentally undid that cool so now I'm

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,440
going to call my X pattern I'm going to

00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:49,999
call the match function on the address

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,350
and the value so if it matches with both

00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,509
of them then we're good

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,489
then I know we're all we're all friends

00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,960
and you sent good input and I don't need

00:20:55,489 --> 00:21:00,830
to send you like a message telling you

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,289
send me better input cool so at this

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,690
point in the code we did everything like

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,830
you on your end it's assumed you did

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,269
everything right I'm going to like take

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:14,239
that address and write it to a text file

00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:16,809
so I'm going to open that file I'm going

00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:21,139
to start with address text first and

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:24,440
open that with the right flag and then

00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:26,690
just write I'm going to write the

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,259
address to that right and then I'm going

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,710
to do the same thing with the value

00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:34,220
notices like

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,860
going on here right into text files do

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,679
this all day

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:43,399
cool so now those those are taken care

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,260
of now if if they are not valid acted as

00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:48,169
monomers then I'm just going to respond

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,429
with the error message and then you're

00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:53,179
just going to send another message to

00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:55,429
try again and I think the last thing

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,320
ever it was I if the message list so if

00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:59,120
you send me more than one space in the

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,760
message than I know that your input was

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:08,779
also not super gray so I'm going to do

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,270
the same thing here let me make sure

00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:14,870
those line up because my text is super

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:17,690
big yeah it looks like they line up cool

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:21,220
I'll find out if they don't so alright

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,020
so next things next thing to do is um I

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,179
have to create a twill response object

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,039
using the Twilio Python helper library

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,169
and this is this is the object that I'm

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,169
going to use to respond to the requests

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:35,140
that Twilio sending my my flask app once

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,730
you send a text message to Twilio and

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,649
that response is just going to contain a

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,260
message which is going to be that

00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:44,630
response message string and I'm going to

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,360
return a string version of that response

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:50,020
object which will which will basically

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,640
just be my app spitting out some XML

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,419
next time I have to we're the fun part I

00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,190
can run my app now assuming like

00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:02,809
nothing's totally messed up so going to

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,700
run it I'm going to have I'm going to

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:06,649
set debug equal to true because I'm live

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,210
coding and who knows what can happen

00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:14,720
so debug equals true awesome no syntax

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:18,799
errors according to my FEM RC yet okay

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,429
so now I'm going to run that cool so far

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,169
so good

00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:22,399
I'm not going to give you all the phone

00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:24,159
number just yet because I want to I want

00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,750
to test it out myself

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,440
so Mario's cool right but does anyone

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,919
here like Zelda cool got anyone play the

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,380
new Zelda game rad I didn't I didn't yet

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,679
so I don't have a switch yet but I heard

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,630
it was pretty good though I'm gonna play

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,880
some Zelda though we're all going to

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,400
play some Zelda together instead of a

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,510
instead of

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,570
Mario but you already already seen

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:54,150
enough of that so me see open my recent

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:55,890
roms Legend of Zelda cool my computer is

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,500
playing the volume and that's cool so I

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:02,010
have a little a little a little sag new

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,840
over here and you see I'm just I have

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,240
made zero progress so far I don't even

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,350
have the sword yet I'm and if you're

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,030
familiar with this game you know you can

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,740
go into this cave and you can talk to

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,450
this creepy old man who says dangers to

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,420
go alone take this and then he gives you

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,100
a sword but I'm not trying to play this

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,740
game too legit way we're trying to hack

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,020
it we're trying to cheat so I'm I have

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,640
the sword on my phone here in a text

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,900
message and I'm going to text this phone

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:30,120
number the memory address is zero six

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,400
five seven I think and I'm going to text

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,580
it three which will give me the magical

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,370
sword and did it work oh way I'm not

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,980
running the script so okay cool now I

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,050
have it rad so I just gave myself a

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:48,330
story you see at the a slot I have a

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:50,700
sword transferred it from my phone shoot

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,400
that sword around so now I think I think

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,680
you all want to play this with me yeah

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,110
let's let's play some Zelda so I have I

00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,290
have a phone number if you pull all your

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:03,060
phones out and and by the way after this

00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,070
talk I'm going to send all of you like a

00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,510
blog post like detailing this

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,370
step-by-step like how to get all this

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,590
working so if I went too fast or

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,060
whatever you'll be fine so the way you

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,160
can get that is by texting this phone

00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,590
number too and playing this game so here

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,590
it is if you text seven four three one

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,330
zero I have some like some fun memory

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,210
locations already up on the screen if

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,390
you want to like find even more stuff

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,730
you can oh no I actually switch screens

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,270
if you can also like just Google like

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,410
Zelda RAM map and you'll find something

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:38,040
so I see people are starting to send

00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,780
some stuff in already someone someone

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,690
just like crash the game so but that's a

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,580
good thing

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:47,090
because like we're oh oh man the

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,809
emulator just straight-up died well

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:53,190
we're uh no that's good that's good well

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:54,989
we're at the point where it's like been

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,519
established that my code works so now at

00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:58,049
this point it's like if the game is

00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,849
crashing because you're sending like

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:03,509
you're hacking it that's like that means

00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:05,700
this demo is going well so this is very

00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:10,979
much by design let me open this open

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,979

00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:15,119

legend is all - where's Legend of Zelda

00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,080
there we go

00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:24,509
going to going to set that config to be

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,309
a bigger your aspect ratio this is a

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:28,470
super advanced emulator as you can see

00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:31,049
all right cool so now I have my Zelda

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,429

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,409
more minutes of this talk so we can we

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,239
can spend some spend some of that plane

00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,669

save no save states let's see where is

00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:51,659
this talks in SMS dot Lua okay we're

00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,249

00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,960

the screen that's pretty cool haha can

00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:09,479
someone try to crash the game again that

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,129
would be a I think someone finally crash

00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,529
