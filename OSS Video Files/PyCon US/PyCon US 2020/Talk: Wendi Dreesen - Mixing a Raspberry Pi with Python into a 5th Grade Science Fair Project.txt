Title: Talk: Wendi Dreesen - Mixing a Raspberry Pi with Python into a 5th Grade Science Fair Project
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Wendi Dreesen

I am proposing a talk that describes how to get started using a Raspberry Pi with Python. My child wanted to do a science fair project this year using the Raspberry Pi to collect the data. The project was to measure how long marbles would take to travel down different types of tracks: linear and curvy.

In the talk I present a few tips that should help to make a successful project. Then I proceed to describe the project in detail and how we broke it down into steps to get it completed.

hi I'll be talking about raspberry PI's

00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,550
and circuits but before I start I just

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,439
wanted to point out that we'll be

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,119
talking about circuits and circuits have

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,759
electricity and unfortunately

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,710
electricity is also an invisible hazard

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,199
so I want to point out a few good

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,960
practices that you and your student or

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,750
mint whoever you're mentoring like the

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,420
case was for me to practice so that

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,180
you're safe and also not going to damage

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,980
your hardware as well so remember to

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,980
turn off your Raspberry Pi every time

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,690
you make modifications to your circuit

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,030
make sure there's no food or drink near

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,460
the workspace work indoors and a dry

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,699
location don't work on a conductive

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,199
surface such as a metal table and if

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,180
you've never built electrical circuits

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,250
before be sure to follow the instruction

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,769
manuals very carefully heed the warnings

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,200
and be aware of some learning kits like

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,750
snap circuits which are great about

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,360
teaching how circuits work and also the

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,610
hidden dangers and how you can protect

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,530
yourself and make sure that you don't

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,770
damage the projects or the equipment

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,720
either with that I'm gonna start the

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,790
presentation mixing a Raspberry Pi with

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,640
Python into a fifth grade science fair

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,610
project my name is Wendy I have a

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,860
background in electrical engineering and

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,290
I also want to thank the PyCon committee

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,030
for choosing this talk I had a lot of

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,520
fun doing the project and really happy

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,470
to share it with all of you and in fact

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,740
the photograph that's in the center here

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,140
is from a summer science fair science

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,270
science fest actually that we have in

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,149
our town and this is the crazy science

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,759
booth at this booth they had these

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,310
wooden tracks of different shapes and

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,439
kids could go in and play with billiard

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,240
balls and see which ones would be slow

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,909
or fast and compare them with the

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,009
different tracks my son was very excited

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,020
about that project but he wanted to take

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,390
it to the next level and so for his

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,310
fifth grade science fair project he

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,970
wanted to actually measure the speed of

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,739
each ball going down a track and because

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,780
we had done some work with raspberry

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,310
PI's a couple summers ago he wanted to

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,410
use a Raspberry Pi to make those

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,450
measurements so today's talk

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,030
is basically some project tips to lead

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,740
you on a successful project whether it's

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,150
your own or if you're helping another

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,220
person like I was will summarize how to

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,530
get started with the Raspberry Pi while

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,440
using the GPIO with circuits and the

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,690
hardware GPIO in this case stands for

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
general purpose input output and those

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,620
are the pins that we'll be talking about

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,580
that we hook the Raspberry Pi into

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,220
external circuits we'll also talk about

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,040
some interesting difficulties that we

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,090
had during the project and share those

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,910
with you so some project tips first of

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,850
all critical warning big big news here

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,980
raspberry PI's can be super addictive so

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,470
in my case I had to practice a lot of

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,770
self-restraint and restrict myself to

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,830
only provide help when the student asks

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,900
for help a warning for you all it's easy

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,700
to let the project grow to this gigantic

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,950
size that you can't finish in the time

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,450
allotted so feel free to steer your

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,490
student if you think the project's

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,380
getting too big you can always promise

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,880
to add more things to the project later

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:38,490
if you finish early some information for

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,890
you seek help from your local college

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,830
professors or a local makers group with

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:47,430
your student if you need advice on say

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,320
tools or sensors don't worry about not

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,390
knowing the answer to everything we

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,610
can't be expected to know everything and

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,500
and it's all so good you might learn

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,230
something new from speaking to these

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,140
people another piece of information is

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,300
it's good idea to take a project and not

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,270
try to finish it all in one afternoon or

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,420
one day it worked really well where we

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:11,459
actually set up oxide a couple hours a

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,220
weekend for several weekends in a row

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,100
to work on the project I just it helps

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,010
break up the project reduces stress and

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:25,260
anxiety of trying to get it done by a

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:27,450
certain time debugging every project

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,830
needs to be debugged something's not

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,200
going to work something's gonna break

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,400
and when it's you're just not making any

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,280
progress and you see the frustration

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,919
levels going up feel freed at that point

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,629
to go take a walk or even better yet

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,309
just sleep on it

00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:45,959
also take pictures and videos throughout

00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:48,539
the project that's useful and finally

00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,939
try to stay as positive as possible

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:53,919
focus on the things that work and

00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,889
whenever you're stuck on a project or a

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,559
problem that you can't solve it's really

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,689
easy to start looking at the things that

00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:03,129
do work and narrowing it down so that

00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,049
you can find that one or maybe two

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:08,259
things that are not working and solve

00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:09,759
that problem and apply that to any of

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,509
the projects whether or not it's your

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,029
own or or you're helping somebody else

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:18,369
so the background of the project my

00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:21,309
husband and my son went to a hardware

00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:23,559
store and they bought some material to

00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:25,059
make tracks and it turns out it's in the

00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:26,919
picture there you're seeing the two

00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:29,919
tracks they built it's out of this

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,969
material that you normally would use to

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,089
hang say shelves on a wall and they bent

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:39,279
one and kept one the same and also you

00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,349
can't tell quite in the picture but the

00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,459
top and the bottom of each of them are

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:48,639
at the same height so the question we

00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:51,849
had was now that you've got this set of

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,179
tracks and we want to measure speed how

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:56,769
do you do that I wasn't really sure how

00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:58,839
to do that I didn't have any background

00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:01,839
in and myself so we ended up talking to

00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,349
a ex college professor that we knew

00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:08,949
who's taught physics 101 and his

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:11,919
recommendation was use a photo gate so

00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,529
what is a photo gate the blue shape that

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,159
you see in the in the drawing here is a

00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:20,709
photo gate it has two parts to it the

00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:22,569
left side of this particular drawing is

00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,279
what your is your light source so the

00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,860
light source could be an LED a light

00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,169
emitting diode or it could be a laser

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,589
and then on the other side you have a

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,869
photo transistor and a photo transistor

00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:37,239
will basically detect whether or not it

00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:39,999
can see that light or is something in

00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:42,309
the gate that's blocking that light now

00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:44,919
a photo transistor is essentially a

00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:47,499
special type of transition transistor

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,800
and it's a switch and the beautiful

00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:52,530
thing about this switch is that when you

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,860
shine light on it

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,440
the switch allows current to flow and if

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,990
you don't shine light on it the switch

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,450
is open and no current can flow through

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,150
it and so it's the same type of switch

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,970
like you would use as a switch in a room

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,330
to turn on a light same type of concept

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,870
and what's really cool about this is

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,320
that when it sees light the voltage will

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,290
be low and when it doesn't see light the

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,480
voltage will be high and the circuit to

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,990
the right is a diagram for those of you

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,850
who are familiar with circuits and for

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,560
those of you would not familiar with

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,930
circuits just to understand that when

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,180
the beam is blocked you'll see a low

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,280
voltage and when the beam is blocked

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,919
you'll see a high voltage and when we

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,590
get to the Raspberry Pi part low

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,150
voltages are equivalent to zero and high

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,980
voltages are equivalent to the number

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,800
one and we'll talk a little bit more

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,380
about that later now that we knew that

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,590
we're going to use a photo gate we

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,600
decided to get on to Google and look at

00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,100
YouTube and see if anybody had actually

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,780
built a photo gate for the Raspberry Pi

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,390
because we didn't really know how to get

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,270
started well it turns out the link that

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,729
I show here from YouTube is a really

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,770
nice video that's done on how to get

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,050
started with a photo gate using the

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,660
Raspberry Pi and so it was the basis of

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:20,880
what we use to put this project together

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,710
ok so getting started of the Raspberry

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,860
Pi how do you get started what's the

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,540
right order to do things so for those

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,340
who have never used a Raspberry Pi

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,280
before I would direct you to the

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,580
Raspberry Pi that word website and they

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,169
have a bunch of vendors listed that have

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,260
all sorts of different kits with

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,060
different parts that you can get so

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,680
Kanak it was an excellent kit I'll be

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,560
talking about that in a little bit and

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,430
then also be aware that there are

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,280
several Raspberry Pi versions version 4

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,570
just came out recently version 3 is what

00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,720
we used for our kit and it's older and

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:03,360
also the kits often come with a micro SD

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,880
card with noobs noop stands for new

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,360
out-of-the-box software but essentially

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,630
it's a

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,450
bein Linux operating system you plug

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,310
into the Raspberry Pi and when you boot

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,709
it up like you would any other computer

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,680
it boots up with a graphical user

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,779
interface such as you know Max or

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,810
Windows or any other type of flavor of

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,160
Linux that you might run it's same sort

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,160
of thing and it's really nice you can

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,959
get in there it logs you in and you can

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,390
play with it they've got a lot of

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,149
pre-installed software pythons already

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:39,440
on there and there's even some IDs to

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:42,899
play around with Python software so it's

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,940
really kind of a ready to go kit that

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,040
helps you get going and so that's why I

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,560
recommend a kit is a really good way to

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,779
go if you've never used them before if

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,000
you don't get the kit be sure though to

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,700
get the micro SD card unless you like

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,430
installing operating systems on a mic or

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,720
downloading the code and putting it on a

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,640
micro SD card the last thing I would

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,529
also recommend is that if you're

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,899
familiar with using virtual environments

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,459
definitely use them if you're not that

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,250
familiar with virtual environments there

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:16,500
are a lot of online resources that you

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,300
can basically Google virtual environment

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,000
and there'll be descriptions of how to

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,070
set them up and they're a really nice

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,850
way so that each project that you have

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,220
will have a different set of installed

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,010
dependencies from the Python package

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,560
manager and so it's just a good way of

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,269
doing it now before I flip to the next

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,279
slide I just want to point out in this

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,320
photograph at the very top of the

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,720
Raspberry Pi picture you'll see a row of

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,769
pins sticking out of it that is your

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,720
GPIO connector so to get hooked over to

00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:51,329
your circuits you need some way to

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,149
access those pins in a very handy and

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:58,230
useful manner and so that's where we

00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:01,170
move on to getting a a kit for doing

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,290
that and the kit I recommend is free no

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,110
V's Altamonte starter kit it's a $50 kit

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,149
from Amazon and what I liked about it is

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,279
that they provide the ribbon cable which

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,930
is that gray cable that's coming over to

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,449
this breakout board they provide the

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,810
breakout board with the labeling for all

00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,800
the different GPIO pins and you can take

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,600
that and plug that

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,339
into a solderless breadboard and that's

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,040
what you see in that upper right picture

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,450
the middle picture also short shows sort

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,480
of a perspective view where you can see

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:33,420
the Raspberry Pi connected via the

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,029
ribbon cable over to a solderless

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,490
breadboard so that kind of gives you an

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,089
idea of how it all gets connected

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:44,940
together now what I also like about free

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:47,190
no V's kit is that it's got some LEDs

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,620
and some motors and displays and number

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:53,130
pads they have a github repository and

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,920
then a PDF tutorial and the tutorial

00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:00,360
walks you through every single device so

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,980
the first tutorial is take an LED grab a

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,660
resistor and that's going to be your

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,329
current limiting resistor and it shows

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,910
you exactly how to wire it up to this

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:11,070
breakout board and then they have sample

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,649
code that immediately start once you get

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,649
it running will blink the LED and it's

00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,829
like your own hello world for circuit

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:22,560
hardware to get that LED blinking and so

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:25,170
it's really nice kit is a really nice

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,640
PDF tutorial and I like how they go into

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,390
great detail if you've never done it

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,880
before now one little gotcha that I

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,190
wanted to point out is it may not be

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,110
totally obvious how to plug the ribbon

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:42,959
cable from the GPIO header over to the

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,200
board and not get that messed up so a

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,329
little trick that you can do is you can

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,399
take your Raspberry Pi and flip it over

00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:52,320
and that's what the bottom right hand

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,810
picture is is that you're looking at the

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,510
backside of those pins the dual rows of

00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,940
pins one all the pins will be circles

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:03,510
but one will be a square and that square

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,060
is your pin number one now ribbon cables

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,399
also will have one side that's painted

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,440
red so what you want to do is make sure

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
that the red side is on the same side

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,970
that that square pin is once you flip

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,890
the board back over and then just be

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,410
really careful when you plug the

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,970
connector into the row of pins make sure

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,070
you're not offset you want to match

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,199
every single pin for every single hole

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,970
in that connector and that's the only

00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:28,680
drawback of using those types of

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,690
connectors is they're not keyed in any

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,970
way to keep prevent you from plugging it

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,839
in wrong you can plug it in wrong

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,310
so just take extra care when you do that

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,069
the next thing I wanted to go over is

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,110
some recommended tools get a breadboard

00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:45,360
wiring kit and the picture to the far

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,459
right is a picture of one of those kits

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,230
it's really handy it's a bunch of

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,910
colored wires different lengths and

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,040
they're already pre stripped for you and

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,439
they fit perfectly into the holes of the

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,939
solderless breadboard and because

00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:59,399
they're all different lengths you could

00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:01,079
find the right length to go between what

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,790
items you're trying to connect in your

00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,860
solderless breadboard and they're just

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,990
super handy to have especially the fact

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,850
that they're pre stripped another type

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,189
of wire you can get are these wires that

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,439
have the big black heads that you can

00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:15,750
plug into the different holes in the

00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:18,689
solderless breadboard and then another

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,370
type of wire that's cool is on one side

00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,689
you plug it into the solderless

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,120
breadboard and then there's a nice

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:26,100
alligator clip on the other side if you

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,589
need to attach to something external to

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,529
the solderless breadboard these types of

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:34,920
wires are easily found at places like

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:37,259
sparkfun or Adafruit or even Amazon so

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,209
feel free and take a look at the

00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:43,319
different items you can get to help you

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:45,120
build up your circuits quicker the next

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:48,720
thing I wanted to suggest is getting a

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,269
good multimeter this is a fluke 179 that

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,519
I use I bought it so that I have one

00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:56,790
meter that I use forever and it's a

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,790
great robust multimeter that should last

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,439
you a lifetime now I understand it could

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,480
be out of your price range and that's

00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:06,509
understandable so if you're gonna buy

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,269
some el cheapo multimeters if you can

00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:11,399
buy two of them and that way if one's

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:12,930
reading weird you can use the other just

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,910
a double check that it's working right

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,629
I've helped numerous people with

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,009
multimeters where one wasn't working and

00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:21,300
they were going crazy because it just

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,059
they couldn't figure out what's going on

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,649
and it was the meter the last thing I'm

00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:29,220
going to point out is the bottom left

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:31,290
picture is a picture of perforated board

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,300
so when you're using a solderless

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,279
breadboard and putting up some sample

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,199
circuit the idea is that when you're

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,029
done you just pull the components off of

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,040
them and you're done but you might want

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,019
to save it so if you want to be able to

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,639
save a circuit that you've built you can

00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,470
use perf board now you'll have to learn

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,930
a skill called soldering to be

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,790
able to solder your items on in there

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,310
and make it perfect I'm not a perfect

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,700
but a a permanent board and that's

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,370
wonderful to do but you'll have to learn

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:02,790
this this the soldering skill so just so

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,560
you're aware so I've talked about

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,370
solderless breadboards well how do you

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,330
use one

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,860
so on your GPIO cable or breakout board

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,780
that's going to come over and plug into

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,460
the breadboard there's going to be two

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,200
things you're going to need to wire in

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,880
you're going to need to wire in your

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,700
voltage rail and you're going to need to

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,130
wire in your ground rail and the voltage

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,350
there's actually two voltages produced

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,550
by a Raspberry Pi there's a five volt

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:33,660
one and there's a 3.3 volt 1 and the 5

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:35,040
volt could go say in that top row that

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,180
you see here and then you could put

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,090
maybe the 3.3 volt rail and the bottom

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,950
one there and and the red lines that

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,750
I've drawn on the solderless breadboard

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,440
they're supposed to show how the pins

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,260
are connected so once you plug 3.3 volt

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,080
and to say that red line there every

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,770
hole that's along horizontally will all

00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,730
see that 3.3 volts the ground is also

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,440
the low potential reference point for

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,610
your circuit that needs to be the same

00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,320
between your circuit and also your

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,910
Raspberry Pi and so that also needs to

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,450
be plugged in so you'll want to take the

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,760
pin that says GND on your breakout board

00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,920
and plug that into one of those black

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,040
rows it could be the top one or the

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,040
bottom one or both if you prefer just

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,020
know how you've wired it up now the

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,540
center of the solderless breadboards

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,700
wired differently the pins are wired

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,800
vertically and those little short red

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,100
lines going up and down shows you how

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,310
they're connected together now we didn't

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,920
use these for our project but they are

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,780
very common so I took a picture or a

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,690
grabbed a picture from Wikipedia of a

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,880
dual inline package part so if you use

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,880
timers or an Gates or or gates they'll

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,530
be packaged in this type of part when

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,150
you get one you can see the pins

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,530
sticking out of them they actually are

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,360
designed to go straight into your

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,390
breadboard so you would just shove

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,450
straight down plug it in and now through

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,790
the pins that are sticking out from or

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,679
the holes sticking out from the pin that

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,350
they're plugged into now you have access

00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,330
to all the pins on that part and now you

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:20,429
have the ability to wire up that circuit

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:22,230
so those are just a few tips you want to

00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:25,290
try to keep your wiring as clean as

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,059
possible and try to be as neat as you

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,240
can because it makes it easier to debug

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,870
your circuit and the last tip I wanted

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,040
to throw out is that after you're done

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,480
breadboard in your circuit one thing I

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,400
like to do is I like to take my

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,940
multimeter I like to put it in the

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,600
resistance mode or the ohm mode and plug

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:49,970
my black probe into either of the ground

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:53,250
rails and then plug my red probe into

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:56,580
both if I'm using both the 5 volt rail

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:59,010
and the 3.3 volt rail and check that I'm

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,620
not reading zero ohms between them if

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,540
you're reading zero or one or two ohms

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,049
that means that somewhere in your

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,990
circuit you've managed to almost or just

00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:12,150
about wire or short your gold to drill

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,350
to your ground rail and that means that

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,179
when you turn on your circuit you're

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,790
going to get a big puff of smoke or

00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,410
damaged parts or Carvin across your

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,750
circuit and maybe even damage your

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,090
Raspberry Pi so it's it's a good thing

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:27,450
to check that out just before you get

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:30,059
started now we've talked about the

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:33,090
hardware it's time to go to software so

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:35,790
we have Python 2 and python 3 available

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,250
on all the the 2 raspberry PI's I looked

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,429
at so like I said before we used a

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:44,309
Raspberry Pi model 3 and we did it with

00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:47,730
Python 2 not realizing that was

00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:50,400
important now that Python 2 has been the

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:54,570
support for it has ended as of January

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,910
1st but what we did install is the first

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,520
lines there the get clone the build and

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,980
there's GPIO - V which is a command that

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,530
checks to make sure that your GPIO has

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,650
been installed and then we did finally

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,559
up one last pip install of the RPI GPIO

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,030
package that is what we needed to do now

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,910
it looks like you can kind of replace

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,700
that with pip install wiring

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,160
but what I found even cooler than that

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,990
was that after I heard about the

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,150
Raspberry Pi 4 I thought well let's try

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,250
this canna kit and I really like the can

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,440
of kit it's really good for someone

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,120
who's never used it but the other thing

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,700
I really liked about it is if you type

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,830
Python at the command line on the

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,840
canikin it already comes with two seven

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,890
sixteen and then if you type Python

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,370
three to the command line

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:44,960
it's got installed three seven three and

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:48,980
then pip which is the package installer

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,270
it if you use pip without the three it's

00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,060
telling you which packages have been

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,100
installed for two and if you use pip

00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,240
three which was they were both there

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,780
they both lists

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,280
RPI GPIO version zero six five already

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,080
installed so you didn't have to install

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,630
any software it just worked right out of

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,460
the box so that was really cool and then

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,770
just be aware that you can also clone

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,160
the software from github for free novae

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,840
and it's the free novi ultimate starter

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,000
kit and that's where you get the Python

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,370
code for all of the different devices

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,660
such as the LEDs or motors and all the

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,960
things that you can play with in their

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,390
kit now I want to talk a little bit

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,460
about how to use a diode why well we had

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,580
to use some LEDs for our circuit and

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,260
just be aware that a diodes job is to

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,090
allow current to only flow in one

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,970
direction in this case it goes from the

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,580
anode to the cathode a cool trick you

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,260
can learn using your multimeter is if

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,790
you grab an LED and you have no idea

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,630
what direction it's supposed to be which

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,670
is usually the case at least for me

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,540
maybe there's a good way to look at it

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,800
but I just my eyes aren't that good but

00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,610
what you want to do is take the red

00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,960
probe of your multimeter put the black

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,420
probe so the red probe is gonna go on

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,690
one leg of the LED and then the black is

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,790
going to go on the other leg put your

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:11,100
multimeter into diode mode and if it's

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,020
set up correctly it will light up if it

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,270
doesn't light up just switch the probes

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,760
and now you've figured out the direction

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,260
of your LED now I'm going to go ahead

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,230
and run the little video here while I

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,810
talk about the IR diode that we needed

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,690
for this project so I R stands for

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:32,399
infrared and here we have a little

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:35,190
I don't where we've got the IR LED wired

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:37,200
up and the question was is how do we see

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,769
and then infrared is not in the human

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,779
visible range so we were able to plug it

00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,250
in and then plug it take it off and you

00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,799
could see that there's a little tiny

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,440
light there that little tiny light is

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,779
the IR LED shining and the way we were

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,700
able to figure out that it was on is we

00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,559
tried a couple of cell phones in our

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,559
house and it turned out our newest cell

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,450
phone could see in the infrared region

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,389
so you put it in camera mode and then we

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:06,059
were able to shoot this little video now

00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:08,100
just note how dim that light looks

00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,659
because that's going to feed into the

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,700
next slide I'm going to talk about and

00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,830
one last thing is when you are playing

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,750
with LEDs don't forget your current

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,460
limiting resistor if you plug an LED

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,470
aren't straight on a power source such

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,210
as a battery you're just going to drain

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,940
all the current out of it in no time and

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,730
you might actually burn your hand while

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,440
you're holding it or burn up the LED so

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,539
just be aware that you need to always

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,809
have a current limiting resistor when

00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:36,000
you're playing with daya's so that

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,980
little tiny IR diode wasn't bright

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
enough to see and it turned out once we

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,909
put it on a gate you just it always

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,830
showed that the light was blocked it

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:45,799
never could see any light so what we did

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,990
is we went ahead and just replaced the

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,570
LED the IR LED with these little finger

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,149
flashlights that the photo transistor

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,830
was able to detect so the red box there

00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:59,759
just shows that little battery that we

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,679
used the green box shows what our photo

00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,419
transistor circuit looks like and that's

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,860
the receiving end of the photo gate I've

00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,230
also got a little picture of a little

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,090
tiny photo transistor there I mean we're

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:13,500
talking millimeters by millimeters a

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:15,480
little part to see it but essentially

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,360
all we do is wire that up and why are

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,009
each this two so we needed a start gate

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,740
and a stop gate to be able to measure

00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:24,269
when the marbles left the beginning of

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,740
the track and then when they got to the

00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:27,870
end of the track so that's why there's

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,799
two of them and each of those is wired

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:35,009
into GPIO address line 17 and 18 is what

00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,519
we used for this kit and then the blue

00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:41,490
box shows what I call my sanity circuit

00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,620
and that was wired up to just one of the

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,100
or one of the photo gates where we would

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,020
basically put our hand in between the

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,450
phototransistor and this light source

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,580
and just see if that LED flashes on and

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,620
off and as it flashes on and off you

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,860
could say whether or not that circuit

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,930
was working so it was a good check the

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,300
other quick thing I want to mention is

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:06,150
that I didn't have a circuit drawing or

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,760
a schematic drawing program at home so I

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,820
went to circuit diagram or graph found

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,250
that online and I was thrilled that they

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,500
even had a Raspberry Pi breakout board

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,080
so if you want to draw your own circuits

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,670
feel free to go to this website and draw

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,920
your own circuits and build them all up

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,590
it's it's really nice that's a nice

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,260
feature

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:31,380
now GPIO inputs can be challenging

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,180
because outputs are easier because you

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,830
can basically blink the LED and go yep

00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,050
it's working or nope it's not maybe I

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,140
gotta go check the address but inputs

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,910
how do you know they're working so first

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,980
of all you want to find your addressing

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,350
so Kanak it again I really liked because

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,860
they have this nice color print out of

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,890
the GPIO pins and they're colored and it

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,370
tells you what addresses which pen super

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:58,770
handy you can also at least on the older

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,800
raspberry PI's use the GPIO read all

00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:06,120
command and that will print out an ASCII

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,640
display of the entire pin out of and the

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,580
addresses for those pens so just be

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,440
aware you could use that and the next

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,480
thing that we did is we actually wrote a

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,980
little tiny piece of code and all this

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,920
code does is it just sits there and

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,680
checks the particular address and sees

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,800
if you can see changes on it so what we

00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:29,430
do is we import this in the RPI GPIO

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,970
package then we set up the GPIO which is

00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,530
simply GPIO set mode for GPIO board and

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,360
then you want to make sure that you've

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,700
picked an address that you're interested

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,860
in and then use GPIO and a set that it's

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,780
going to be an input pin and then the

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,970
try loop just continues and reads that

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,230
pin so if there's changes you should see

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:51,900
them so in our case we plugged in picked

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,930
an input for one of the transit trans

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,480
photo transistors on the receiving side

00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,780
of the

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,570
Gate kept that running and we would look

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,310
to see if we would see 1 or 0 1 or 0 and

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,350
sure enough if it was wired correctly

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,940
and he had the address is correct you

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,340
could see that change and so this is a

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,040
nice useful piece of test code to check

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:27,880
that out now I'm going to let this run

00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:29,950
this is the experiment and this kind of

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,570
shows you where the start gate is and

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,730
where the end gate is and the little

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,750
photo in the bottom right is the picture

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,730
of on poof board the circuit to build up

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,620
the little photo transistor there and

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:46,480
that little tiny square is the photo

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,940
transistor that we use ok so now we just

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,500
need to modify that input code so that

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,990
we can take care of all the different

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,730
states so the states that we have we

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,220
have a start state we have the first

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,020
marble has arrived state then we have

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,420
another wait state because we want to

00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,530
wait until that first marble leaves the

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,180
end gate and then make timing for this

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,030
when the second marble arrives at the

00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,520
second gate and just be aware that while

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,170
this thing is running that there's

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,170
probably on the order of maybe a

00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,760
thousand Reed's per second so you want

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,770
to make sure that you wait long enough

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,140
before you try to measure the second

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,600
marble because it's basically going to

00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,720
stay high for a while while that marble

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,220
is traveling through that gate now if

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,290
that doesn't make any sense to you

00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,920
another way to think about it is using a

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,380
time chart so in this case 1 equals the

00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,750
gate is blocked and 0 means a gate is

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,290
open and what I have is 2 columns

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,970
showing in time the start gate on the

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,190
left side and the end gate on the right

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,980
side so when the marbles are sitting up

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,890
at the start gate the gate is blocked

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,320
until you see a 1 and what we're waiting

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,300
for is when they both leave then we

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,520
start the timer because we see that

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,610
they've that there's a zero there those

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:06,100
timers started and we're gonna wait now

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,809
we're waiting for the first bar ball to

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,539
arrive the end gate when that happens we

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,220
can record the first time then we need

00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,440
to sit there and read and read and read

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,440
until that first marble has cleared that

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,149
gate and once it's left the gate then we

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,639
can say okay now we're waiting for the

00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:24,649
next marble and when the next marble

00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:28,129
comes in we can record the second time

00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:30,710
and now this is the code that basically

00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:33,049
sets that up now I know there's a lot on

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,999
one slide so if you don't want to stare

00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:37,759
at this slide we i've also provided a

00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:41,090
github site where i've stuck the source

00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,950
code for also that input test code and

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:45,230
then this code as well that you're

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,330
welcome to take a look at but in in just

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,950
sort of a high-level overview everything

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,830
on the left side is getting everything

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,169
set up and then the very bottom or says

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,119
initialize gate change state those are

00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:58,279
just a bunch of flags that help you

00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,590
figure out what state we are in are we

00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:03,649
waiting for the first are we waiting for

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,539
the marbles to leave the first gate has

00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:08,179
the first marble come is the second

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:10,340
marble done and are we done so those get

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,440
all set up and then the right-hand side

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,840
is basically a wild true loop that runs

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,999
runs continuously and it's just polling

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,399
where we are in those different states

00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:21,110
so when it sees the state that hey were

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,970
at the first marble go ahead and time it

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:27,830
when it sees that it's got the first

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,360
marble but the first marble is still

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,470
there it's just sitting there waiting

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,080
and waiting and waiting and waiting

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,119
until it leaves and then it's ready to

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,279
measure for the second marble and then

00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:42,049
when everything's done it records the

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,570
two times so when this code runs what

00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:47,480
you're gonna see is essentially a start

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,700
time and a stop time a start time and

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,340
two stop times for each of the marbles

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,860
and then the calculated travel time of

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,009
each marble and so that's what my son

00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:01,610
used for his project he did time trials

00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:05,679
so he did I think ten of them per per

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:09,080
marble or I should say he did ten ten

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,950
executions down the track and then he

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,749
took that data and he likes a jupiter

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,960
notebook so he put the data into pa'dar

00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:21,740
notebook and did a plot of the different

00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,680
runs and how the timing came out for

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,250
each of those runs

00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,470
so that was his science fair project and

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,930
he was super excited to do it and seem

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,900
to have a lot of fun with it and enjoyed

00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,730
playing around with the data to conclude

00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,630
just want to remind you to be safe with

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,950
electricity again take small steps when

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,100
you're putting your project together and

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,290
I think that's what helped us out a lot

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,790
define addresses before you get started

00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,760
so that you kind of have an idea of

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,920
where you're going and you know that

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,630
whatever pin you're using is going to be

00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,640
mapped whatever address you've picked

00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:00,780
and just if it doesn't work there's

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,880
there's test code to try things out use

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,520
small test codes and small pieces of

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,650
hardware to check out stuff and build up

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,230
your project I think that helps too and

00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,120
in this case we use states with flags to

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,300
define the measurement points but maybe

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,780
there's another way that can be done and

00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:21,300
finally the last slide here is we have

00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:25,530
some references and useful links on this

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,270
page just a quick picture my son ended

00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,830
up getting to go to district Science

00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,460
Fair which was super cool any place

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:34,590
third so we're really proud of him and

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,870
the references and links that are here

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,300
are all that we're listed in the slides

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,550
and then finally at the bottom if you

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,170
have any questions and want to contact

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,540
me feel free to contact me through

00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,670
LinkedIn I'd be happy to answer any

00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,210
questions or if you have any comments

00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,580
I'd love to hear from them thank you for

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:56,000
attending this talk and I hope you have

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,000
