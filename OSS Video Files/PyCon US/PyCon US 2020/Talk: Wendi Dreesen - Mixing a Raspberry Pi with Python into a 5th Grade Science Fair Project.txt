Title: Talk: Wendi Dreesen - Mixing a Raspberry Pi with Python into a 5th Grade Science Fair Project

Wendi Dreesen

I am proposing a talk that describes how to get started using a Raspberry Pi with Python. My child wanted to do a science fair project this year using the Raspberry Pi to collect the data. The project was to measure how long marbles would take to travel down different types of tracks: linear and curvy.

In the talk I present a few tips that should help to make a successful project. Then I proceed to describe the project in detail and how we broke it down into steps to get it completed.
