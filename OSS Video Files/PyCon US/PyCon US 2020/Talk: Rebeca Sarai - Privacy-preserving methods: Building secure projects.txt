Title: Talk: Rebeca Sarai - Privacy-preserving methods: Building secure projects
Publication date: 2021-05-05

Rebeca Sarai

Customers’ data is important. The number of privacy laws in recent years has grown from 20 to 100, to name a few: PCI compliance in the payment industry, the European GDPR regulation, and the Brazilian LGPD. All these new regulations attempt to bridge an old gap: data anonymity. How to handle data and protect the individuals comprised in it? Companies often face lawsuits to compensate for personal information breaches in their database.

Many times production data is copied onto test, QA or staging environments, only to be followed by exposure to the eyes of testers, receivers, or unauthorized developers on machines less protected than production environments. It is not seldom for files also to be shared with external partners, who often require but a small part of the data transferred, and granting access to user’s data might be a breach. If in one hand sharing data is both necessary and inevitable, on the other technologies that assure the privacy of individuals details are no longer only desirable, but essential.

In this talk, we will approach two important topics: how to manage data whilst securing users’ personal information and how to do it in machine learning models. Exposing different techniques of anonymization and pseudonymization (k-anonymity, differential privacy, and others), showing that solving the anonymity problem is much more complex than replacing names, last names, and social security numbers.

everyone I hope that you're all fine

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,009
giving this situation my name is Rebecca

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,009
and I'm gonna talk today a little bit

00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:27,490
about privacy preserving methods of how

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:29,980
to do secure projects so my name is

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,210
Rebecca I'm from Mississippi brezner is

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,210
a place nearly a graduating population

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:41,830
here in the university of I'm very proud

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:45,040
to have been a student at both man and I

00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,799
worked as a software engineer at Victor

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,799
software we are kind of team of experts

00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,470
from Brazil you're amazing Brazil and we

00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,080
help clients avoid problems from

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,180
back-end continent and design the

00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,559
infrastructure pretty much everything

00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:05,019
you need okay I'm gonna talk today a

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,830
little bit about security in practice

00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,659
and I envy a lot of people that don't

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,510
have any type of concern about this

00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:17,800
mission would was one of those people

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:21,040
but fortunately I am NOT and I'm very

00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,570
concerned about this topic and this is

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,700
pretty much what I've learned a lot of

00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,820
big companies in they really like to

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,830
test what they can do with our data and

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,540
it was bring to you just a few examples

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:37,480
of a few misses list of privacy breaches

00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:41,380
that were caused by big by big companies

00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,500
my favorite one is this one

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:48,159
that they are able to like show to

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,800
everyone a location of secret US

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,820
military base that's quite interesting

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:59,110
and we have like governments now and

00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:03,159
they were trying to regulate to sure

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,640
that people like have privacy while we

00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,900
use

00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,880
like applications and systems but I

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,020
don't know what to think about that but

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,270
I don't know if any good came out of

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,150
this we have a bringing I've been to you

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,000
to me examples of a guy who just use an

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:26,320
app to track like his ride on his bike

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,050
and I'm making that robbery and this is

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,330
I said for my hometown where they are

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,300
using like mobile phones to monitor

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,709
social isolation I don't know how I feel

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,470
about that to make sure that the

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,110
government has the right to do this to

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,050
citizens but it's not a fate that we

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,989
need to have as a society and the

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,560
consequences of all this like debates

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,209
and discussion is the first scientists

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,540
they don't have enough data to build

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,940
like new models because basically all

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,550
the most important and data is in the

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,650
hands of big companies and I think the

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,380
worst thing is that we don't feel safe

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,870
we think that we are being watched all

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,780
the time and it's like we can't do

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,480
anything to solve this and I can't start

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,340
to show you that we there's a few things

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,570
that we can do and I'll show your face

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,060
situations when we can hurt the privacy

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:28,120
of some users but I'm gonna showing ways

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:30,750
on how to protect the privacy and then

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,019
we're gonna go to more like complex

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:38,170
situations so I would like to start with

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,510
the very simple situations like you want

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:49,829
to collect and release data then put

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:55,019
things answers to questions and then

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:57,790
just like get statistics out of this

00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,420
when I say sensitive questions like

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,569
really means mystic question

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,790
like assume then I'm at it and I'm gonna

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:08,120
ask my questions like have you ever used

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,700
illicit drugs to me hence performance it

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,800
has two options we have like a clean yet

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,290
that didn't use drugs and we have an

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,829
athlete that may have used drugs used

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,680
and assuming that these people answer

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,020
the question honestly we will have like

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,889
a database and we'll be able to do like

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,190
we responded this dataset but there's a

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,190
problem

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,270
- just at this it doesn't mean that I'm

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,340
protecting Travis just by no alignment

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,530
to get individuals names doesn't mean

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,050
that I have privates this is like oh you

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,610
can see that with questions I can know

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:54,680
for sure was if Jamie used OT no use of

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,900
the Citrix and that's why statistics are

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,940
not safe the name of the attack the

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,650
witches are simulated by asking

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,500
different questions call it fancy

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,229
attacks and we can do many more types of

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,169
attacks they just trying to find

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:11,750
individual information that identifies a

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,960
humanist so we must be careful with like

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,340
allowing people to do queries over large

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,470
datasets but let's continuing on this

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,550
situation I still want to do this and I

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,580
still wanna do this

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,850
protecting try this how should I do it

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,460
you still have the same question we

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:37,820
still have two options the differences

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:40,220
then now managers do something and

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,340
bigger collection time so I'll give the

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,570
user the athlete a point and I'll say

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,940
take the point

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,390
don't let me see the result if the coin

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:54,380
is hands we answer yes you have views

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:59,970
and visitors if the point is to use - a

00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:03,030
extra cost and this may the cleanest

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,930
in the top athlete or answer against

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:11,850
under system certain conditions so we

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:14,610
are giving like the people in research a

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,770
type of plausible deniability of the

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,620
presence if they use who did not use

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:23,550
this attract the idea this technique is

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,130
called randomization is a technique we

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,460
use it along the sixties in the ideas

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,520
that people could not answer questions

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,520
honestly without being like held

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,160
accountable without being like suffer

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,410
some kind of prejudice at that time so

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,450
they developed this mechanism to give

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,600
people at their plausible deniability by

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,850
you know the coin flip and it works very

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,000
good if you have many examples they

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,470
still allows you to the curve the

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,570
underlying statistics so you can get the

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,710
mean can get the percentage of users say

00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,300
it was one but we do not use and every

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,270
other information statistical

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:08,850
information that you like to collect but

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,770
let's put this type of sensitive

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,110
questions aside we don't care very much

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,630
about that you want address collective

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,510
release data because it's important for

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,130
you because you have partner you have to

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,590
share this information with Department

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,600
or you have like a third party that

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,090
provides you a service and you want to

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,850
just get the result or you want to share

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,930
through some research example like the

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,880
applications are many and what could

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,630
happen is the first thing that you will

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,520
do will be like remove names and Social

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,280
Security numbers but there's a few

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,210
things that you need to take other than

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,990
this the attributes that they're coming

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,080
was identifiers and they are bytes of

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,889
not unique many people may have them but

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,289
the idea is that when you actually

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,289
they can't give enough information to

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:06,530
identify a person here for example we

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:08,770
have 87 percent of the US population can

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:13,819
be uniquely identifiable by zip code

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:17,270
agenda and they have worked with these

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:19,719
three information we can get all we can

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,539
data file in person in a database and

00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:27,110
just get a bit more tricky when we joint

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:30,349
database we can get all the information

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:36,950
of a person's life issues I think a

00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:39,469
little bit so here we have posited files

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,659
as Asian country in heinousness that

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,550
they're gonna hide in this attribute we

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,950
don't want to let people know the salary

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,519
of this other people and what we will do

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:52,100
is we will like their deepest

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,180
identifiers and the country into general

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:59,540
groups so we'll make people fit in

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,820
groups and we have people more than one

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,890
people we move through so we cannot

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:10,160
point the people directly in a database

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:14,029
and the idea is that we create groups

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,910
with people that share the same was

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:20,000
identified so you cannot just point one

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,640
person by looking at the table we can do

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,610
this by using generalization that is we

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,399
will just carry out an attribute and we

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,470
were like change the granularity of the

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,300
information we can do this by

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,250
suppressing information but the

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,180
information that we take their lives so

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:42,040
much information there's still problem

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:46,180
that is linked attacks that we can make

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,310
to other future data may appear and then

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,720
you have a premise which there was like

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,670
an issue like this with

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,940
like super surprises you can see

00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:00,690
people's like contact and they made by

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,700
thinking while I was doing my activity

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,810
but I have a very similar as I pulled a

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,430
spy twist

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,190
you know what I talked about it just a

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:11,160
little bit in Brazil we have a big

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:14,450
company called view and they just

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,250
release a dataset that was analyzed and

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,560
in big salad is they decide to like the

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:24,060
government and everything that aside

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,160
make it public and then some journalists

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,920
were able to identify like two or three

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,230
persons in the dataset by linking the

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,170
data that was public with data of

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,690
concerts or something like that there's

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:40,590
a link and you can see it's actually how

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,970
they did but the idea is that even

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,960
though you think they were not a miser

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,150
there you can just like the at some

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,980
point some other data may appear and

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,980
people may be able to draw connections

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:58,440
between building that's why you have to

00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:00,210
be real careful with release there's a

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,040
few appointments of care not even in

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,900
order to like protect against these

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:10,020
types of attack but they are all not

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:12,270
perfect and I like to at this point that

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,520
you always have this trade-off between

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:19,140
private specials of UTS usability

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,110
against practice you cannot minimize

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,760
data and remain useful so this would

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:31,329
always be like risk staying English

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:34,610
you are releasing datasets discipline

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,040
also has four examples of applications

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:40,820
they use Kennedy one more example is

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,740
they have have a paypal solution I leave

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,260
the links here saying each hacker

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,449
how it happens and how it's the

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,920
implementation and I also have a secret

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:53,630
permutation in check that they do

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,300
another situation that always talk is

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,639
you don't care much about releasing data

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,029
you have a data set but I want to make

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,880
generalizations overpopulation how could

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:07,310
you do that sometimes is important you

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:12,320
want to know if you are product from the

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:15,500
Bingaman know like which where your

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:20,019
clients are liking the most want to make

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:23,240
my general concepts over your layers how

00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:25,370
in a private manner because you remember

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,060
that we discussed we cannot allow people

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,880
to do a statistics data because we can

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,540
still date information

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:39,490
mmm the idea is like how can we do how

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,620
can we make like consults datasets and

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,990
there's a lot of people that talk about

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,569
definitions of - there's a lot of people

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,860
that say a lot of different things but

00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:54,500
wonderfully genetic wear suits well or

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,269
our situation here is this one that

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,149
Primus is pretty much an agreement

00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:02,480
between data holder in a data structure

00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:05,510
and demon is pretty much that the owner

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,660
of the data will not be affected well I

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,819
mean the data to be used the critical

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,000
part is no matter what other stories

00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:16,100
data sites for information sources I are

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,990
favorable so this is kind of critical

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,000
because before we will number them

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,980
concern about older information

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,660
appearing in people being able to do

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,330
like links between

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,640
the information insufficient company

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,290
says this is important because we all

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,120
have something that we protect you

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,200
against this for their information they

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,560
may appear in the context of a database

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,500
what is it is that you were doing is

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,560
building a site yeah if you remove one

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,790
person one dataset the result of your

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,200
query will clearly not change then the

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,460
premise of the presence will be

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,880
protected so an attacker is not able to

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,270
know if he's doing who is on a dataset

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,520
with your data were without this this

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,010
gives you this gives us a kind of

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,040
possible liability of the presence in

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,800
the databases partly the name of

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,020
technique the state this is called as

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,770
friendship virus is a technique from

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:23,780
2006 and is the formal definition of

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:27,380
Travis and I need to show you the

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,270
equation there it is that you can learn

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,660
about the teaches in the underlying

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,760
information without learning about the

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,810
actions of individual people in a

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:42,020
database it does that by adding some

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,430
kind of noise interviewee to protect for

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,010
differentiate axel

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,370
Eddie don't know is this kind of ran us

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,620
over like a random mechanism is kind of

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,870
the critical part here I'm going to show

00:14:51,620 --> 00:15:00,200
you the formula now burn me with this

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:02,840
here the idea is there we have actor on

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,460
the left and term just means that we

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,040
have one biggest fan can we have a

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:11,120
protocol that does is in a dataset and

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,080
this queries just have private results

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,720
and on the right is there I also have a

00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,480
data set but it's only different by one

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,080
and I have another protocol that the

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,750
sphere is a gives me practice the ideas

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,220
that discuss this

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:34,340
they refer by erased natural power which

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,100
is a very small so we are doing queries

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:40,700
of data set they are like pretty much

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:45,020
the same and this epsilon firewall is

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:47,960
true because it allow us to like to demo

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,570
of practice that we want for project so

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,120
we have a way to measure the traffic

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,250
laws that we have went to in previous it

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,130
we have a way to define up privacy

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,850
budget which is like critical for many

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,860
projects so I'm a defined above a set or

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,020
certain level I'm making too much

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,900
privacy and will not be safe in me to

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,360
all our people to do on the state of

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,310
this and another interesting thing about

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,870
this technique is that we have like many

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,480
open-source implementations

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:22,810
they are like pretty much amazing I will

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:26,510
like recommend you to check that a nice

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:29,330
application of technique is most user

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,870
motion I was developed by Apple and

00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,320
frankly will have a smiling crying face

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:38,320
as the most visibly

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,270
second place is for temptation and

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,010
techniques they will be like your best

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,280
friends when you have like regular

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:49,400
applications integral how to promise to

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,430
users but I'd like to remind you that if

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,100
you are using data from you will be

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,080
assistance bound by a few regulation

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,540
there's a few more things they need to

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:04,160
comply with so you need slightly put

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,920
data do all the same the same thoughts

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,920
the the population of might ask you to

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,050
use so stay out stealing to develop on

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,270
the preparation done these techniques

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,990
will help you but you still gonna need

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,990
like

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:25,950
okay another situation there let's talk

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,830
about it has like some linear prediction

00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:31,470
on it we talked a little bit about my

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:35,870
regular business models but we have like

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:39,210
new business models that like rely on my

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,610
prediction models and artificial

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,070
intelligence and machine learning how

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:48,540
can you do that by showing users friends

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,870
what is there for publications just so

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:56,340
easy like getting to the moon is when

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:58,920
you you type something with keyboard and

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,220
it tries to predict where you type in so

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,350
this is pretty complicated things like

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,570
mobile phones and then we use pretty

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:10,200
much every day and mobile phones they

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:14,670
kind of get we kind of have all our life

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:18,930
in it how can we assure privacy in this

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:24,750
context so it is therefore being

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:27,030
completely 100% like put money in

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,820
people's phones what you do is that you

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,090
build your model and you then share this

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,250
model with many clients and your clients

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,350
they use this model is in they can

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,750
interact with this model and they be

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,480
changing customize this model locally

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:47,910
and at some point they will have a new

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:52,860
model and when you have do your amount

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:54,510
of good models for different people in

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,490
the room then I'm gonna make these

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,860
models without ever seeing the customers

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,740
information in general the mother is

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,770
sent back to the users techniques color

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:09,750
fidelity money and it is their mobile

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:12,210
phones they can like cooperatively

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,580
build prediction of others while keeping

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,980
the training data on device so you've

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,830
never

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,110
and customers there to the club and this

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,970
was a technique developed by boots on

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,340
them sneaking they say a lot of things

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,280
they say that it gives you inspire

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:32,330
mother's love our legacy and a lot of

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,210
good things that there's a few tools

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,370
that you can do this on patent and they

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,580
are all amazing tools I have tested a

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:43,549
few of that and I have left you a link

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,880
with some implementation is a check a

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:50,299
check just the sequence and for how to

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,690
use regularly and said like quote a

00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:57,650
client and they do is a get in then send

00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:02,000
the results back back back to you okay

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:04,580
this a problem and if you will like some

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,580
person in the area you may have no

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:10,130
problem and is that you can still infer

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,669
information by the diff between the

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:16,100
models the first knows like the modern

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:19,669
sense you any knows the model he

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,530
receives East you can like infer some

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,900
type of private behavior from the user

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,330
and get some type of private information

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,299
so this technique by itself does not

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,450
actually private but it's a good way for

00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:34,100
you to start and it should be used with

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:38,120
other techniques your it versatile

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:41,630
practice well you still want to update

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:46,220
in model with users data and user data

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:48,950
might be like many users and still it's

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,510
a critical part for your business models

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,760
like handy you later

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,590
they do with data of a lot of people it

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,169
is this critical line for hospitals

00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,120
because they can just legally

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,580
hand over the information to other

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,160
hospitals were the same thing for

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,919
intelligence agents how still they can

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,169
like cooperate without like sharing

00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,970
private information this is a critical

00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,429
point

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,859
the way that we do this is down the

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:17,859
trader protocol they allow users to

00:21:21,999 --> 00:22:32,299
sources of data without in this and then

00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,889
we'll say the rates of everyone and the

00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,830
advantage of this technique is that

00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:40,369
everyone would know the average but no

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:42,200
won't be able to tell which one was the

00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:46,099
scenario of the previous person the next

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,830
person or anything like that so the

00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:52,009
neighbors technique is called a secure

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,950
Munakata computation it's amazing when

00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:58,539
you have little you'll have beautiful

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,539
people building

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:06,190
the model without the need of a church

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:08,559
center party no party learns any other

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,320
participles still that's very cool and

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,900
the only thing that the person is the

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,390
people for thinking like infirm is what

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,940
you be inferred from the output and this

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,909
usually used with other techniques this

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,250
technique TB is joining with today they

00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:28,539
learn it was more privacy to be the

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:34,090
processing of it's like updating too

00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:36,610
many models for mobile phones and there

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,630
is also like amazing tools for you to do

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:42,039
that I have left some examples here and

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:47,650
there's this one limitation here they

00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:49,630
can check that they the last night's

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:53,169
internet situation may I'd like to talk

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,330
about is that sometimes you can't you

00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:57,520
don't have it all just you are the only

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:01,030
of the data but you can't no no your

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,799
data in the process your machine will

00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:09,220
you keep processing the cloud because is

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:11,679
not safe because you just how can you do

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,020
that in a way that you still follow the

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,720
laws to follow the regulation but still

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,610
get the results that you need

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,809
there's a technique that you know house

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:27,240
to some types of computations

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:31,510
cyberattacks so you can obtain results

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:35,260
in this results can be decrypted with

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:38,650
the owner of the secret key so is good

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,299
for the user because it just gives me

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:48,630
the security that is the fire and I give

00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:48,630
you the for some kind of processing step

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,720
make sure that I'm spinning it because

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:57,010
it's encrypted and the results that the

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,480
third party sends me will not be like

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,540
the top part will not understand the

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,280
results because they will also be only

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,020
mean with the secret key it would be

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,270
able to decrypt it

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,309
this one is also good for the temple

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,500
because let's assume they have that

00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:16,669
prediction model that is like amazing

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,690
top notch and like very innovated and

00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:23,090
you want to protect your data so would

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,520
maybe other people would be able to

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,700
train and use the resolution without

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:33,820
ever seeing the inner behaviors of the

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:38,480
bottom or stealing a secret sauce or the

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:41,210
is calling encryption and good when our

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,980
model has a single because the idea is

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:50,809
that data is never been corrupted

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:53,929
outside the users environment allows you

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:56,500
can get encrypted results the only you

00:25:53,929 --> 00:26:02,600
the owner of the secret key is able to

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:06,500
decrypt technique is also saying right

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:13,370
not a dignified fine but secure against

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:15,280
quantum computers this will be like the

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:18,890
technique that we all that gives us

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,760
Primus were present private processing

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,350
the data in the future can I say that in

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,250
the future because we're still a long

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:31,460
way from production use pretty much

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:34,790
because data this type of processing

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,370
works best with interviews and initially

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,940
it still like pretty slow so there's a

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,770
few scaling issues if you do a smaller

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,750
they don't maybe okay but if you have a

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,460
big amount there you may be very

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,299
different

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,250
you to use distended so a resume of what

00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:53,649
we have discussed today we have talked

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,020
about randomization to collect sensitive

00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:59,049
information I can only mean to release

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:01,630
data set but be careful with this racial

00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:06,490
privacy to do aggregations in concept

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:08,799
pretty much to privacy data knowledge by

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,770
director learning is your own Upali

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,570
computation fluid or like create

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:17,980
prediction models and machine learning

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:21,130
models using data for science and all of

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,190
the encryption that allows you to make

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,929
operations over input the data and this

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,000
technique may be like the way those

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:30,909
solve privacy issues in the future but

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,770
not yet there's a few things that I

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:35,919
which have it's fun to talk about

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:40,870
and I encourage you to like search for

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,880
this and give it a lot to and as our to

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:46,000
leave you with a few takeaways the first

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,330
one is if you do meet data of European

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,330
citizens please get a lawyer

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:56,649
see if you comply or not or why is the

00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,649
small things of the law they need to

00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:01,779
comply with remember net data cannot be

00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:03,429
fully localized everything useful you

00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:06,720
always need to think about this

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:09,880
trade-off between Travis in usability

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,309
three years of a life of over large data

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,809
sets of not protected so in doing

00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:19,149
statistics also it's not safe because

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,700
you can like pick the questions together

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:24,640
in private information

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,909
remember linkage attacks that is what

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:34,770
people can get enjoying with another

00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:34,770
information just for information

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:43,150
please check the check this when you are

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:45,280
really Smithers and that's it thank you

00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:49,450
if you have any questions please email

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:52,270
me comments and feedbacks please send it

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:55,440
to me and that's it was very nice to

00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,440
