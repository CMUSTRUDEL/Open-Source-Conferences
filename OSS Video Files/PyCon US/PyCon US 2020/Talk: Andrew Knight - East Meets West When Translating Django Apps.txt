你好！我是软件工程师。

Please, someone translate! Thankfully, it’s easy to do in Django for both new apps and existing ones. We’ll cover language detection, URL routing, translation files, and marking strings to translate (particularly overlooked areas). As a bonus, we’ll also look at translating the Django admin site! We’ll use Mandarin for examples, but the techniques will work for any language.
