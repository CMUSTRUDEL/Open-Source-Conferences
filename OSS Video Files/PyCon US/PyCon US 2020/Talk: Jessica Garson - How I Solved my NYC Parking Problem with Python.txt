Since I have a car in New York City, my car is subject to the city’s alternate side of the street parking regulations. This means most nights I need to move my car before the early morning street cleaning that happens in my neighborhood. I had developed a nightly routine around moving my car before I go to sleep. I am sometimes a bit too good at this and I often move my car on days I don’t need to. Since alternate side of the street parking is often canceled on days where there are holidays, or bad weather, there is a Twitter handle @NYCASP, which posts daily and whenever there is an emergency situation. I used Python, Twilio and the Twitter API to solve this problem for myself so I get a text message whenever I don’t need to move my car.
