Title: Talk: Shauna Gordon-McKeon - Organizing To Improve Your Workplace: Know Your Rights
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Shauna Gordon-McKeon

If there’s a problem with your code, you can file a bug report. But what do you do when there’s a problem with your workplace?

All workers, including tech workers, have the right to try and improve our workplaces. This talk will give you an overview of your rights, with a special focus on issues that commonly arise in the tech industry, such as workplace harassment, overuse of non-disclosure agreements and forced arbitration clauses, and misclassification of contractors. We’ll also talk about what you can do when your company does something unethical, following the “Bargaining for the Common Good” model used by workers around the country to fight poverty, systemic racism, and climate change.

hi everyone thanks for coming to my

00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,349
PyCon talk I got

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,419
real packed room here it's me and my cat

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,099
my name is Shawna Gordon McCann and I

00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,530
have been a member of the Python

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,379
community for about 10 years now this

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,739
had been my eighth Python I think I've

00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:41,870
been AI am a programmer a project

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,489
manager a community manager and today

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,980
I'm going to be talking to you about

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,260
organizing your workplace so I submitted

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,850
this talk to be how to a chance for you

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,409
to learn about what rights protect you

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,600
as workers and what tools you have

00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,370
available to you when organizing your

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,860
workplace but before I get into the how

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,350
I want to talk about the why why would

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,449
tech workers organize why would type

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,460
workers need a union don't we have it

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,979
good enough already you've probably

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,119
heard the sentiment expressed before

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,880
maybe you've even thought it yourself

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,380
and it's a valid question I don't know

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,420
about you but for me whenever I think

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,490
about exploit workers being exploited

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,400
one of the images that leaps to mind is

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,340
of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory which

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,619
was a Shirtwaist Factory back in the

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,390
earlier part of the 20th century where

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,710
these two lock their workers inside the

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,079
factory which was bad enough on a

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,060
regular day but one day a fire broke out

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,530
and hundreds of people died they

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,560
couldn't get out of the building some of

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,700
them died jumping from the higher floors

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,030
another image that sometimes leaps to

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,189
mind for me is the Ludlow massacre which

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,069
is where coal companies called out the

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,350
Colorado National Guard who fired into a

00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:50,600
camp of striking workers killing dozens

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,149
including some of the children of the

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,579
striking workers or maybe maybe I think

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,759
about the many mining accidents and

00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:01,939
disasters have been or the black lung

00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,460
that coal mining companies exposed their

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,979
workers to and of course this isn't just

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,720
a problem of the past millions of people

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,910
around the globe today are experiencing

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,709
forced labor or labor exploitation and

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,410
they face violent retribution for any

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,370
organizing that they might undertake and

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,959
so you're probably thinking attack

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,850
workers have it pretty easily compared

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,069
to this don'twe of like our employer is

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,240
hardly ever kill us shouldn't we just

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:29,090
kind of shut up and be grateful and I

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,100
have three responses to that first just

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,959
because a greater harm exists in the

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,180
world or existed at some other point in

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,760
time doesn't mean that a given problem

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,060
isn't

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,209
real and harmful and worth addressing

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,700
second

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,439
it was workers than labor activists who

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,689
fought and sometimes gave their lives in

00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,909
these battles that gave us the rights on

00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,560
the precedent that we have today and we

00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,329
honor their memory is by exercising

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,390
those rights and following those

00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,730
traditions not by ignoring them

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,590
third when we address lesser harms

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,959
proactively we prevent them from

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,879
spiraling integrator harms and we also

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,010
build the relationships and the skills

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,290
and the strength to address any greater

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,269
harms that come up in the future but

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,280
this is all kind of abstract and would

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,409
apply to any relatively well-off worker

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,269
and modern society so I want to talk

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,230
about why tech workers specifically

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,260
might want to organize so for all the

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,489
talk of tech workers having it good

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,980
there are some problems that routinely

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,989
crop up in our workplaces so as in many

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,790
other industries there's a pay gap

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,230
between what white men make and what

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,090
other people make what people of color

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,340
and what women make for instance one

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,079
report found that in 60% of cases women

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,269
were being offered lower compensation

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,699
for the same roles at the same companies

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,470
in the tech industry black women still

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,019
make 89 cents on the dollar that white

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,090
men do many workers also face

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,739
discrimination on the job one report

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,299
found that 60% of women in tech and

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,129
Silicon Valley experienced sexual

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,919
harassment with two-thirds about

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,840
harassment coming from their superiors

00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,819
one in three reported being afraid of

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,699
their personal safety afraid for their

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,129
personal safety because of work-related

00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,690
circumstances people of color and in

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,959
particular black Latino and Native

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,120
people continue to be drastically under

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,379
represented intact people who color who

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,150
do work and tack face racial

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,030
discrimination from being passed over

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,440
for promotions and to being accosted by

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,260
security guards who don't believe they

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,970
work in the places they work and this is

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,530
just scratching the surface of the many

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,659
different kinds of discrimination and

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,760
harassment that workers in tech face I

00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:31,440
have included some ones to learn more

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,830
about these kinds of things at the end

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,419
of the talk so this varies greatly by

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,940
company but many tech workers are pushed

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,770
to work very long hours one survey found

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,229
that more than half of tech workers work

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,350
over 40 hours a week with nearly 1/5

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,570
working 60 hours a week or more

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,420
I find this overtime issue particularly

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,910
sad because it reminds me of the 1840s

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,230
when the mill girls of Lowell led one of

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,360
the nation's very first strikes

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,480
demanding among other things a 10-hour

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,780
workday and here we are 170 years later

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,650
and we're still fighting for it another

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,970
issue that tack workers are asked is

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,950
that tech worker

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,750
another issue is that tack workers are

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,510
asked to sign non-disclosure agreements

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,070
the nominal reason for NDA is is to

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,900
protect companies from their former or

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,940
current employees disclosing proprietary

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,530
information but this is actually

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,480
protected against via trade secret law

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,040
and so instead India's are actually

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,450
being used to prevent employees from

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,930
discussing problems with the company

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,330
outside of the company so one survey

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,700
found that 15 percent of tech workers

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,700
felt silenced by the NTAs they'd sign

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,540
with workers at Tesla Intel and Amazon

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,830
being the most likely to feel silenced

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,210
another issue is that many tech workers

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,310
when they're hired are pressured to sign

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,720
forced arbitration agreements when you

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,550
sign one of these agreements you

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,830
essentially sign away a right to sue in

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,570
court instead you have to submit to

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,850
arbitration which is a private

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,380
third-party company and it's much more

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,230
likely to find in favorite the employer

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,360
then courts doing forced arbitration

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,310
agreements can apply to you if you're

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,600
suing for sexual harassment or workplace

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,570
discrimination and/or wrongful

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,850
termination many other issues and most

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,770
tech companies require employees to sign

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,940
arbitration agreements although Google

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,890
workers have successfully pressured

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,180
Google into stop doing so which is great

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm gonna talk a little bit more about

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,000
that later on in the talk so more than

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,990
half of workers in the tech industry our

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,080
contractors

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,720
rather than full-time employees for

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,420
instance as of March 2019 Google

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,240
employed 121,000 temps and contractors

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,800
compared with 102 thousand full-time

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,810
employees so more attempts and

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,060
contractors than full-time employees and

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,740
these workers are often misclassified

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,840
this is particularly galling to me

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,320
galling to me however you pronounce that

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,270
it's a problem to me as I am an actual

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,280
independent contractor in that

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,440
I work with clients and they will offer

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,780
me money to achieve certain goals but I

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,820
decide how to meet the goals what hours

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,070
I work when I work what I do what the

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,340
fees are that's what and that's what an

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,540
independent contractor really does

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,280
instead usually Google and these other

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,690
tech companies are misclassifying

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,310
contractors they don't want to have to

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,800
pay their health benefits they don't

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,320
have to give them overtime pay and their

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,540
various other things and typically this

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,550
mistreatment pervades the workplace it's

00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,010
not just like a technical issue of how

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,180
much they're being paid it is part of

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,080
how they're treated at a fundamental

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,000
level so for instance you know some

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,250
contractors their bathroom breaks are

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,230
monitored had facebook they've got like

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,240
tens of thousands of content moderators

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,300
who are contractors and they've been

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,710
developing PTSD from the lack of support

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,830
they get during their exposure to this

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,750
hateful content with the moderating and

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,850
of course like other workers they're

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,350
required to sign NDA's that prevent them

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,590
from sharing the conditions of their

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,410
workplace to the wider world in short

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,690
our employers do what they think they

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,680
can get away with they would do worse to

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,260
us that they thought they could get away

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,850
with worse you can see that on how they

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,560
treat contractors but also now they

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,600
treat other kinds of employees a

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,130
full-time software developer at Amazon

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,560
is treated very differently than a

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,880
warehouse worker who's paid like $15 an

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,980
hour and has their bathroom breaks

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,360
monitored and in areas of the tech

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,520
industry with greater numbers of workers

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,080
such as the game industry workers are

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,970
treated more poorly because companies

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
know that if one worker quits due to the

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,550
way they're being treated it'll be

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,920
easier to find someone to take their

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,750
place the game industry is famous for

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,360
its crunch culture with workers

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,130
regularly pushed to work 50 70 even a

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,800
hundred hour weeks often without

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,630
overtime pay the only thing that

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,400
separates well-paid tech workers from

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,460
exploited tech workers and exploited

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,980
other workers is supply and demand right

00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,050
now our skills are in short supply but

00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,790
it won't be that way forever and then

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,000
the problems we face will grow much

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,000
worse

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,019
while there are a number of problems in

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,660
our workplaces they're not the only

00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:57,040
reason that we might decide to organize

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,689
the work we do has an impact on the

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,970
world around us and we have some

00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:03,160
responsibility for that impact we can't

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,870
just say oh that's the bosses decision

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,910
that's the CEOs decision that's not on

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,160
me because it's our labor and our

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,949
efforts that make the bosses decisions

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,209
come true that carry it out and so when

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,149
they decide to do something that hurts

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:18,939
others for the sake of profit that's on

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,100
us as well but we're not helpless the

00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:23,379
flipside of responsibility is power as

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,329
spider-man likes to remind us and we

00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,680
have the power to change things and we

00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:29,529
have some great role models in this

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,470
regard America's teachers have pioneered

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,529
are among those who pioneered these of

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,089
organizing for the common good so when

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,309
Seattle schoolteachers went on strike in

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,740
2015 for instance they didn't just win

00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:43,420
things like raises they also demanded in

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,850
one guaranteed recess for all their

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,410
students as well as they got a committee

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,509
to look into disciplinary measures that

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,870
were being disproportionately impactful

00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:55,300
on minority students in Chicago teachers

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,040
demanded a nurse in every school as well

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,199
as staff hired specifically to help

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,179
students who were homeless or at risk of

00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,410
being homeless and it's not just

00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,089
teachers who are putting themselves out

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,189
there for their community's bank workers

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,920
have come together to push Wells Fargo

00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:11,470
to stop tying employee pay to the use of

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,939
predatory lending techniques and just a

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,439
few weeks ago workers in General

00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:16,480
Electric started organizing to get the

00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:19,829
company to use their idle factories to

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,389
create vital life-saving ventilators

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,420
what kind of changes could tech workers

00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:27,399
make if we organized for the common good

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,050
well there are so many issues in the

00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,610
tech industry that I couldn't could not

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,870
possibly list them all here but I just

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,129
want to go over like some of the big

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,360
ones and the ones that really stood out

00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:39,339
for me many tech companies have adopted

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,290
business models that require them to

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,120
aggressively violate the privacy of

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,740
their users or even people who aren't

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,620
their users but who interact with their

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,540
users they gather data with limited or

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,999
no consent and then sometimes they offer

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,559
it up to third parties and Facebook is

00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:57,240
the obvious big name here but they're

00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,240
not the only company that's doing this

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,059
some companies are actively working on

00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,679
applying tools of

00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,289
balance and monitoring to oppressed

00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,779
communities Amazon's ring has partnered

00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:11,399
with hundreds of police forces across

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,049
the country to provide surveillance data

00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,849
on communities and given the

00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,979
disproportionate policing of communities

00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:19,259
of color and the disproportionate use of

00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:21,179
police brutality towards communities of

00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,409
color I think it's not a leap to say

00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:28,349
that Amazon is contributing directly to

00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:29,999
violent systemic racism then of course

00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:31,529
this company is like Palantir who are

00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:34,439
working directly with agencies like ice

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:36,089
and CBP to track down seize and deport

00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,969
immigrants and separate their families

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,439
just your you know reminder that there

00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:43,619
have been multiple deaths the immigrants

00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:46,859
and CBP custody including the deaths of

00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,479
at least half a dozen children the big

00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,709
social media platforms have long had

00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,389
problems with hate speech and

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,179
misinformation that they've hesitated to

00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:56,609
address in possibly the worst case

00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,439
Facebook lettuce platform used to fan

00:11:56,609 --> 00:12:01,829
the flames of a genocide in Myanmar

00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:03,449
where over 25,000 Rohingya Muslims were

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,759
killed and more than half-a-million

00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:07,319
forced to flee their homes Facebook

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,059
refused to ban the groups that were

00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:12,179
carrying out this genocide from the

00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,589
facebook for more than a year this is

00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,969
you know this is one of the worst case

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,159
probably the worst case of social media

00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:19,559
being used to incite violence and hatred

00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,299
but it is hardly the only one and it

00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,919
will keep being a problem unless we do

00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:27,209
something social media platforms have

00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,339
also contributed to the rise of

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,899
misinformation both by failing to

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,329
address misinformation being spread on

00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,369
their platforms and also by starving the

00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,889
news industry of income so that it's

00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:40,049
harder to generate trut news from

00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:41,519
trusted sources Facebook has been

00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,649
particularly at fault here has it

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,659
swallowed a huge percent of journalism

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,189
revenue as well as lying to newspaper

00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,669
outlets about the reach they'd have on

00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:51,929
Facebook do things like video and

00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,399
finally I would be remiss if I didn't

00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:55,019
mention the way that many tech companies

00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,509
are failing to protect their workers

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,309
from exposure to Cove at 19 this is

00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:02,759
largely an issue for tech companies that

00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:05,009
have workers that are contract with or

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,429
employee essential workers so Amazon

00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:10,169
instacart lyft uber these workers are

00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,429
getting sick and dying while the

00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,909
companies that pay them fail to protect

00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:16,199
them from the virus and sometimes

00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:16,470
they're not even communicating when

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,320
there

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,750
risk now Amazon and instacart workers

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,180
are going on strike and I urge tech

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,400
workers to step up and support them with

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,410
our resources or money in our voices be

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,260
aware though that stepping up does have

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,420
some risks to tech workers at Amazon

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,890
Emily Cunningham and Marin Costa were

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,620
fired just within the last couple of

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,600
weeks for offering to match donations to

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,130
striking warehouse workers and for

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,910
tweeting that Amazon needed to do more

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,910
to protect them

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,550
okay so hopefully at this point I have

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,770
convinced you that tap workers ought to

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,020
organize so let's switch gears to

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,090
talking about how what tools and

00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,460
traditions exist what laws and

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,770
regulations protect us let me start off

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,410
by clarifying your right to organize is

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,150
not limited to forming a union union

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,160
organizing is just one kind of what's

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,650
called a protected concerted activity

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,720
our protected concerted activity is any

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,400
activity undertaken by two or more

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,440
employees to improve the terms and

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,910
conditions of their employment so this

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,920
is a right that all of us have across

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,170
the u.s. regardless of state laws

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,490
surrounding organizing and regardless of

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,340
anything you signed with your employer

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,840
if you and one or more other co-workers

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,000
discuss or take action to improve your

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,530
workplace your employer cannot fire you

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,790
for it although of course they could

00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,490
pretend that they were firing you for

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,650
some other reason so you might have seen

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,150
the case recently of Chris smalls the

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,800
Amazon warehouse worker who was fired

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,410
after leading a strike demanding

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,260
protections from Amazon against hope in

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,030
19 exposure so Amazon claims that they

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,100
fired smalls because he violated social

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:53,010
distancing guidelines and whether or not

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,060
he did this is not just to defend

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,190
themselves in the court of public

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,230
opinion it is it would be illegal for

00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,520
them to fire him for leaving a strike so

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,560
they have to come up with some other

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,040
pretext like no matter what they would

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,690
be saying there was some other reason

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,520
another high-profile example of a

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,500
protected concerted activity is the

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,350
Google walkout so for those who don't

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,630
remember back in 2018 over 20,000 Google

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,250
workers walked out to protest the way

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,990
that Google had handled sexual

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:24,240
harassment cases as well as some other

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:25,620
grievances and it's really exciting but

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,790
you don't need to have 20,000 other

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,830
people to be part of a concerted

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,490
activity you just need one other person

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,590
a side note here is that whistleblowing

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,970
is not always a concern of activity

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,010
because whistleblowing can be done by an

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,170
individual acting alone but nevertheless

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,780
if you are a whistleblower you are

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,610
protected by separate laws any

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,710
individual just closing information

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,350
which they reasonably believe evidences

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,790
a violation of the law a gross waste of

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,500
funds or abuse of authority or a

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,100
substantial danger to health and public

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,080
safety is protected from retaliation but

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,120
let's say that you do specifically want

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,920
to form a union how would you go about

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,370
it what is like involved in forming a

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,090
union really step zero is reach out to

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,500
union an existing union or organizer who

00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,440
can give you advice about going through

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,290
this process but then step one is

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,850
talking to your co-workers so if you

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,990
want to form our union there's a chance

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,640
that there's something about your

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,890
workplace or the impact of your work on

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,050
the world that is bothering you

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,330
so talk to your co-workers and see if

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,700
anything is bothering them what are the

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,650
common grievances that you all seem to

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,300
have not everyone I sound exactly the

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,920
same grievances but you want to focus on

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,990
the things that there's consensus about

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,210
and everyone's worried about and

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,860
everyone's concerned about most people

00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,810
try to keep things secret from their

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,730
employer at this stage while your

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,780
activity is legally protected as soon as

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,270
you start talking to another person

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,310
often it's not worth the risk of your

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,110
employer being tipped off early because

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,360
they will proactively try to stop you

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,790
and the earlier they find out the more

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,280
advanced warning they get so step two is

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,130
building an organizing committee when

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,120
you're talking to workers other workers

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,070
some will be interested in working with

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,050
uniforming Union and together you can

00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,490
create an organizing committee the

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,770
committee should eventually grow to be

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,660
about 10 percent of the workforce this

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,180
level of participation is both just a

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,650
good sign for support for the Union in

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,970
general but it also helps your

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,010
organizing committee to be more

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,650
representative of workers as a whole

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,330
rather than you know the small like

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,970
clique that's not really accountable to

00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,430
all of the workers the next step is

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,200
generating majority support once you've

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,480
got a strong organizing committee it's

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,370
time to go public and your goal now is

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,660
to get majority support so that you can

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,650
win a union election during this phase

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,840
employers will likely begin an

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,070
anti-union effort if this is if they

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,560
haven't found out about the work before

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,510
so they may do things like hold captive

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,130
audience meetings and that's when

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,350
workers are forced to sit and listen to

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,390
the boss talk about why the Union would

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,680
be terrible for them they might get

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,150
supervisors or up

00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,220
management that's particularly well

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,110
liked to speak out against the Union and

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,510
that may or may not be the well-liked

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,490
person's actual opinion they may be

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,590
pressured into doing it they'll often

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,110
hire out union-busting firms to carry

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,880
these tactics out employers spend about

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,760
three hundred and forty million dollars

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,650
annually on union avoidance and in over

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,170
forty percent of union elections they

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,870
are charged with violating labor law so

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,330
they will fight there's other things

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,550
they might do like illegal retaliation

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,090
and we'll get to retaliation in just a

00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:31,800
minute so because employers anti-union

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,590
efforts will likely convince some of

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,720
your work co-workers to vote against the

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,760
Union whether that's through genuinely

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,850
changing their minds are just scaring

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,770
them but because the anti-union efforts

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,030
will appeal by some support you actually

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,530
want to get to more than majority

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,900
support before you move into the next

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,990
step so many unions will advise getting

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,340
to about 60 or 65% support but once you

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,670
get there it's time for step four

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,170
holding an election so as you generate

00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,910
support for your union you're going to

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,580
be circulating something called a union

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,190
authorization card when an employee

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,180
signs a card though they're signalling

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,640
that they're interested in being

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,320
represented by a union once enough

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,910
people have signed these cards they'll

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,860
be submitted to the relevant government

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,140
agency usually the National Labor

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,810
Relations Board your employer should

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,050
never see these cards or know who signed

00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,880
them at this point the employer may

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,160
choose to forego an election and just

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,570
recognize the union if that's so they'll

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,190
do something that's called card check

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,950
and that's when a mutually agreed-upon

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,600
third party goes through and checks each

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,100
authorization card and make sure it's an

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,960
eccentric signature and that the person

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,170
who signed it really does want a union

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,120
if a majority of workers cards are

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,830
authenticated through this process then

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,670
the union is acknowledged and you have a

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,650
union yay more often in most cases the

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,490
employer will require a election to take

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,810
place before they recognize the union

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,000
election election will be held via a

00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,830
secret ballot either at the job site or

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,020
through them now and if the Union wins

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:04,710
the majority then the employer is forced

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:07,350
by law to recognize them the final step

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,550
is negotiating a contract the union will

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,070
elect are a point

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,650
bargaining community who negotiate a

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,540
contract with the employer but in order

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,910
for that contract to be adopted the

00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,610
union members all of them must ratify it

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,280
the majority vote via secret ballot

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,410
no one not the union not the employer

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,270
will know how an individual individual

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,490
member voted on ratification of the

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,780
contract if the union members don't

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,940
ratify the contract if there's not

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,440
majority support the Union and the

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,450
employer returned to the bargaining

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,210
table and this repeats as many times as

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,520
necessary for until there's a contract

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,520
that the majority of workers sign so the

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,890
Union never forces a contract on its

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,890
members the members must ratify it

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,890
one of the biggest concerns when workers

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,970
are organizing is employer retaliation

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,950
employers are not legally allowed to

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,960
retaliate against us for participating

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,150
in constructive activity concerted

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,400
activity whether that's organizing a

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,200
union or circulating a petition or just

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,610
getting together with a co-worker over

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,400
coffee to complain about how much you

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,960
hate the open office floor plan but not

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,610
legally allowed to do it and not

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,880
actually doing it are two separate

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,830
things kick starter fired to the main

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,310
organizers of kick starter united and

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,440
google has fired demoted changed the

00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:29,370
rules of several of the organizers of

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,900
the google walkout so google and kick

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,490
starter on these other companies i may

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,990
have been betting may be betting that

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,870
they can get away with a legal

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,880
retaliation the labor disputes are

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,550
settled by the National Labor Relations

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,450
Board which is a five-person board

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,360
appointed by the President and confirmed

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,770
by the Senate as you can imagine what

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
the Republican Senate and with Trump as

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,040
president the board has become very

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,260
conservative and so companies may be

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,960
right that they can get away with these

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,930
illegal behaviors and that the NLRB will

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,980
not will turn a blind eye to it however

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,240
all is not lost

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,340
there are things that we can do to

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,990
protect against retaliation some of

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,730
which go back to a time before the NLRB

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,610
existed and before these other

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,980
protections existed we can donate it to

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,300
a fund to help protect people who are

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,820
struggling financially after being

00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,470
retaliated against we can create a

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,750
network to help people get hired in new

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,820
places oftentimes some people are

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,100
retaliated against their sort of

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,450
reputation suffers they'll have negative

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,160
performance reviews or get back

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,290
blackballed from promotions so we can

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,510
take care to lift these people up give

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,930
them new opportunities help them keep

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,420
their profile in the community and just

00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:40,470
generally offering them emotional social

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,940
legal financial logistical support the

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,030
most important thing we can do though is

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,560
to build strength in numbers in 2017

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,330
there was a wave of strikes in schools

00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,860
across the country teachers in nine

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,960
different states walked out of their

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,730
classrooms and most of these were

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,040
illegal strikes because in many states

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,410
it is illegal to strike as a public

00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,210
employee and so any one of these

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,010
teachers could have been fired but you

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,700
know they weren't because what are you

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,420
going to do if I

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,460
20,000 teachers so the reason tech

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,110
workers are paid so well on average is

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,910
because there is a greater demand for

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,460
the work that we do on them people who

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,740
can supply it not because what we do is

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,360
so important to society and not because

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,420
our bosses really like us and want us to

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,030
be happy it's because they need us and

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,980
that means that we have power we can

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,310
protect against retaliation by coming

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,850
together and larger numbers I reached

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:34,320
out to a friend recently to participate

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,450
in a solidarity action and he was

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,700
hesitant because he said I've always

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,100
seen myself as more of an executive than

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,810
a worker and I want to take a moment to

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,210
unpack that because I don't think it's

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,670
that unusual Tech has a very specific

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,160
kind of culture and many people with a

00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,110
specific kind of self-image are drawn

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,000
into that culture and I count myself as

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,970
one of these people I like thinking of

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,010
myself as independent and ambitious and

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:03,500
creative and someone who works

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:06,870
autonomously and has like control and

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:10,230
direction over the things that I do but

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:13,200
I wonder why we see unions as more

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,210
restrictive than companies with a union

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,460
we have a real say in what gets decided

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,410
we elect our union leadership and our

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,960
union representatives and we vote to

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,120
ratify bargaining agreements with our

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,530
employers we have no say whatsoever we

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,560
don't have any independence we just you

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,620
know whatever they say goes

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,690
so why does the dictatorship essentially

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,240
have a traditional corporate form feel

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,850
less restrictive than the democracy of a

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,350
union is it because the power structures

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,510
of the traditional corporate form are so

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,330
normal to us and so common to us that

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,880
they've become invisible other friends

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,710
have said to me look I just want to work

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,650
at work I don't want to bring politics

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,870
into it it reminds me actually of the

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,130
single responsibility principle for

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,050
those of you who don't know this is the

00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,940
idea that each part of a codebase each

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,560
module or class should have

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,020
responsibility for a single piece of

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,520
functionality and all of the logic for

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,290
it should be encapsulated within that

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,330
class so that the class doesn't have to

00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,980
worry about anything else that any other

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,410
classes doing just you know what's going

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,780
on in its own space and that's a

00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,090
seductive idea that you could

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,760
back to people but people don't work

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,540
like that and frankly software seldom

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,310
works like that

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,990
how many projects do you know that

00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,450
actually successfully encapsulate

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:30,020
functionality within individual classes

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,570
most don't most are full of leaky

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,340
abstractions and a leaky abstraction is

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,920
when you think that you've hidden all of

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,540
the messy stuff behind a nice abstract

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,790
clean interface but then you go ahead

00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,030
and use it in the real world and all of

00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,920
the complications just leak out so you

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,500
may think my single responsibility as a

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,140
worker is to come in and do my job to

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,020
write code or write documentation or

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,420
fixed appointments or whatever but that

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,430
abstraction is going to leak your work

00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,140
might violate someone's privacy or

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,600
discriminate against someone for their

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,690
race or even facilitate a genocide and

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,510
that's your responsibility too or rather

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,280
it's our responsibility because we're

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,710
building these tools together and so

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,790
it's on us to come together to fix the

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:19,910
problems with them so let's talk about

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,590
some successes just in 2020 alone two

00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,290
tech companies have voted to unionize

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,240
Kickstarter and Glitch Kickstarter was

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,280
significantly more reluctant than glitch

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,200
find they fired two of the workers that

00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,940
were involved in organizing but they

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,150
were unsuccessful in stopping their

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,580
union and their workers voted 46 to 37

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:41,090
to form a union so congratulations

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,950
Kickstarter on your union yeah glitch on

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,230
the other hand voluntarily recognized

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,570
its union when over 90 percent of

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,940
employees indicated that they wanted one

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,030
so glitch also has a union now and again

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,980
congratulations to the workers at glitch

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,960
another victory was won last fall when

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,210
workers at HCL Technologies which is a

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,950
Google contractor in Pittsburgh voted to

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:05,510
join a union Congrats to HCl workers

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,970
there's also been organizing successes

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:10,100
outside of union efforts so in response

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,170
to the Cova 19 pandemic Amazon warehouse

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,090
workers in Chicago Sacramento and New

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,490
York City a group called Amazonians

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,290
United pressured Amazon and to finally

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,700
granting all Emma's on workers paid time

00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,690
off

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,640
obviously that alone is not enough to

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,040
protect workers and the struggle is

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,980
ongoing but it shows what games can be

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,169
won if worker

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,150
come together imagine what we could all

00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:33,240
accomplish if we joined with them as

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,470
tech workers one other victory which I

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,510
mentioned back at the beginning of my

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,679
talk is that many tech company is for

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,809
cert employees to agree to bargaining

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,490
arbitration when they're hired and a

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,169
group called Google is for ending forced

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,000
arbitration which arose out of the

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,190
Google walkout pushed Google to end

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,020
forced arbitration and after a lot of

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,790
pressure they agreed they actually

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,320
agreed specifically to end it for sexual

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,520
harassment and discrimination claims and

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,990
then the Google is brand-new for

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,870
advertisement like no that's not enough

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,540
and eventually Google caved and agreed

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,250
to end it for everything so for this is

00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,510
for people employed by Google as well as

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,049
contractors that are directly employed

00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,370
by Google but it doesn't currently cover

00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:11,340
people who contract with companies that

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,140
Google contracts with like the so that's

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,700
not everyone that's covered so there's

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,350
still a ways to go but it's a big

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,850
victory and there's even a bill that's

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,309
passed in the house called the forced

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,630
arbitration injustice repeal Act which

00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,820
would prohibit first arbitration from

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,530
being required in contracts nationwide

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,740
which would be a huge victory

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,450
obviously we're not going to get too far

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,070
with the current makeup of Congress but

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,130
that's also something to get excited

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:38,250
about and was as being really being

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,169
pushed by tech workers so these are just

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,120
some successes of the last year or so

00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:44,400
there's so much more happening every day

00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,890
that you can be a part of so how do you

00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,299
learn more and get involved so the final

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,160
thing I want to share with all of you is

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,340
a list of resources and organizations

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,260
for you to look into so first off unions

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,340
there are a lot of different unions and

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,630
I'm just going to name the ones that

00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,100
have been working most actively with

00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,010
tech workers but that doesn't mean you

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,559
shouldn't reach out to other ones unions

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,580
are on your side and even if you're not

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,809
sure whether you actually want to

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,580
organize a union you're not sure what

00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:09,510
kind of organizing you want to do maybe

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,510
I'm not sure if you want to do

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,679
organizing at all still reach out

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,630
obviously they think unions are a great

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,510
strategy but they're not going to push

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,910
you into anything so anyway one of the

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,340
unions that has been most active in tech

00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,140
is CWA the Communications Workers of

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,000
America they have something called the

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,100
code initiative the campaign to organize

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,200
digital employees and they helped glitch

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,580
form their Union and they've been

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,530
helping workers all over the tech and

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,659
games industry great people in bottles

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,140
reach out to them another union that's

00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,690
been working

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,310
Tech is the United Steelworkers so

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,010
they're the workers sorry though the

00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:45,890
union that organized the workers at HCL

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,270
the dual contractor in Pittsburgh

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,680
there's also the office of the

00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,500
professional employee is internationally

00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,980
an ope IU which helped Kickstarter for

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,930
in their union one organization that is

00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,710
not a union that I do highly recommend

00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:03,660
checking out is co-worker org they are a

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,370
digital platform or a group that has a

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,900
digital platform that helps workers

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,970
connect with each other and they back

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,770
that up with an amazing staff of trained

00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,480
organizers who can talk you through your

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,280
options and support you and your

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,860
co-workers as you decide what you want

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,510
to do next there are also a number of

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,150
tech worker organizations that you can

00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,220
join or reach out to there is the tech

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,930
workers coalition which is an informal

00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,640
organization with about 15 active

00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,800
chapters across the globe the majority

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,350
of which are in the US I helped organize

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,720
the DC local of TWC so if you're in the

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,810
DMV area please reach out about getting

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,000
involved with us there's game workers

00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,520
unite which is for workers in the game

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,110
industry I know less about them because

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,340
I am NOT a game worker but I've met a

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,590
number of people involved and they're

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,590
wonderful so you should join if you're a

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,180
game worker there are also a number of

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,400
groups that are specific to individual

00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,230
companies such as Googlers for Human

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,270
Rights and Microsoft workers for good

00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,130
and workers for workers which is an

00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,630
organization that's building solidarity

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,960
between Facebook's full-time employees

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,790
and its contractors here I'm going to

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,200
put up a slide here's a slide which is a

00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,330
list of all of the orgs that I could

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,040
find but I probably missed some so if

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,530
you work in a specific tech company

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,630
I recommend like explicitly looking for

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,990
groups like this pad that are in your

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:21,210
company finally I've got whole list of

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,310
talks and articles about organizing in

00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,380
tech and organizing in general that you

00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,770
might want to check out I put them all

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,320
again on a slide for you and I'd say

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,150
well not it in the broader sense but

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,160
that's it for my talk I hope that you

00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,510
found it helpful and if you've got any

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,980
questions you want to be connected to

00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,630
some of the people or organizations that

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,780
I've talked about please feel free to

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,640
reach out to me personally one of the

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,140
things that I love about the Python

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,600
community is the way that we support

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,580
each other I love coming to Python

00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,200
seeing the spanish-language track and

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,960
the pronoun ribbons on the conference

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,000
badges and the real-time transcription

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,040
of the talks and the meetups for the

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,830
newcomers and the pi ladies auction to

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,750
support women in Python I love going to

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,970
the Python talks that address the mental

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,440
health and depression and anxiety that

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,870
talk about racial and economic

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,250
inequality in our communities and the

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,190
importance of valuing all different

00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:16,140
kinds of work and contributions and it's

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,870
in that spirit of PyCon that I have

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,250
written this talk i I see supporting

00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,410
each other to address problems in our

00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,110
workplaces as yet another way to support

00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,970
each other because healthy communities

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,800
and healthy workplaces help us flourish

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,480
as individuals and when we are

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,700
flourishing as individuals we can give

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,240
back to our communities we don't have to

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,490
be stuck in a endless cycle of fear and

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,040
helplessness and apathy and selfishness

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:47,310
we can be part of something so much

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:49,530
better and I think we will be I almost

00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,030
forgot to record this final section so I

00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,910
thought that instead of doing a Q&A

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,470
because we can't do a Q&A because this

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,140
is not live I'm just recording this talk

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,210
I do kind of a reverse Q&A where I ask

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,140
questions so I wouldn't find a couple of

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,150
people who've been involved in

00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,040
organizing in tech and I ask them some

00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,460
questions and they came up with some

00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:11,610
interesting answers so I hope you enjoy

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:15,780
okay so first s I'm Clarissa Redwine I

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:18,780
helped organize Kickstarter United the

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:22,590
way that I got involved in the Union

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:26,670
effort at Kickstarter was the way that

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:28,290
everyone got involved which is a simple

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,250
conversation with a co-worker

00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:35,160
so Taylor Moore one of the early

00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:38,010
organizers of Kickstarter United called

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:42,060
me up one day I was in San Francisco he

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:45,180
was in New York and we started talking

00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,800
about the things that we had experienced

00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,730
in our time at Kickstarter we'd both

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:54,090
been there for quite a few years and we

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:57,990
talked about recent events there was a

00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,879
moment where our team challenged a

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:04,049
decision made by manage

00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:06,779
and we won we fought for our community's

00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:08,940
values and we won but management

00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,799
retaliated against some of the people

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,819
who had been most vocal in that

00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:15,089
collective action

00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:16,980
so we talked on the phone about how it

00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:20,609
would be great if we had a structure

00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:23,549
that could protect against that kind of

00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:26,669
action taken by management and just how

00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:30,809
how much knowledge and how much energy

00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:34,289
our co-workers have to help a better

00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:37,919
Kickstarter and strengthen the community

00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:39,690
in the platform so I think I probably

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,319
told Taylor like I need to think about

00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:47,519
this but I do remember the next day

00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:50,429
texting him I'm in so that's how I got

00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,659
involved someone approached me we had a

00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,799
conversation about our working

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:59,369
conditions and ultimately I decided to

00:34:55,799 --> 00:35:04,109
trust my fellow coworkers yeah so that's

00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:08,609
how I got involved I did end up joining

00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:10,019
the outreach effort so within the Union

00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:13,410
effort we had different working groups

00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,779
there was like a communications working

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,220
group

00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,799
there was also an outreach working group

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:24,509
and I sort of had a hand in a couple

00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:26,609
different groups and for outreach it's

00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:29,700
very simple we would walk around the

00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:33,119
block or go get coffee and I would talk

00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,670
to my co-workers about their experience

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,730
at Kickstarter so far their experience

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:42,809
maybe at other companies and we would

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:46,380
just get to know each other and usually

00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:49,650
a co-worker would have an idea for how

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:53,099
to improve Kickstarter or to improve our

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,960
working conditions and eventually the

00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,650
idea of a union would come up in these

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,349
conversations and and it was very

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,500
interesting to see how people reacted

00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:09,690
when the idea of a union was brought up

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:12,390
and funny enough some people some people

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,440
at first when they heard the idea of the

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:18,180
Union

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:21,440
like a union would create a relationship

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:25,500
with their managers that they were not

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,260
they were not prepared for so one thing

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,839
that I love about my colleagues is they

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:34,530
they did trust management and leadership

00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,970
and we did work with a lot of people in

00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,599
leadership everyday it's a very small

00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,450
company maybe a hundred people but when

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,890
it comes to recognizing the inherent

00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:48,810
power imbalance in those relationships

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:51,869
some people just didn't want to come to

00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:56,130
terms with how much power our managers

00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:58,260
had over our careers and lives and that

00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,359
was very difficult organizing around

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,740
because you you definitely don't want to

00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:07,020
come off as as you know reeling against

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:11,010
a manager that has a pretty good

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,900
relationship with with your coworker if

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,079
that's not going to help them understand

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,099
that building worker power is going to

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,770
help them

00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,900
it really just pushes them away from the

00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,880
union effort so we we spent a lot of

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,579
time sort of explaining to our

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,700
colleagues that yes you may enjoy your

00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:32,160
relationship with your manager but it's

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,349
very important that we have a contract

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,890
and protections so that if anything

00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:41,490
changes you understand the terms that

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:43,560
you're that you're working under so that

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,329
took quite a few conversations with

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,819
people and some people never came around

00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:53,150
and some people did which was really

00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:56,550
exciting to see some some other people

00:37:53,150 --> 00:38:00,510
were kind of confused about what a union

00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:03,690
could do and what a union what are the

00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:06,960
limits of a unionized workforce some

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:09,599
people thought that that you know why

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,180
should we organize we have free avocados

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,569
in the kitchen we have an amazing

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,690
rooftop garden and and having a

00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:21,329
conversation around what happens when

00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,040
you stand up against a decision that

00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:25,790
your manager makes you know we've seen

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,390
in the past that there's retaliation

00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:30,539
what happens

00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,579
when you experience sexual harassment

00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:35,279
and the company mismanages it which

00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,470
we've seen before it was more talking

00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:40,230
about what are the unknowns that we want

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,720
to be prepared for as a community within

00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,279
Kickstarter so oh you know what I think

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,200
I skipped over what was the hardest part

00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:51,480
of of approaching other people so one of

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,940
the hardest parts of approaching

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,150
co-workers and talking about the union

00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,130
is one you have to be very careful when

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,220
you're unionizing to make sure that you

00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,109
you build trust with the other person

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,339
you get to know them first you know what

00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:09,589
their issues are what they're interested

00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:12,650
in and you have to make sure that

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:14,549
they're not gonna run to management

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,920
management everything you just talked

00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:20,849
about and you also have to make sure

00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,160
that you're building the idea of joining

00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:25,829
a union along with building the idea of

00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,130
having power and agency in your

00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:30,839
workplace it's not just about pushing

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,720
back against management it's about

00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,559
working with management to create a

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:40,430
better working environment in a way

00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:43,319
where the power structures are healthier

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:51,029
so that was something that um that was a

00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:55,079
bit hard to explain yeah let's see um oh

00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:58,140
gosh so I I definitely joined the Union

00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,180
effort out of solidarity I was part of a

00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,900
team at Kickstarter the design and

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,480
Technology outreach team that team

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,869
within Kickstarter was usually pretty

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,029
safe when it came to like organizational

00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:17,160
shake ups or restructuring or layoffs

00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:19,500
usually that team was intact through all

00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,559
of those changes through Kickstarter's

00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:26,759
history so I did feel like I was in a

00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:28,920
place of like I was safer and then other

00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:33,230
employees and other teams that had

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:37,619
historically been treated a little less

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:40,079
less than vital so I thought that I

00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,809
could I could potentially lend

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,229
my little bit of power to the collective

00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:47,789
and together we would be stronger and

00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:50,489
that's one of the reasons that I decided

00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:54,479
to be one of the more public faces of

00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:57,630
the Union because I thought I was jacked

00:40:54,479 --> 00:41:07,049
more safe which didn't turn out to be

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:12,900
the case but yeah so um let's see yeah

00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:17,539
so my my hope for building the Union was

00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:21,450
to basically lend power and and

00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:23,940
decision-making ability to other teams

00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:27,690
at Kickstarter who usually didn't have

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:30,029
the ability to push back against

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,759
management decisions and that's pretty

00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:35,849
much the only thing that I had in mind

00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:37,259
when I joined was you know if I can if I

00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:42,359
can make it a little bit easier for

00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:44,069
someone else then why not and then soon

00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,109
after organizing while I was having

00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:47,969
outreach conversations I discovered that

00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:51,089
I was making 10 percent less than my

00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:54,599
male counterpart in his salary

00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:56,670
transparency swap and I started to

00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,579
realize that a system that takes

00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:02,339
advantage of the person next to me is

00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:04,799
probably taking advantage of me as well

00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,630
which I sort of knew on an intellectual

00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:09,119
level but I didn't feel it in this like

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:13,430
visceral way before until I had to like

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:19,529
gut punch of realizing that I was

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:23,009
experiencing pay inequity so so my hopes

00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:26,609
for the Union turned from supporting

00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:29,489
other people who were in unfair

00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:31,469
situations to also supporting I was

00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:32,940
advocating for myself as well and I

00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:35,400
think that's an important part of

00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,440
organizing is to recognize it yes you're

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,019
fighting for the person next to you but

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,359
you're also fighting for yourself and

00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:47,690
that's that's an important thing and we

00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,690
shouldn't shy it away from voicing that

00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:56,390
let's see um a fear

00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:01,030
when it came to organizing we had a lot

00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:05,869
of fears a lot of people were afraid to

00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:07,550
be the internally public in any way or

00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:09,470
be associated with the union efforts

00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:13,720
because they knew that there was a good

00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:19,840
chance that management would retaliate

00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:23,119
we were also afraid that that this would

00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:26,990
set us back if if we couldn't organize

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,230
or if management decided to fire or push

00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:33,770
out a lot of people in the Union we were

00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:35,720
afraid that we would you know not be

00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,600
able to make it to a vote or if we made

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,570
it to a vote and lost we would have to

00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,369
wait another year to organize and a year

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:47,630
in tech there's a lot of turnover that

00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:49,880
happens that year so so racing against

00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:54,170
the clock was a big issue and a big fear

00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:57,140
for people one of the biggest fears that

00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,570
we should have had but then we did not

00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,460
have at the beginning we didn't really

00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,740
think that Kickstarter's management

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:08,630
would be as anti-union as they as they

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:11,660
were we thought that if we brought the

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:13,880
idea of recognizing a union to

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,300
Kickstarter's leadership that they would

00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:20,510
be excited to be part of this this the

00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:23,030
forefront of ethical tech and they would

00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:27,619
be excited to live there public benefit

00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:31,940
corporation values and support us as poe

00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:36,740
workers and it was a big surprise that

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:40,340
they they did everything in the book to

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,420
to be anti-union so that was a big

00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:45,140
surprise and we should have been more

00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:48,290
fearful of that than we were and that's

00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:53,300
a big part of plain sight yeah so even

00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:56,600
if your company you know displays values

00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,510
that you agree with and is forward

00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,010
thinking and and caring about their

00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,320
community the community that they serve

00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,530
it doesn't necessarily mean that they're

00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,220
going to be able to break out of their

00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:10,390
incentive structures that

00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:14,150
keep unfair working conditions in place

00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:17,570
yeah and oh gosh the kind of support

00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:20,450
that I think we could have used so we

00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:24,590
got support from all different kinds of

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:28,390
people so people who had built unions in

00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:33,109
the past people who maybe were part of

00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:36,619
tech organizing efforts you know in in

00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:40,220
other ways but one thing that we could

00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:42,580
have used is more inoculation when it

00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,680
came to protecting our core organizers

00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:48,800
we we as organizers did a pretty good

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,200
job of inoculating our coworkers

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,710
but I don't think we did a great job of

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,990
setting ourselves up so that we were

00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,820
bulletproof when management came after

00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,340
us partly because we didn't think that

00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:05,840
management would go after us in such a

00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:08,170
blatant way you know I I had exceeded

00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,099
all of my metrics Taylor had also

00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,140
exceeded the metrics that they had given

00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:15,920
him after they put him on a performance

00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:21,140
improvement plan which he didn't I don't

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:23,750
think he deserves and and yeah if we had

00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:26,320
had more instruction at the beginning of

00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:29,930
how to create a paper trail that

00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,260
reinforced our good work that would have

00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:35,390
helped us at the end and maybe even kept

00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:38,839
us from getting fired in the way that we

00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:41,599
were fired yeah so that that might have

00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:43,720
been good proactive support that we

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,790
could have used they sort of how to

00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,830
legally protect yourself as you're

00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:55,490
becoming more and more of a visible

00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:57,230
Union figure yeah I was lucky enough I

00:46:55,490 --> 00:47:00,470
mean a lot along those that thought

00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:02,420
process I was lucky enough to have a lot

00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,190
of documentation about my work and about

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,750
how management was targeting me

00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:10,730
but had me

00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:16,130
the reason that I had so much

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:19,680
documentation is because I was I was

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:23,670
earnestly trying to get help from HR

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:27,390
and my manager and I was saying like hey

00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:29,579
I think this feedback is not appropriate

00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:32,190
I think this is targeting I think this

00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:36,390
is retaliation and what I was actually

00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:39,990
doing was like sharpening you know the

00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:42,990
machine that they were employing to get

00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:45,869
rid of us so so yeah so that

00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:51,800
understanding also like would have been

00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:54,200
good to have like an external HR support

00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,780
maybe from our Union I guess

00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,869
OPA you did a lot of work there to help

00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:03,270
support us and to help us navigate what

00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,280
was happening to us but there were core

00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:09,089
elements of building a wrongful

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,829
termination case that we found out when

00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:13,619
we were actually having our interviews

00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:17,369
with the NLRB it would have been nice to

00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,319
know that you know management must know

00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,609
that you're part of the Union you must

00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,890
prove that you are being treated

00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:24,390
differently from other people and you

00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:27,540
must prove that there were negative

00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:29,700
consequences after management found out

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,010
that you were part of the Union those

00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,109
like core parts of proving your case

00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,589
would have been really nice to know at

00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:39,990
the very start of when we decided to put

00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:41,220
ourselves out there so that kind of

00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,079
support probably would have been helpful

00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,270
but we just really didn't think

00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:50,579
Kickstarter was gonna do that kind of

00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:55,799
thing so yeah so hindsight changed since

00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:58,950
we started organizing well we maybe two

00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:01,950
weeks after we think management became

00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:04,290
aware of the organizing effort through a

00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:07,410
leak we think that about two weeks after

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:09,690
we had an all-hands and something that

00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:12,420
we had asked for for a long time and

00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:15,900
that we were organizing around was an

00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,750
anonymous reporting tool and Kickstarter

00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,520
had the head of HR center and a note

00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,579
saying that they were doing away with

00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:27,660
the anonymous reporting tool and they

00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:30,089
wouldn't be replacing it and several of

00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,400
us sent all add emails asking for it to

00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:33,500
be replaced

00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,799
were turned down every time and this was

00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,180
over the course of maybe six months and

00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:41,270
two weeks after management found out

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:44,630
that staff was talking about unionizing

00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:48,470
they immediately instituted a new

00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:50,809
anonymous reporting tool and they had an

00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:52,849
all-hands where a portion of the

00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:55,549
all-hands is dedicated to financial

00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:58,849
transparency and they talked about how

00:49:55,549 --> 00:50:04,549
they were reworking we got promotions

00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:06,980
and how we had anyway so yeah so it

00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:09,319
became very apparent that management was

00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,660
trying to improve our workplaces pretty

00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:15,049
immediately after they found out that we

00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,089
had been organizing as a group what we

00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:21,020
didn't realize was that this was part of

00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:27,619
a larger strategy to undermine the Union

00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:29,450
and to to basically Union bust we we

00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,819
originally thought oh my gosh what great

00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:34,279
evidence that unionizing and that acting

00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:37,400
is a collective can make positive change

00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:38,900
in our workplace but we probably should

00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:45,170
have seen that as more of an insidious

00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:47,630
act to undermine the Union so and ah the

00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:50,990
vote was so exciting Taylor and I

00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:54,710
actually got to participate in in the

00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:57,890
vote and and we walked right into

00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:00,170
kickstarter HQ cast our vote it was

00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,480
amazing and our fellow organizers

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:06,230
actually swarmed us so that we had this

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,529
buffer of co-workers going into the

00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,029
walls of Kickstarter it was quite

00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:17,089
nerve-wracking at least for me Taylor

00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:21,680
seemed fine and the election was amazing

00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:25,339
and so the first thing that happens

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:28,910
after you win a union is you have a

00:51:25,339 --> 00:51:31,279
meeting with the yes and the no votes

00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:35,630
and when you when you have a union

00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:39,020
election almost everyone votes it's it's

00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:41,299
very it's very unusual for people not to

00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:44,089
vote in a union election there's very

00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:45,060
high turnout so you have this meeting

00:51:44,089 --> 00:51:47,340
where you come to get

00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,670
you're like hey we're a team let's let's

00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:56,010
build this union together so that

00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:58,890
happened a couple of weeks ago or months

00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:02,880
ago now the coronavirus is squashing

00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:04,950
time but so everyone came together in a

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,230
meeting and are talking about what they

00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:10,050
want in their contract and they're

00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:13,170
beginning discussions with Kickstarter's

00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:18,030
management so yeah so that's what's

00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:22,110
happening now and and on the on the NLRB

00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:24,900
front Taylor and I are still waiting for

00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:28,830
our case to be decided it's it's highly

00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:32,340
unusual for a case to have lasted this

00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:35,670
long in the system if there wasn't merit

00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:38,130
to the unlawful termination charge so

00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:41,010
we're just waiting to hear what's

00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:43,200
happening with that and at the same time

00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,760
waiting to see what's going on at

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,480
Kickstarter and see what kind of

00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:51,020
contract they win yeah so that's that's

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,020
