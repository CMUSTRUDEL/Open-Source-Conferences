	Presented by:
Shauna Gordon-McKeon

If there’s a problem with your code, you can file a bug report. But what do you do when there’s a problem with your workplace?

All workers, including tech workers, have the right to try and improve our workplaces. This talk will give you an overview of your rights, with a special focus on issues that commonly arise in the tech industry, such as workplace harassment, overuse of non-disclosure agreements and forced arbitration clauses, and misclassification of contractors. We’ll also talk about what you can do when your company does something unethical, following the “Bargaining for the Common Good” model used by workers around the country to fight poverty, systemic racism, and climate change.
