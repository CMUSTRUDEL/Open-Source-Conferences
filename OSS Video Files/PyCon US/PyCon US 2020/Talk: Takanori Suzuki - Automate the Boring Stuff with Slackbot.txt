Title: Talk: Takanori Suzuki - Automate the Boring Stuff with Slackbot
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Takanori Suzuki

Today, there are many tasks to repeat in the company/community.
In addition, we often use chat such as Slack for daily communication.
So, I created a chatbot(PyCon JP Bot) to automate various boring tasks related to holding PyCon JP.

In this talk, I will first explain how to create a chatbot using slackbot.
I will tell you how to registers botâ€™s integration on Slack and how to create a simple bot in Python that responds to specific keywords.

And as a specific case, I will explain how to make a bot command to perform the following operations and technical problems.
- Emoji reaction
- Block-kit
- Calculator: SymPy
- Karma(plusplus): Peewee
- Search issues, display issue details: JIRA API
- Create multiple issues from a template: JIRA API, Sheets Spreadsheet API
- Search files from Google Drive: Google Drive API
- Account management of G Suite(user, alias, group and member): G Suite API
- etc.

boring stuff it's awkward today I will

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,439
talk about motivation for shock

00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,950
but how to create simple mode how to

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:35,560
create interactivity and how to exit

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,560
spot using libraries and appearance

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,350
happy to give you feedback on twitter

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:49,129

conference of the world which I called

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:25,420
the PI control I present it at nine

00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,420
conferences on the troll mostly in Asia

00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:34,600
this talk could beat the finer point of

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:39,280
the tool so I am deeply moved

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,070
now let's get back to the main topic

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:48,620
first I will talk about the background

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:51,320
and motivation of this talk i how the

00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:56,120
pike on JP event several years in the

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:59,390
past as you can imagine what subtasks to

00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,660
hold conference for example talk

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:08,090
management and skate sales and venue

00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:13,450
management and food and Coheed snacks

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:16,600
and beers we are important for me and

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,170
the number pi koji be stuff is 40 over

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,920
how

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,770
the new stuff new stuff as customer

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:30,830
seems to me and I say the similar

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,730
answers repeatedly on chat but programa

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,690
is resi

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:42,230
as you know programmers dislike would

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:44,300
evoke I also dislike it very much I want

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,140
someone to the Bible dose of dust

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,050
instead of meal like a secretary

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:58,640
ok let's make it because I'm a

00:02:51,050 --> 00:03:02,900
programmer the goal of this talk you run

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,870
how to create simple BOTS and how to

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:10,489
exceed it how to create either people

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,670
and how to exceed it put using power

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:18,019
ivories and API through various case

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:25,250
studies there you'll be able to automate

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:28,910
your boring stuff insert what why is

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:33,500
that what my Secretary's chat about for

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:37,250
slack do you know suck suck is insert

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,120
message platform messaging platform and

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:47,120
I hope suck running all the time on my

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:51,530
PC and smartphone this makes it easy to

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,510
access struck I want to do everything in

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,000
shock

00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:02,750
let's make a chat bot fosroc first I

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,620
will explain simple integration with

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:12,170
incoming web hooks this is system

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:16,430
overview when program send a message to

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:19,370
our web foot URL we are HTTP the message

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:24,129
were sent to suck hard work and

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:29,210
something first

00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:32,020
we won't create internal integration how

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,990
to generate wave wiki's as follows

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,990
generate wave Luke URL step 1

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,210
wait Osaka plication step to enable

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,690
incoming wave hooks in the application

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:51,620
step 3 wait our incoming wave works then

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:52,849
we get very very similar like this great

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,419
on your application

00:04:52,849 --> 00:05:03,110
quit application they setup iPhone this

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:06,020
is my beerbot and enable web hook in the

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,750
enable web hook create a web hook in

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,229
your broad workspace

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,539
at last we got a web hook you are a okay

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:21,440
we have a wave okay all right let's send

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:26,060
a message to suck with it we say the

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,630
simple message with call when we send a

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:36,440
message with Jason the message will be

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:39,919
displayed in shock it's easy but we are

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:45,349
passing it we using you all rip thought

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:48,289
request module make Jason and send this

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:53,830
Jason to you well your tank wicked

00:05:48,289 --> 00:06:01,900
message if you like request is more easy

00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:07,250
URL and theta this post wicked message

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:10,340
and we can send complex message like

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:16,430
this with message attachments this is

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:20,270
mrs. attachment it's rock format the

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,990
data and filter then get shot

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,789
this complex message nice to meet you

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,819
thank you for coming to my talk please

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:34,470
give me feedback about this talk I refer

00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:38,810
expiry and from Java if

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:42,840
need more complex message UK is pocket

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:45,990
pocket is a new UF new where mark on

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:51,200
sock and pocket builder is Intertie

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:54,420
prototype builder this is pocket builder

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,410
you can choose some component and drag

00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:03,300
and drop this field then you get the pro

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:09,270
key to Jason okay this is sample code

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:12,690
for rocket this way you Ari and

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,860
this information there I create a pocket

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:21,180
data

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:27,240
ital and the divider and or press key

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:34,680
false then we send this pocket this is

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:40,160
result of the rocket nice message the

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,160
memories from I got it back on 2019

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:48,900
summary of incoming wave works easy to

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:52,160
send message from programs and create

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:56,220
complex message with attachments and

00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:00,740
voltage but simple integration is one

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:05,460
way only programmed web spoke to suck I

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,930
want an interactive we spot next I will

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:13,160
explain how to create interactive pot

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,160
well suck both library

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:22,350
this is system all of you when I say the

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:25,710
hi message to struck and the podcast

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,460
shock message and circuit respond hi

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:35,310
arms

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:38,550
I'm slack bot this is interactive I'll

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:44,190
describe how to create in Turkey but at

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:48,090
first we create put the users on track

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:51,120
step 1 create a certification

00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:54,570
step two in neighborhoods tip three

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,670
other body user safe for in-store

00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:02,100
application to workspace they're

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:05,430
authorized as a result we get put to

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:10,140
user all stop was access token this

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:14,450
exhaust XP pravara then a trust invite

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,450
both two users to several channels

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:23,970
neighborhoods in your application and

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:27,990
add a bot user and about user and we

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:32,310
install application in your workspace we

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:38,190
get access token a trust invite both the

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:40,710
channels then I will quit my bot program

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,290
whereas with circle driver

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:48,210
jackpot is a chat bot framework or

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:54,690
Python I can use a quad tip insert

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:58,260
support I make p.m. be a man install

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:03,260
circuit rival for my pod project then I

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,260
make simple circuit with only four files

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,260
quite a simple boat

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:14,280
well circuit first circuit settings

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,160
taught to py this API token is a put us

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:23,460
access token and the progress package

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:27,990
name and wait wait 1.5 1.5 main program

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:32,570
for circuit board it's full 1 pi so

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:36,630
simple and we create simple probably

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:39,150
probably the package we create to the

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,810
outer scope and skull on the score in

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:46,760
each route py for package and I create a

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:52,320
subreddit to py file for simple problem

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:58,740
this program catch high $0.10

00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:06,540
hi I am P about this is file structure

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:11,720
only for files so settle down what runs

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:19,140
rock pot pie salt 1 dot py and I said hi

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:22,260
peer about st. hi IRB about I guess you

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:27,329
understood the basic way to mix rockbot

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:30,920
so we were excited each X in the

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:34,950
stockpot decorator

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,730
with the code when the message matching

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,420
the pattern is sent on the channel

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:45,690
respond to is said to support high

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:51,570
recently and she always want to respond

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:54,270
to octave 8 on the mission I said hi

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,780
your God saying higher pray about I said

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,770
Cheers

00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:01,290
but P about not activated but I said

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,110
mention at be about shared be able to

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,060
respond to Cheers

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:13,980
the chance message only what weight

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:16,589
mention if pot mentioned to several uses

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:23,310
you can use message dot to Reaper I'm

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:30,300
isn't what send messages that we pray be

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:30,810
able to measure to me message reaction L

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,500
sorry

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:39,589
emoji reaction with message dot way up

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:44,790
the result he put get peer message

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:47,430
Watson both react via emoji I want to do

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:53,760
a course to be a Pittsburgh and be a

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:57,920
measure and circuit can handle

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,110
parameters we use whether expressions

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:06,270
parentheses it is passed as a parameter

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:08,850
values this is choice command when I say

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:12,510
in the choice pizza peel sushi and was

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,430
is Peter space PS basis Sheen and speed

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,060
and

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:19,850
random choice in the same be about

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:26,650
choice Peter Ami's to see I chose the

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:29,950
sushi the about be about can handle

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:35,960
permit us with me your expressions

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:40,220
this is next example I said number some

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:44,450
numbers with peers be able to react via

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:53,180
icon I said what other bills yeah that

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:56,600
yeah both respond 100 be a emoji circuit

00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:00,920
has several settings well it's a circuit

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:07,510
settings that py aliases a call

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:12,200
important settings if if I said Alice is

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:17,210
prefix is prefix instead of ratio at by

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:23,090
what pink equal therapy I said that I'd

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:30,500
choice fear when sake' HSPA this choice

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:37,760
come on this is more common right so a

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:40,160
quad can use attachment if you if you

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,560
want to use attachments you can create

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:50,150
attach to meditate and chase of dots the

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:57,560
circle can use use broke it broke its

00:14:50,150 --> 00:15:01,550
Jason summary of circuit we can

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,100
communicate with circuit third pod can

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,700
handle parameters in messages with

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:12,290
regular expression so a quad can send

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,010
message in various horns I think you and

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:19,880
the student

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:22,490
can do very sings next case studies I

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,160
will show you some case studies

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,730
combining the Python libraries and API

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,850
switch circuit

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:38,240
case study one calculator function using

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:41,620
simple motivation I feel happy to call a

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,260
calculator application on my smartphone

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,339
it seems useful if struck as a

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,339
calculator for me

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:56,200
simple simple Python library for

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,200
symbolic but buttkiss

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:06,680
if you I can use peepin so simple

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:10,490
this is calculator function calculator

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,890
to PI calculator come on this car could

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:18,620
occupy relation to formula like pattern

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:21,410
je vous is pod kit for Iraq Fatah and

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,890
simply feed formula and the combat

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:27,980
integer body or float body and

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:34,970
responders message this is result I said

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:37,970
1+1 2 I said to spell it for us here as

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:42,130
well 12 squared you have Auto responder

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:48,100
say hundred sixty five hmm it's nice

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:53,620
it's nice for me case study to

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,620
prosperous function using PV or mapa

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:01,610
motivation in Pike on JP stuffs I want

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,040
to make a culture that appreciate each

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:10,040
other stuff thank you for your support

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:13,699
thank you for helping and pee wee pee

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:20,720
way is a small one simple small or Matta

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:26,140
a small expressive or mapa and TV

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,140
supports SQLite masculine and PostgreSQL

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:35,540
this is prosperous modern prosperous

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:40,160
model had two fields name and counter

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:45,200
counter is a techie food and counting

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:51,620
sucks counting and this is prosperous

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:57,950
not to be a comment if the both get some

00:17:51,620 --> 00:18:02,169
was prosperous and get count the

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:06,740
increments and save and change thank you

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:09,679
second name and counter this is result

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,440
as in stop prosperous elfcon 1 stop

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:19,090
progress of council and prosperous

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:24,550
beyond caught one nice next case study

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:30,460
this progeria issue and such issues

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,460
watch facial JIRA is useful

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,380
Piko DP use PyCon GP stuff

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,440
use a JIRA for task management

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,919
generalize issue management system like

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:47,870
us mmm white wine as on our github

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:52,160
issues 0 is very useful but JIRA rib is

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:57,080
very heavy I want to check issue details

00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:02,030
please a job well you know where this is

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:06,080
system overview the user said that issue

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:10,300
and such issues command stockpot get

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:14,290
information or such information for with

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,290
JIRA waste appear

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:24,970
ja peso JIRA is a pasta library to work

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:30,740
with zero api's this is authentication

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:35,390
and Katie she object 0 to issue an issue

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:40,550
ad to get issue information this is

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,929
result I send for it for is issue ID

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:47,929
they get

00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:53,960
information such issues I think some

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:56,749
Chivas and then but such JIRA with

00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,519
jaicro takeaway is a general query

00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:06,289
language this is result I say the taraji

00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:16,639
up icon epic then general response some

00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:20,419
issues with aged 500 Park even next case

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:26,869
study create multiple issues from a

00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:32,529
temperent motivation Pikul GP held a

00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:36,769
pike camp event for all over Japan and

00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:42,460
maybe next couple months and each spike

00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:45,950
up event require 20-plus issues and

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:51,110
before this boat I copying issues by

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:55,369
hand each each by camp event this is so

00:20:51,110 --> 00:21:01,190
painful task for me and JIRA weather is

00:20:55,369 --> 00:21:07,749
a very heavy you know this is system

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:12,590
overview users and create issues command

00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:19,970
Circuit issued temperate information

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:23,119
from Google seeds with seeds API 20 plus

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:26,029
information get then suckwad create

00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:36,879
issue with 0s therapy and create create

00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:41,090
great great great before this API this

00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:43,970
command we want to create a Google

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:47,259
authorization but google also relation

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,240
is complex for me first

00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:55,580
was Google wait Google cloud platform

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,980
project and enable ApS this is English

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,230
Google sheets API and they download

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,590
Queen Azshara JSON file

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:06,050
next install google car driver people

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:11,150
install google api so crowd grows all

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:14,650
those rib and next download a quick

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:18,290
starter to pee right on from github

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:21,530
Google's authentication github

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,510
well QuickStart dot to py and the sake

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,910
to your Google account a web browser

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:31,340
quick access accept button at worst we

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,880
get the token dota picker file this

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,430
token to the picker file this is

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:47,030
important information for was a positive

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:54,620
authorization this code is how to get

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:59,780
the spreadsheet date we see its API then

00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:04,420
get loose its information and this is

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:07,190
quite the ratio with zerah zerah i

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:13,940
equate issue information Reika dict

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:16,790
and 0 dot creator issue this is a sample

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,330
of temperate command there are pi can't

00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:26,600
create command is greater issues for pi

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:30,050
1 pi Kappa event the user centered PI to

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:33,470
PI can create the praise and target to

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:38,150
date and those stuffed names they both

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:42,230
create parent issues and children issues

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:48,710
a trust both gender parity she

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:52,730
URL this is sample temperature category

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:56,810
and assignee and the due date to date is

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,360
a date filter from target date and the

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:03,220
sub-array is a title of issue and the

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:08,450
description is a description of issue

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:12,770
and as you can see I can

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,190
create many tickets for pi cup is one

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,620
come on

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:20,500
this is parents kit and this is

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,500
children's gets I am very happy

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:29,630
so scholar of idea comedies here I never

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:34,510
have to copy issues by again issues

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,510
again yeah

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:44,930
last case study is account management of

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:49,130
GC motivation Pike on JP years a Python

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:53,780
dot - JP domain with G sweet I only use

00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:56,810
Google atom in web occasionally I forgot

00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:01,100
to use admin screen for create a new

00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:07,850
stuff alchemy account the Eco email

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:12,080
address add to group this is system

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:16,760
overview is the send Giada mean come on

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:25,220
to circuits truck what handle this

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:30,800
command on Adam II API to GC but if we

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:33,920
use the new API is gr mean defeat API we

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,940
need to we also engage the Google

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:41,600
authorization update Google Cloud proto

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:45,080
project G sweet add me API and we dowel

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:50,420
rod credentials or to JSON and the women

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:56,720
Quick Start Auto py get new top then get

00:25:50,420 --> 00:26:02,990
new token dot people file okay this is a

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:08,000
get user wrists equator at me API and

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:09,940
service that users risk execute they get

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,790
or user wrist

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:16,400
this is insert user what is a user

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:21,290
information and we use also to insert

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,710
the Creator user on G seat

00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:30,500
suspend suspend user and regime user and

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:33,920
the dairy to user this is a whole G

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,130
admin command G admin command have the

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:41,020
several sub commands this is user

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:45,250
management user is a turret with it a

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:50,330
waste management and group management

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:54,080
group meant by management this is a

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:56,660
sample result of G I mean come on

00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,030
here we use a list is a usual email

00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:05,540
address list and G admin group list ho

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:13,490
group email address and Jeremy member

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:19,340
lists or with some several group I can

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:26,480
copy little for that Google admin this

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:31,400
is source code of German command summary

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:35,090
of this talk you learn how to create

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,720
simple boat with incoming wave works how

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:41,590
to create in Turkey boat with Rockport

00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:50,500
how to extend it circuit with library

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:55,390
80s next step let's make your Oh bot and

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:59,380
wedgie is reverie and fps in your body

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:03,730
then automate your boring stuff with

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:11,000
circuit so you will have more free time

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:12,020
you can do more creative since are you

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,780
at all sorry master

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:17,420
Pittsburgh rewriting I am a soul thank

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,550
you for very much see you next years in

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,670
Pittsburgh

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:25,400
this is trance command on circuit this

00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:30,310
is trance : code where it's Google
