Title: Talk: Matthew Knapp Bachmann - Transitioning from developing software to developing people
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Matthew Knapp Bachmann

Developing your career is building skills to grow the impact you have on an organization. After a certain point engineers typically decide to either go down an individual contributor path or a management one. Recently, I decided to try engineering management. My company had me manage six engineers in a recently formed team. In my first six months as a manager I developed the teamâ€™s process for getting work done, learned the basics of managing career development, and positioned my team within the larger engineering organization. I also learned about balancing competing priorities and moving a diverse set of personalities and desires towards a common goal.
In this talk I intend to talk specifically about the role of a manager of a single team. I will go over the types of problems a manager is responsible for and discuss the value a good manager can bring to a team/organization. I will help attendees understand the perspective of their current manager and help them decide if management is something they would be interested in trying out themselves.

my name is Matt Bachman I'm here to talk

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,420
about transitioning from developing

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,500
software to developing people so a

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,910
little bit about myself

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,400
I joined an organization named Laura

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,140
calm a little under a year ago within

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,239
the first month there so an opportunity

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,590
to come manager came and I jumped on it

00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,259
it's something I've been wanting to do

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,210
for a long time now and I bring that up

00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,589
early in this talk because I need people

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,940
understand this does not talk where I

00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:38,010
bring in years of engineering management

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,199
experience or an encyclopedic knowledge

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,400
of engineering education theory this is

00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:43,199
a talk where I'm going to discuss the

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,430
experience I had transitioning from the

00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,710
individual contributor role to that

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,360
manager role and it's the kind of

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,890
information I wish I fully grok before I

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,879
made the decision it's the kind of

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,589
information I think would be super

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,470
valued to an individual contributor it

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:56,970
was considering becoming a manager and

00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,439
on that note the first thing we need to

00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,360
talk about is that management as they

00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,070
rolled out people you're working as

00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,710
people all day long you're talking with

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,909
people within your team you're talking

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,770
with people outside your team you're

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,360
talking managers to execute business

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,740
goals you're talking to other

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,570
departments to make sure that they're

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,100
getting what they need from you so if

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,900
you don't enjoy working with people

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,850
you're gonna have a hard time in

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,650
management it doesn't mean that you

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,840
can't be an introvert I consider myself

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,940
an introvert in a lot of ways but the

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,220
thing is I enjoy the interactions I have

00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,600
with people if you don't enjoy working

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,370
with people you're gonna have just a

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,300
really hard time being successful as a

00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:35,070
manager and on that note as a manager

00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,900
you're the primary point person for your

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,220
team if anyone has questions about what

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,040
your team works on they're likely coming

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,270
to you if people need things that they

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,409
think your team could be helpful with

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,500
they're gonna probably reach out to you

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,990
first and you really need to have almost

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,940
a customer-service effect you need to be

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,270
able to take people's requests and be

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,670
helpful or informative or just really

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,580
disapproval if you're someone who people

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,110
don't feel good after they talk with you

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,950
they're gonna stop talking with you and

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,049
your team's gonna miss out on

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,220
opportunities or you personally are

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,350
gonna miss information that you wish

00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,899
you'd had you want to be someone that

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,230
people are excited to reach out to

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,330
essentially on a similar but different

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,360
note is as a manager you're a bit of a

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,159
buffer for your team you have extremely

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,579
valuable resource in your engineers

00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,810
they're in given important goals if what

00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,410
they're working on isn't important you

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,520
probably would have

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,710
giving them something else to work on

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,320
and as such you need to make sure that

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,270
they are working on those goals as much

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,420
as possible in that what that means is

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,680
you're taking in underdeveloped ideas

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,300
and make sure they're fully fleshed up

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,070
for the gifts to your team you're taking

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,600
distractions and you're handling them

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,980
before they get to your team you're

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,480
identifying roadblocks and you're

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,720
clearing the throw blocks before they

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,010
become a problem and you know that

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,810
doesn't mean you never bring a team in

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,430
but the idea is if you're distracting

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,870
them from what they're working on you're

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,310
gonna slow down those things and you

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,860
just really want to make sure you're

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,660
doing that as little as possible and

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,220
that's sort of the macro view of

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,100
management as far as the wide

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,170
organization is concerned but as in as a

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,890
manager you're also a bit of a career

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,510
coach for the engineers earlier I said

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,460
your met your individual contributors

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,410
are extremely valuable and that's true

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,680
but you can know it be made more

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,510
valuable and as you're trying to work

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
with them you're trying to coach them on

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,870
their career you're trying to show them

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,070
things that they're doing well and show

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,020
them ways that they can do a little bit

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,600
better because if you're able to do this

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,630
successfully your team will group become

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,370
more valuable over time but ignoring the

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,800
whole idea of like value to the

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,200
organization for just a second the fact

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,790
the matter is if your team doesn't get

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,140
value from working with you or if

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,360
they're not growing in their role

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,830
they're probably gonna realize that they

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,110
can do better elsewhere and either leave

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,209
your team or leave your organization you

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,160
really want to make sure that the people

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,580
on your team feel like they're getting a

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,380
lot out of what they do and so that's

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,200
what primarily one-on-ones are for but

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,640
also a lot of the interactions you have

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,620
day-to-day is making sure that you're

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,580
aligning people with the projects that

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,230
best fit their individual goals so now

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,580
we talked about what management is I

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,200
thought we'd go into some of the reasons

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,970
why management knife might not be the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,650
right call for you if you're getting in

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,270
the management because you see it as a

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,180
promotion or the next rung on a ladder

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,680
you might want to stop for a second

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,930
because you don't need to climb a ladder

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,790
just because you see one when you take

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,560
any promotion this is advice that goes

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,270
beyond the whole transition from

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,010
individual to the manager if you take

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,610
any promotion what you're essentially

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,990
doing is changing the perceived role you

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,350
need to be mindful if that's something

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,640
you really want to do

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,740
because there's actually nothing wrong

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,660
with staying where you're currently at

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,640
for the most part if it's something you

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,780
really enjoy doing and if you look up at

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,430
the next step and you say you know I

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,450
don't really like what goes on there

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,070
then you don't need to take that

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,480
management in particular is not really a

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,680
promotion you're gonna get a lot of

00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,170
people congratulating you for the

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,090
promotion or saying wow it's cool you

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,560
got promoted these I understand that's

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,240
what you're actually doing is changing

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,370
the role that you're working you're

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,760
changing what you do from day to day and

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,290
you need to be mindful about that

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,120
another reason why management may not be

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,550
the right call is if you're getting into

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,470
it because you want power if you're

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,420
frustrated of how your organization's

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,370
going and you see management as a way of

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,540
making changes to that organization I

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:28,530
think you're not entirely wrong you are

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,600
granted some power as a manager you are

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,980
given a team who should be working on

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,360
what you tell them to work on but the

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,600
other day the power your grant as a

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,750
manager is fairly imaginary and your

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,430
primary skill as a manager it's that of

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,890
influence and influence is something you

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,350
can execute on even as an individual

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,760
contributor in fact you'd have to do it

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,930
a lot of individual contributor and if

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,280
you're having trouble influencing

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,780
organization from an individual

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,210
contributor role I think you're going to

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,400
have a lot more problems try and do that

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,320
as a manager because like for example as

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,640
an individual contributor you're one

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,440
writing the code and you have to make a

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,260
whole lot of decisions and as a manager

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,520
yeah you can sort of steer the ship but

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,400
if you're not able to convince the

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,020
people you are managing that the team is

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,520
doing the right thing you're gonna be

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,440
fighting them constantly and you're not

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,900
gonna get anything done and at the same

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,310
time you're gonna have a lot of trouble

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,130
working with people outside of your team

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,930
who you have literally zero power over

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,060
what you have is the ability to

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,770
influence so develop that skill of

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,870
influence as an individual contributor

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,030
and when you're able to influence people

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,830
you take on the title to match and if

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,410
you are ready to work with people then

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,820
take on manager do not become a manager

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,950
for power it is a lie so now we've

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,660
talked about some of the reasons why you

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,040
might not want to consider mansion let's

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,479
talk about some good reasons cuz their

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,860
management things that if they ring true

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,600
for you management might be a good role

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,470
for you first of which is he only be

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,150
motivated and energized by

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,830
the people around you we'll get into

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,930
this a little bit more later but as a

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,230
manager your role is to enable others to

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,930
get things done and you're gonna be have

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,030
to get certain enjoyment of the success

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,540
of the people on your team because

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,860
they're the ones doing the most visible

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,270
things they're the ones building the

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,000
stuff that your team's working on you're

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,500
just enabling them to do it and if

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,480
you're not able to get some motivation

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,160
out of the wider team success you're not

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,960
able to be motivated by the idea of

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,820
helping your team succeed you're gonna

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,520
have a hard time doing this for any

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,900
period of time the next thing is you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,090
need to be comfortable of perspective

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,790
taking it takes I think a high level of

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,110
empathy to be a good manager you're

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,840
gonna be dealing with people all day

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,190
long and if you're not good at empathy

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,380
you're gonna have a hard time dealing to

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,170
people all day long but you're also in a

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,820
lot of conflicts and not necessarily

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,290
fights but you're gonna have a lot of

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,640
competing objectives you're gonna have

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,130
disagreements about how to go about

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,780
things and if you're able to take the

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,090
perspective of other people

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,040
you're more often than not going to be

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,440
able to find positive some solutions or

00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,570
compromises that lead to both parties

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,070
winning out whereas if you are not able

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,590
to see where people are coming from it's

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,880
gonna you have a hard time doing that

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,230
I'm not saying that you can make

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,930
everybody happy I'm not saying that

00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,940
every disagreement will become a

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,160
beautiful solution where everybody wins

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,440
but I'm saying that if you're able to

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,300
look past the disagreement and look

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,400
towards the goals the other people have

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,330
you're more likely to find those

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,430
solutions you really need to enjoy

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,190
thinking about team and organizational

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,729
dynamics take an idea how does it become

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,990
a project not a product but a project

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,830
what are the steps that need to happen

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,669
in order for that idea to be executed on

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,130
working with your team to break that

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,510
project down in the JIRA tickets working

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,890
with other teams and organizations to

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,470
figure out the pendants ease on how to

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:48,260
make sure that this idea can be done

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,150
well and also aligning individual needs

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,770
to organizational objectives this

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,820
actually gets back to the whole empathy

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,910
thing I was talking about a second ago

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,160
where you want to take the needs of the

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,470
organization align that with the needs

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,880
of your team and align that again with

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,490
the needs of the individual contributors

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,380
on your team

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,640
and this gets into that individual

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,110
coaching I was talking about a few

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,550
slides back where you want to make sure

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,930
your team is growing and you want make

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,360
sure the organization's winning and

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,010
wherever possible you want to align

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,870
these things such that your individuals

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,730
getting what they need leads the

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,420
organization getting with it needs which

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,760
leads to the company being successful so

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,680
what changes when you become a manager

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,399
the first thing is code is no longer

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,560
your primary job as I said earlier

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,270
management's about people your being

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,250
that stopgap that's making sure this

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,020
stuff gets to your team only when it's

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,580
fully formed you're the one working with

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,830
the rest of the organization to make

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,839
sure engineering is well represented in

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,120
the company you're the one working with

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,670
the product and design and getting work

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,410
sent to the team that's let's you're not

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,709
gonna be coding all day every day in

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,470
fact you may go to a saccade coding but

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:58,230
I said primary with intent you should

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,560
always have a technical understanding of

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,000
the systems your team works on and early

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,649
on your career I don't think it'd be

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,380
valuable to get rid of coding entirely

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,480
in fact I personally have trouble

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:13,500
imagining a world where I go completely

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,040
away from the code so how do you keep

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,390
your coding edge sharp when you're not

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,850
coding most of the time you should still

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,880
take on projects you should still work

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,380
on features and bugs help debug things

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,110
when production error just happen

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,550
but the key thing is the most important

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,420
thing is that you stay off the critical

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,920
path it's fine to work on a feature but

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,520
it can't be one where if it doesn't get

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,730
done

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,709
your team fails or your teams hurt what

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,200
you need to be doing is identifying

00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:46,170
things you can work on where you can put

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,700
them down when you have to take on some

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,440
organizational tasks the worst thing

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,110
that can happen as a manager after

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,670
spending all your energy making sure the

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,260
team's working effectively is for you to

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,570
have taken on this critical piece of

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,730
functionality just get pulled off of it

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:04,649
for a week and then end up blocking your

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:07,410
team because you have chosen poorly you

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,149
need to understand that you need to be

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,420
focused on the people's stuff first and

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,770
finding projects you can work on

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,209
independently the next thing is success

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,009
becomes a lot fuzzier

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,470
you're no longer able to point to things

00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,689
and say hey I made that at least not as

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,490
often the success that you're going to

00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:26,069
be measured on is the success of your

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,790
team and that can be a fuzzier thing it

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:31,619
can sometimes be hard to clearly

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,269
communicate the value you're adding you

00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:36,869
need to be comfortable with that and

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,559
realize the work you're doing is work

00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:41,759
and is adding value even if it's not

00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,699
immediately obvious by looking at the

00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,259
product I think any engineer has been in

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:47,759
this business long enough knows the

00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,589
difference between a good manager and a

00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,759
bad manager and the value a good manager

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:57,629
brings and you need to get better at

00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,899
identifying that and being able to use

00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,759
that for your own motivation while also

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,959
communicating that value to others the

00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,790
next thing is your calendar it gets a

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,230
lot more complicated this is a

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,990
screenshot of my calendar that I blurred

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:14,490
out as you can see it's pretty full and

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,319
you're no longer in a situation like I

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,089
was before being a manager where I go oh

00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,249
sheesh I have two meetings today

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,720
I've never get anything done you're in a

00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,279
situation where most days they're gonna

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,920
have meetings and some days you're gonna

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,240
have nothing but meetings and you need

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,600
to start thinking about your calendar

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,569
more strategically and I'm gonna go on a

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,329
small digression here the first thing is

00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:37,769
busy is not the same as productive you

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,209
need to have some self-awareness and ask

00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,459
yourself are you being productive are

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,829
you just signaling productivity I want

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,170
to be clear I am guilty of this I am

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,379
often jumping into 100 slot channels

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,350
making noise looking very busy while not

00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:55,559
getting anything that important done and

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,029
I think people need to be self aware of

00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,939
when they're doing which and trying to

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,689
make decisions about being mindful of

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:05,639
what they work on the first thing is

00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:07,040
develop a task management system I like

00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,869
David Allen's getting things done

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,269
however a simple to-do list is fine

00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:15,149
maybe you do Kanban or scrum for

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:17,339
yourself but the point is organize tasks

00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,209
get ideas out of your head and on the

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:23,490
paper or digitally as fast as you can

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:27,029
because your brain is for ideas it's not

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,440
for memory not really and if you don't

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,080
get organized you're gonna

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,210
things you're gonna lose track of what's

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,360
important and what's just immediate so

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:38,850
you need to keep develop a task

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,640
management system and use it the next

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,820
thing is you have a lot of meetings the

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,290
fact but you need to learn that

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,230
participating and leading a meeting is a

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,030
skill you need to develop it but you

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,610
also need to demand people around you

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,990
learn it because a lot of the means

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,830
you're in are not necessarily in your

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:01,290
control so as best you can have

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,580
effective meetings but provide the

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,790
feedback to your organization that

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,410
ineffective meetings are not acceptable

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,250
and whenever possible we shouldn't have

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,890
them so some tips on that meeting should

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,850
have a goals meeting should have action

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,890
items meetings are allowed to end early

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,110
small meetings means as few people or

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,760
for decisions and large meetings are

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,240
more for brainstorming and broadcasting

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,640
ideas and yes sometimes broadcasting

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,990
ideas is better done over email some

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,060
people never read emails and you just

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,050
have to broadcast and sometimes the

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,530
meetings the way you do that

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,880
but like I said earlier you should have

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,920
these things in mind and if you find

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,960
yourself in meetings that don't have a

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,770
goal I don't have action items provide

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:50,820
that feedback push back and as best you

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:53,520
can without being a jerk demand that

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,130
other people have these skills as well

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,970
because they're taking your time and you

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,740
really need to use your time effectively

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,820
because you can easily be driven by a

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,840
counter you have no control over

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,710
otherwise the last thing that changes us

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,870
a lot fuzzier it's a lot harder to

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,770
really explain it but the short version

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,120
is people start to look to you when

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,530
something goes wrong or there's

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,960
something that people don't know you'll

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,790
notice that the room starts to look

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,130
towards you for an answer and you may

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,589
not always have one in fact you almost

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,670
certainly don't have one and you just

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:37,490
need to be ready for that and be willing

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:40,350
to sort of embrace that uncertainty and

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,660
be someone who's able to drive the team

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,380
I'm not saying how

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,480
false bravado I'm not saying lie you can

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,280
say it's okay to say you don't know but

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,210
you just need to be ready to provide

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,730
something when the team looks to you and

00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:57,020
if asking what to do and now I want to

00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,430
talk about something that might be a

00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,720
little bit controversial or at least

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,330
when I've talked to people about it

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,030
again some push back and that's politics

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,500
specifically office politics I think it

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,720
can be a bit of a third rail in an

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,390
engineering organization because I think

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,180
there's this idea that engineers should

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,590
be above politics that the right code is

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,370
the right code and that's what gets done

00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:21,380
and I think this is a fairly naive idea

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,750
if I have any influence at all in this

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,570
talk I want put the idea out there that

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,530
politics is a thing that just needs to

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,300
be understood it's a fact of life and

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,790
the definition of politics I work with

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:39,470
is politics is how groups that people

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,300
collaborate and make decisions so any

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,370
organization you're a part of has to

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,140
make decisions and they have some system

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,330
for making those decisions even if

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:52,040
you're completely hierarchical asst

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:54,620
organization and no bosses you still

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,100
have informal relationships and informal

00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,890
systems that exist to make decisions

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,590
because ultimately you have to make

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,650
calls about what to do and if you want

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:09,860
to have your idea implemented you need

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,020
to work with the system so as a manager

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,150
as anyone really but especially as a

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,120
manager you ignore politics at your

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,980
peril having the right idea doesn't

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,400
matter if you don't know how to get that

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,080
idea through the organization so at this

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,580
point I want to remind you that if you

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,860
become a manager you're are granted a

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:31,730
little bit of power but that power is

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,460
imaginary you are it is your

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,490
responsibility to use what little power

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,390
you have and combine that with an

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,400
understanding of how the organization

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,500
works to get the right things done and

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,210
especially as an early manager

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,660
relationships are critical you can't do

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,610
anything without having strong

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,890
relationships with your team with other

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,640
managers with the rest of the

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,400
organization

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,200
I as a manager would be completely

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,140
worthless if I didn't have a strong

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,630
relationship with my designer my product

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:09,650
manager and the other people on my team

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,690
so a couple things you need to

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,490
understand is your job what are your

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,950
jobs as a manager is to advocate for

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,540
your team but you need to remember that

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,570
the other teams are on your side as well

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,430
you're all on the same team ultimately

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:26,420
trying to build things that the

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,160
organization needs but they're gonna be

00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,510
times when there's projects that no one

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,570
really wants to do and there's some

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,800
jockeying about who ends up doing it and

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,460
your job is to advocate for your team

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,680
and their job is to educate their team

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,510
stress that you need to have a bit of a

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,420
give-and-take you need to help teams out

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,400
when you can and then ask for help when

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,900
you need it or say I can't take on that

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,650
job right now because we're kind of XY

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,450
and Z and you need to keep those

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,060
relationships intact you can't have a

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,260
scorched-earth policy so whenever

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,020
possible look for a collaborative

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,020
solution look for something that makes

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,960
everyone better off and that won't

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,870
always be possible but put the effort in

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,680
because you wanna you want to keep your

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,720
relationship strong so one last topic I

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,890
want to discuss around politics or at

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,190
least some what can generate around

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,560
politics is the idea of team branding

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,780
team branding is really important so

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,580
what you see on the screen here is logos

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,130
and I want to be clear that I wasn't

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,200
responsible for these logos but I love

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,570
them my team actually put these together

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,310
the one on the right was entirely by my

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,020
designer the one on the left was

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,630
actually a collaboration between my

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,770
designer a few my engineers and I was

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,660
even in the situation where I was

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,980
somewhat pushing against a little bit of

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,250
this branding early on because I was

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,290
worried that it wasn't super clear it

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,000
was like very fun but not very clear but

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,550
over time I've learned that I have been

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,490
very wrong so what my team works on is

00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,260
customer support tooling and we call our

00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:02,090
customer support team the Wombats so

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,800
we're the wanjin ears and that's part of

00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,540
the idea of saying a team identity but

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,309
really your goal is to make sure that

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,090
everyone in the organization knows

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:13,100
your team does and what they don't do

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:16,129
because if you don't define that well if

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,679
you don't have a team vision you run the

00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:20,149
risk of having your roadmap dominated by

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,419
other teams declaring you as a

00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:25,279
dependency and this is why sometimes if

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,720
you've ever been in a meeting where your

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,120
managers sitting with the team trying to

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,470
define this it might feel silly at the

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,389
time but what's going on is they're

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,519
trying to establish the boundaries and

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:35,840
what kind of stuff you can lay claim to

00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:39,289
and what kind of stuff you can say

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:43,999
doesn't fit and customer sports is

00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:46,700
actually a very clear case of needing to

00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:50,149
do this because it's very easy to create

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,039
a situation where support needs a thing

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:55,220
therefore your team will build it so an

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:58,090
example is let's say you released a

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,249
feature around two-factor authentication

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:04,269
but you didn't actually build the

00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:07,669
ability to change your phone number and

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,840
suddenly you put together some hack so

00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,429
there's an API to change the phone

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,590
number but it's not in the product yet

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:16,009
so the support uses it when people call

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:18,019
in now suddenly it can be very easy to

00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:19,639
argue that your team owns the phone

00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,139
number feature because without it

00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,440
support engineers can't do their job

00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:25,639
that's a gap in the product changing the

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,980
phone number should be functioning that

00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,950
belongs to the user that support might

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,899
have access to maybe but primarily

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,169
that's a feature that belongs to the

00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:36,200
user

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:38,869
our team builds features that are for

00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,149
the support agent first and supports the

00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:42,830
mission of collecting information to

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:44,570
identify the problem the user of having

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,490
and give the user the information they

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,190
need to solve it and in some cases

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,679
solving it themselves we build tools

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,840
that aid visibility that get agents

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,809
information they need and we build tools

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,619
that are designed for them it is not our

00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:03,529
job to fill and get in the product now

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,649
that being said your team vision should

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:09,320
be somewhat flexible if there's some

00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:11,090
aspect that you want to attack adapting

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,809
your vision to fit that can be

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:17,269
beneficial and also keep in mind give

00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:19,100
and take so now we talk about politics

00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,039
of organization and defining your team

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,210
within that

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,190
and such that people know where you work

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,720
on let's talk about that pipeline of

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,359
selecting projects and ultimately

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,669
executing those projects you don't have

00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,919
that much say and what your team works

00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:34,259
on the product manager often selects

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,570
what features you work on when and the

00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,460
execs often will drop projects on your

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,090
lap saying that you need to get this

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,169
done and that's fine but what you as an

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,019
engineering manager need to be able to

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,580
do is influence that process and make

00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:51,960
sure that your team set up for success

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:56,090
so the way you do that is you have a

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,799
good process and having a strong process

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,279
gives you the tools you need to go

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,679
through those conversations effectively

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:07,320
every team has a process even if that

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,849
process is we wake up we work on

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,820
whatever we feel like working on and if

00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:14,970
we get bored we stop working that's a

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,659
very bad process it's not one that gives

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,129
you very many tools when it comes to

00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:23,099
discussing projects with other parts of

00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:26,190
the business however a process where

00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:29,220
work is estimated that those estimates

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,190
lead to measurements of capacity and you

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,220
go into every sprint or every month or

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,809
every six months even with knowledge of

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,999
how much your team's get done that gives

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:40,999
you a lot of tools in selecting projects

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:47,820
so you as a manager really want to find

00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:50,099
projects that the business values but

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,529
also fit and expand your team skill set

00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,749
so an example where these things can

00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:56,489
come into conflict is a mobile app can

00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:58,259
be super super valuable for the business

00:23:56,489 --> 00:24:00,119
but if you have zero mobile developers

00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,889
you're taking on a lot of risk by taking

00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,879
on that project Wow if you have people

00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:07,379
on your team who are interested in

00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:10,619
mobile development it could be

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,909
beneficial to take on some part of that

00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,029
project such that you can expand your

00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:16,559
team's abilities into mobile but you're

00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:20,369
not taking on a risk that your team

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,899
can't effectively execute on and another

00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,159
reason why you want to expand your team

00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,899
skill set by the way is that you want to

00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,889
keep your team interested in working in

00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:30,659
a sustainable pace but ultimately the

00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:33,630
idea of a process is the work of your

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:35,700
team to estimate tasks

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,690
measure cassadee and get those tests on

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,130
an atomic matter

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:42,780
I spent easily the first four to six

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,520
months of Lola working on my product

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,980
manager working my designer working with

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,660
the rest of the team to define a process

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,820
that works for us and we ultimately

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,600
landed on scrum or at least a former

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,060
scrum where tickets get defined we break

00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,570
those tickets down into parts we

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:03,210
estimate each ticket and then we every

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,310
two weeks or so we whole tickets in

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,660
based on our capacity with the

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:11,490
expectation that we're gonna get this

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,810
things done and now what I have is when

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,640
a new project comes down to the pipe and

00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,890
someone goes this is super important we

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,690
need to jump on this I can say okay so

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,260
my team does supports this I see why

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,570
this is important and to be frank my

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,760
team sent capacity so while I really

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,990
want to work on this if you feel like

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,490
this is important enough let's have a

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,800
discussion about what work needs to come

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:33,360
off the skew here in order to fit it in

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,390
so I would have my team estimate the

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,070
work then we compare that with other

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,780
ticket and say I think if we drop this

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,860
project we can slide this in so which

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,600
one of these two thinks is more

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,820
important to you and that's just an

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,440
example of not taking on work just cuz

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,970
someone says you need to do it but to

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,670
make sure you're taking on things in a

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:54,120
mindful manner the last thing I have to

00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,350
say on process is people are more

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,630
important than process people over

00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,790
process it's not a phrase of mine this

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,290
is a scrum phrase and it's the idea that

00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,360
you need to adapt your process to the

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,910
team you have and not to let the rules

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,580
of the process override the people on

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,680
your team ultimately it's about them so

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,180
if you're interested in learning more

00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,460
about prophecies there's a lot of

00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,770
resources on this you can look at scrum

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,840
you can look at Kanban you can define

00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:22,950
your own process a lot of interesting

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,360
stuff on there so the last thing I want

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,300
to get into today is the concept of a

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,340
reports growth so as a manager you have

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,310
a strong incentive to keep your team

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,870
growing and expanding and I don't

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,000
necessarily mean people I mean the

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,440
engineers on your team should be getting

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,870
more valuable overtime they should be

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,300
expanding their impact over

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,550
and there's a lot of reasons for this

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,320
one it's better for the business if the

00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,480
people they have are more valuable so

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,290
them becoming more valuable over time is

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,960
a win and also your success as a manager

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:57,170
is the team's success like I keep saying

00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,559
your value is indirect you're an enabler

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,450
so if you can't enable your team to have

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,090
a bigger impact your growth is going to

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,010
be limited as well you want to build up

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,390
your engineers but on a personal note

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:13,460
it's also just the right thing to do to

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,200
keep an eye on making sure your

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,270
engineers are getting something out of

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,429
their time at your company you're

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:23,150
somewhat responsible for their careers

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:25,550
not single-handedly responsible but you

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:29,030
can be ethical about this and keep your

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,530
team expanding and making sure that when

00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,690
they leave they look back and go there

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,929
those are good times I'm I learned a lot

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,450
it was valuable of me or you can not

00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:40,880
keep this in mind and ultimately have

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,200
people leave going you know what it just

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,990
didn't get a lot out of that position

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,080
and just I'd feel terrible if people

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:52,550
left my team frustrated and feeling like

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,520
they've wasted their time so carry about

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:57,410
interference growth means balancing the

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,530
needs of the business with the needs of

00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:03,260
that engineer it can not always work

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,910
perfectly sometimes the business is

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,800
gonna win and you're gonna be working on

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,559
things that don't helps a career that

00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,380
much and sometimes you're gonna make

00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:14,809
calls that give your engineer the

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,000
opportunity to grow potentially at the

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,320
cost of the business I typically believe

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,820
that if you trust people to get things

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,580
done they will figure out and get it

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,990
done for example if you have a engineer

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,340
who's really really strong

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,740
you can keep giving them the most

00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,780
important projects but if you keep doing

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,880
that and not don't give other people a

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,980
shot you really run the risk of getting

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,080
overly dependent on that engineer and

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,720
what you really need to do is say you

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,220
know what this might be short-term bad

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,470
for the business to give this project to

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,850
another person but that person's gonna

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,980
get a lot out of it and the business

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,380
will be stronger over time as we have

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,590
more strong engineers on the team and we

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,550
haven't invested all our resources into

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,420
one person who seems to

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:58,910
right when they came in and last thing

00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,260
on that is when you have a really strong

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,450
engineer and you've been giving them all

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,430
the important projects you've run a big

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,170
risk for when they leave leaving your

00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,900
team and the company in a bad position

00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,250
so really put the effort into making

00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,720
sure that you're expanding the horizons

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,820
of the people you work with and you're

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,190
doing your best to divide up those

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,690
responsibilities among everyone and the

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,870
thing about career growth is it's a

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:25,690
partnership ultimately every engineer is

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,860
responsible for their own career growth

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,180
if you're in a job where you don't feel

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,650
like you're getting this is your

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,440
responsibility to find a way to get it

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,450
either by joining a different team or

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,090
leaving the organization or just really

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,720
having a conversation with your manager

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:44,810
so it's not all on you as a mantric salt

00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,550
it's a partnership however it's one

00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,860
where you have a big voice and you

00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:51,470
should be guiding them as best you can

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,030
so this last slide here is just some

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,130
resources that I found valuable that I

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,830
want to share the first is help I have a

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,420
manager by Julia Evans this is a short

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,220
scene from the perspective of an

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,560
individual contributor Shore teaching

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,300
them what a manager does what your

00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,130
relationship with manager should be and

00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,080
how you two can get the most out of each

00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,370
other I found it super valuable when I

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,470
was in the visual contributor and I also

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,260
found it valuable as a manager and that

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,360
it helps me understand what I should be

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,410
doing and also helps me start those

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,090
conversations of ICS next is a mattress

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,070
bath a guide to tech leaders and

00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,250
navigating growth and change with by

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,400
Camille Fournier it's this is probably

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,630
the best book on management I've read I

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,060
really enjoyed it and I also love that

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,410
it grows with you so if you're an

00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,360
individual contributor or even if you

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,730
never go into management I found this to

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,740
be a very interesting book because it

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,930
starts with you as a tech lead then as a

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,360
manager as then as a manager of other

00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,150
managers all the way up to CTO and it's

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,390
just an interesting read cover to cover

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,000
next

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,780
I suggest marco rogers as a twitter

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,970
follower

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,770
i this thread in particular at length i

00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,950
found very very interesting as it talks

00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:04,460
about what the needs of a business and

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:07,320
the needs of being a thoughtful and

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,120
caring leader can be sometimes out of

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,750
sync and how stressful that can be and

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,880
it was a very eye-opening thread and

00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,220
finally I have asked a manager I there

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,600
just a general the interesting blog

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,160
about management not necessarily

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,770
technical manager but management in

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,960
general and they have a lot of good

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,530
advice interesting stories and with that

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,830
I'm done so thank you for staying and

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,830
talk to you later

00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,360
