Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Lorena Mesa, Elaine Wong, Mariatta

9 years ago an initial group of 7 women met at PyCon USA 2011 began the world of what we know today as PyLadies. Since 2011, PyLadies has grown to 100+ chapters worldwide and the growth doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon! What has made PyLadies so successful in the past - it’s decentralization and high degree of chapter autonomy - has presented PyLadies with unseen new challenges in 2020 such as burnout, resource stagnation, and ultimately not allowed PyLadies to respond to the global community of 2020.

Join regional PyLadies organizers as they present what PyLadies has in store for the future including a global vision for community engagement and open source projects open to all.
