Title: Talk: Lorena Mesa, Elaine Wong, Mariatta - 9 Years of PyLadies: Lessons Learned and What Comes Next
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Lorena Mesa, Elaine Wong, Mariatta

9 years ago an initial group of 7 women met at PyCon USA 2011 began the world of what we know today as PyLadies. Since 2011, PyLadies has grown to 100+ chapters worldwide and the growth doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon! What has made PyLadies so successful in the past - it’s decentralization and high degree of chapter autonomy - has presented PyLadies with unseen new challenges in 2020 such as burnout, resource stagnation, and ultimately not allowed PyLadies to respond to the global community of 2020.

Join regional PyLadies organizers as they present what PyLadies has in store for the future including a global vision for community engagement and open source projects open to all.

all righty hi everybody my name is

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,760
Elaine

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,310
and long with maryada we're here to

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,890
present virtually on 9 years of PI

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:32,180
ladies lessons learned and what comes

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:35,790
next we're gonna go to the next slide so

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,949
awesome so here's all our contact info

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,910
we are from various PI ladies chapters

00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:41,820
from around the world

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm hail from the great city of Toronto

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,129
in Canada maryadas from pilotis

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:52,949
Vancouver and Loretta is in Pylea

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:54,900
Chicago so just to start on origin

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,080
stories like how did we all get started

00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:01,229
so for me this all started when I

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,750
decided to graduate from school and I'm

00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:07,040
a full blown journalist with the

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,190
Canadian public broadcaster the CBC and

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,369
yep

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,500
yep who knew that once you graduate from

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,080
journalism school you become a tiny

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,780
unicorn with cute little headphones and

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,430
a microphone so as a journalist I was

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,260
always trying to improve my skills and

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,810
kind of see what the next big thing was

00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,210
and we're back in the day when I

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,660
graduated in 2010 there was something

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,070
called computer-assisted reporting and

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,900
from there I discovered this magical

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,650
language called Python was really good

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,530
at parsing languages it kind of helped

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,570
me like scrape some data and build upon

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,600
these like investigative skills that I

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,260
wanted to get super strong on and I was

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,900
like wow this is amazing but weird I

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,100
went to J school like no one really

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,290
knows what programming is so where do I

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,670
go where I wanted to meet more other

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,610
Python users

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,740
well enter Python urato and PI ladies

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,989
Toronto so about 20 that was just about

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,099
2013 so it was a while ago

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:16,019
and I remember going to like a Python

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,360
Toronto users group I'm sure a few of

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,819
you have been to such usually groups in

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,420
your local area as well and for me it

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,700
was incredibly intimidating on any given

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,000
meet-up these this would be like a room

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,890
of

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,390
eighty very experienced mostly males

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,970
developers all want to get together and

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,120
chat and kind of more or less nerd out

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,920
on the Python language and I found a

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,800
little bit hard to navigate especially

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,900
you know as someone who's not from a

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,209
traditional programming or stem

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,860
background and then on top of that being

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,170
new to programming needs a tech

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,690
community and now in a space of all

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,630
these people I it was really hard not to

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,150
shut down so many experienced developers

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,120
and I didn't know if people were open to

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,209
you know a newbie such as myself and you

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,050
know being in my twenties I was like and

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:12,660
female in a room of 80 guys yes it

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,910
became kind of like a I'm not sure I

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,580
didn't feel berry I didn't feel like I

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,150
belonged and even though people were

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,530
super welcoming is super nice I had to

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,050
start asking like where the people liked

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,660
me because even when these nice

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,040
gentlemen were here and helping out it

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,049
was kind of hard not to act you know

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,310
automatically start thinking like oh are

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,110
you only helping me because you want to

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,420
date me or you just here because you

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,489
care that I want to learn this

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,810
programming language and you're able to

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:45,030
answer some of my questions so in order

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,950
to start looking for people like me

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,350
let's go back to the very very beginning

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,390
to the very start of how Kylie's got

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,980
started over nine years ago so I was not

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,209
the only one apparently that had a very

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,269
similar question back in 2011 there was

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,959
a pineys kickoff at PyCon 2011 in

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:10,160
Atlanta they were founding members

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,860
Audrey Roy Greenfield estrin am

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,070
Christine Chung Jessica Stanton

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:22,200
Katherine Jamal Sandee strong and Sophia

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,310
Creek sorry Kirk Kirkland and it feels

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,290
like they were they also had a very

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,479
similar problem way back when was just

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,729
like they all wanted to learn more about

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,830
Python and they wanted to get a group

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,900
together particularly a woman to kind of

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,910
get this all going because they also had

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,530
a very similar problem where they were

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,660
also going to these meetups and people

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,740
were super nice but they wanted to find

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,350
people who

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,160
whereas passion ism and who just

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:50,190
happened to be women and so audrey wrote

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,340
a grant in 2011 titled pi ladies and

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:57,360
focused on these three areas education

00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:01,500
conference and outreach and then of

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,470
course the PSF very well then approved

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,900
proved it and as pi pi ladies continue

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,220
to champion the vision of diversity and

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,040
inclusion as it relates to gender

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,420
reputation and python and so if I

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,980
thought the community saw the need for a

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,440
centralized and organized program to

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,310
address this inequality they're like hey

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,580
that's great let's so the PSF registered

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:26,160
pi ladies and gave some grants to the

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:31,290
first pilot group which is pi ladies la

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:38,970
true run it's very first meetup in 2011

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:40,500
and from there next slide yep the PSF

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,860
then became a fiscal sponsor for pi

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,990
ladies and thus hi ladies became an

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,970
entity within the Python Software

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,160
Foundation so the very first chapter was

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,610
Los Angeles and if it goes the next

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,350
slide it started growing now this is the

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,950
current map of all the PI ladies

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,990
chapters but you mind it back in 2011

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,460
one chapter which then grew to two

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,670
chapters the second chapter being in

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,010
Melbourne and then followed by DC then

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,140
San Francisco which was started by Lynn

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,100
root in 2011 so it was starting to get

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,570
popularity and that became a clear need

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,520
when talking to Audrey about the very

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,420
beginnings of pi ladies Los Angeles she

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,830
commented about how exciting it was for

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,210
her and for the group to find

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,830
like-minded individuals such as

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,330
themselves to be able to geek out on

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,000
talking Python with each other could you

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,230
imagine a group of seven ladies hanging

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,240
out eating eating delicious food

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,130
drinking nice beverages and just saying

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,400
hey what do you think it was Jiang of

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:47,670
documentation it became something

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,980
incredibly special next slide and thus

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:53,240
we begin scaling pi ladies

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:58,970
so Lin here

00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:02,060
became a recipient of this lovely award

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,850
for being a great volunteer where she

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,190
helped scale pi ladies as accepted more

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,740
and more chapters from there they they s

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,800
this group of amazing woman set the

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,020
groundwork to the very very very start

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,880
to the point where they even developed

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,669
the mission statement where it reads

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,229
we're in each national sorry exactly

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,419
where international membership proved

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,130
with a focus on helping more women

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,289
become active participants and leaders

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,930
in the Python open source community our

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,759
mission is to promote educate and

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,830
advance a diverse Python community

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,740
through outreach education conferences

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,630
events of shops of gatherings Politis

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,210
also aims to provide a friendly support

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,310
network for women and bridge to a larger

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:48,729
Python world anyone who is interested I

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:51,050
thought is encouraged to participate now

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,270
what a mission statement from there from

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,009
from there being a 5-line 2011 with the

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,150
effort of these nine people with a

00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:00,979
fiscal sponsor project by the PSF

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,750
started a global movement and today it

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,510
is now international mentorship group

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:12,229
will focus on helping when we become

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:14,030
more active leaders in Python so there's

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,039
this mission still reflect the needs of

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,380
hides ladies today before we can

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,180
evaluate if these three pillars of

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,789
Education promotion outreach have been

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,280
successful we need to reflect on what

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,960
has worked and what has changed so let's

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,190
begin I'm gonna hand this off to Mary a

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,470
desk where we're gonna be celebrating a

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,470
wins because we've come a very long way

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,600
you're married

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:51,480
yes I'm just trying to figure how to

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:54,050
unmute myself sorry yeah thank you we

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,050
can slice that off

00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,110
yeah in the past nine years pilotis has

00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:05,280
grown we now have more than 90 chapters

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,980
worldwide across numerous countries each

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,320
of these chapters are volunteer run they

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,930
run events and workshops targeting women

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,090
audiences finally this community

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,400
provides the community for women the

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,820
opportunity for women to learn from

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,340
other women to help grow their career

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,820
our community have helped grow a new

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:31,970
generation of women speakers and open

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,970
source contributors and the impact we

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,610
look at the history of gender diversity

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:41,610
of bike on your speakers nine years ago

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,370
only 1% of speakers of bike on us were

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,250
women by 2016

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,320
40% of bike on us speakers were women

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:55,170
and this number has more or less

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:57,480
remained consistent we've asked our

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:01,100
community members my ladies members and

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,460
allies of what my reduce mean to them

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,860
here are some of their answers

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,980
Medellin campus from pilotis Miami said

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,560
but it is means inclusion support

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,500
knowledge sharing safe learning

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,500
environment opportunity and new friends

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,660
Felicia Hartman said but it is lack is

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,910
the only platform where I feel

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,310
comfortable answering other people's

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,800
programming questions it's really hard

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,050
to overcome the fear of being harshly

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,830
judged about one's level of competence

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,530
when you identify as women and pi radius

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:43,070
goes a long way in helping me overcome

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,070
that barrier

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,620
guido van rossum the

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,440
creator of Python set I heart by ladies

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,720
thank you all so much for making pythons

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,330
community more diverse and not just the

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,480
general by fancy myself as a feminist

00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:05,230
and an ally but you do the hard work and

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:09,400
make it stick way to go by ladies if you

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:14,700
remember five years ago at PyCon squid

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,700
Oh actually sat in his keynote that

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:24,040
there was by them Python has existed for

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,840
more than twenty years yet by them there

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,740
was no female Python core developers at

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:35,430
all the Python language summit in that

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:39,910
year has no female attendees at all I

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:43,090
was there listening to this speech in

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,730
person and I was able to attempt icon

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:49,450
that year only because of the financial

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,490
aid provided by PI ladies and some of

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,460
you know that it was his very speech

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,700
from five years ago that inspired me to

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,990
start contributing to Python and

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:05,830
eventually became a Python core

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:08,760
developer when I believe that when women

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,890
can see other women being present

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,310
participating in open-source when they

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:18,850
can see themselves represented they got

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:23,410
inspired to do the same and in the last

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:26,590
five years we've made progress I am

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,930
proud to share with you that this year's

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:32,610
title language summit was attended by

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:36,580
seven women much better than before and

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:39,520
they all actively participating in the

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:45,640
discussions three of them gave

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,420
presentations and lightning talks well

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,190
there are many

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,339
things that have been trending upwards

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,889
in moving the needle such as inclusion

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,959
of women and other marginalized

00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:59,290
communities in physical spaces like

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:02,200
PyCon or into Python user groups we

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:05,139
still continue to see struggle with

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:12,220
moving pilotis into roles of active

00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:15,760
leadership in open source community the

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:21,220
current pilot is model currently does

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,940
not scale and with that I will pass this

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,940
to Lorena

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:35,320
great thank you very much for setting

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,440
that stage up I know that the hard work

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,930
that our community has done on really

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,100
having a very deep conversation around

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,120
what is a very hard topic which is mired

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,410
there more women in the room

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,690
particularly when it comes to core

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,270
Python development is not an easy one to

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,160
have and as we sit there and we think

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,470
very critically about our successes and

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,830
what has worked and what hasn't one of

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,750
the things as really the official arm of

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,600
the Python Software Foundation looking

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:08,260
at one level of inclusion around gender

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,000
inclusion is obviously pilotis the

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,240
problem with the model however that we

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,070
see with pie ladies is that it well very

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,970
beneficial that pie ladies has this

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:23,200
strong emphasis on autonomy something

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:26,140
that has also been problematic with this

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,390
high emphasis on autonomy is that the

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,390
grassroots movement that exists in one

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:35,170
place may not have the same access to

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:37,750
resources to help power their chapter si

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,190
Chicago verse may be highly these

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,130
chapters in other parts of the world

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,720
that aren't in North America so looking

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,810
at kind of the duality of wanting to be

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,270
grassroots lead led while also having

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,730
strong emphasis on autonomy so that our

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,160
local chapters can decide what works for

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,070
them and best reflects the needs of

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,130
their local community one of the things

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,079
we've had to think about was well you

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,390
know honestly how are other people doing

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,220
that how are other groups how are other

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,230
groups actually building to think about

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,370
what pilotis Communities means for them

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,370
next slide please

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,900
and one of the places that we've seen

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:25,340
really really exciting success with PI

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:28,010
ladies has been in PI ladies Brazil this

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:33,590
past fall in 2019 I was able to

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:35,750
participate with Carol willing as an

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,630
honorary member of Pi ladies Brazil in

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:44,240
the assembly that they have every year

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:46,220
at Python at Python Brazil with about 26

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,890
chapters last time I checked throughout

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,900
the country pilotis Brazil is a prime

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,390
example showing how the grassroots

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,840
approach to community actually does work

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,670
and actually is succeeding pilotis

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,250
Brazil founder Deborah Acevedo

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,200
highlighted at the 2019 pilotis Brasil

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,730
assembly that the organize the

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,220
organization has been able to grow

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,500
however while they've been able to grow

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,030
and get more chapters one of the things

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,860
that continues to be a bottleneck for

00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,410
them is sustaining members and having

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,320
them and retaining members while also

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,070
working on broader on broader collective

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,830
initiatives specifically the problems

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:27,290
that that were being highlighted there

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,990
led to for example a bottleneck and

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,690
having access to funds you know without

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,700
without having access to such simple

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,620
things as maybe money to be able to

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,290
purchase a ticket to be able to go to

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:43,550
Python Brazil where these official

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,800
events happen you pie ladies you aren't

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,170
able to really go beyond just that local

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,510
conversation in your user group if there

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,940
is even a user group in your area so

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,530
this idea of having access to funds that

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,870
was a huge one that that was being

00:16:54,530 --> 00:17:00,320
highlighted in the pie ladies Brazil

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:03,770
assembly also another thing too that the

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,030
assembly called out was really just even

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,400
the idea of saying you know how do we

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,339
get started if if there's already not a

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,930
strong community you can lean into what

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,209
kind of what kind of content should you

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,420
be writing what kind of content should

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,189
you not only be writing and talking

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,839
about but you know the number of hours

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:24,110
it takes to actually create content to

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,420
is a problem so again while we might be

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,839
well the while the emphasis on having

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,150
very strong

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,120
chapters allows you to control what kind

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,529
of content you put into the world

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,880
essentially each time our pilotis

00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,350
chapters are having to reinvent the

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,650
wheel and start from scratch

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,409
so this theme of this theme of wanting

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,990
to have a sense of community that isn't

00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,789
just tied to your physical location but

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,029
is actually more of a kind of global

00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:53,669
dialogue a global community that message

00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,080
really I think resonates with me as

00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,049
someone who's been a pilot Eze organizer

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,220
for now over four four and a half years

00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:03,779
next slide please

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,970
so when we think about rebuilding the

00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,250
future that really is a hard question

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,820
and in it's one that has a lot of

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:14,159
nuances and and I I joke that sometimes

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,750
my answer to things so things like how

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,490
do we build for the future I'm like I

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,419
don't know it's complicated it depends

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,549
so jokes aside this theme here though

00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,049
that I that I've been seeing has been

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,690
this tension between the duality of

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,029
wanting to wanting to be a local first

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,370
model while also building a a global

00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:35,130
brand and that global brand

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,409
I think this tension between local and

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,240
global I think really speaks to kind of

00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,520
some of the struggles that pilot e has

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,320
had in terms of what is that global

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,220
identity what is that global brand that

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,870
that we need to think about that work so

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,700
well our local chapter but has limited

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,750
us in really building this bigger

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,240
initiative so when we think about you

00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,620
know building for the futures really I

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,480
think we need to start with a simple

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,970
question which is what is it that

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,120
pilotis is building for next slide

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,220
please

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,820
this was a question that I have asked

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,799
many people over times and as Elaine

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,169
mentioned in the beginning part of this

00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,240
talk one of the people that has been

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:19,559
that I've turned to when I've had a lot

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,169
of questions thinking about the

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,730
evolution of the pilotis model has been

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,770
some of the early has and some of the

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,190
early folks that have helped that help

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,960
scale pilot is to what it is today

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:35,340
specifically which is a lane route who's

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,530
who's who's shown here selling us the

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,260
agenda for the workshop that we held at

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,540
PyCon us in 2019 that we titled the

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,770
future of us

00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,780
this this workshop it was something that

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,250
again I've had these kind of

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,940
conversations with people time after

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,650
time

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,220
about you know how do we better get

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,660
people to work on pie ladies like even

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,330
the website or how do we get better

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,980
access to funds and things like that but

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,350
some but another thing that actually I

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,020
think real it the fire to get this

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,720
dialogue going was was when New York

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,560
City pilotis organizer reshawna Sheikh

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,900
wrote up a observation looking at some

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,760
of the stagnation of diversity building

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,090
not only in Python but just in

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,470
open-source in general looking looking

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,940
at that article there was a lot of these

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,490
themes that were talking about about

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,080
succession planning about about building

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,820
global kind of movements and really

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,880
leaning in and thinking about not only

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,590
as diversity about not only is it about

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,730
getting a seat at the table but it's

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,900
also about it really is it really is us

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,810
investing in ourselves and really it is

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,670
it is also not we want to retain people

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,230
basically it's not just about getting a

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,630
seat at the table so it's making sure

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,580
that people it's making sure that people

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,320
are actually being able to bring their

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,850
authentic selves share their words be

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,740
and they are being heard and they are

00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,720
being incorporated into the conversation

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,600
I've heard diversity and inclusion

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,670
explained explained like this before

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,800
diversity is being invited to the party

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,910
inclusion is being asked to dance and I

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,130
think that's a really good metaphor

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,600
because when we look at pie ladies we've

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,850
done so much great work within the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,920
Python space about creating space at the

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,240
table but in thinking about what comes

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,250
next those are the those are the

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,570
questions that are a lot harder to

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,090
answer and that's kind of what this

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,590
workshop was meant to get at so the

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,680
purpose of this workshop the future of

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,460
us the way that we organized it was we

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,170
we basically did as all good as all good

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,550
technical minded people do we wanted to

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,740
use this workshop a little bit as a

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,090
retro so doing a retro and pie lady's

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,830
determining what our current challenges

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,470
are and then actually trying to

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,720
rapid-fire start proposing answers to

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,360
those solutions folks that week that

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,010
were in attendance were actually hand

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,390
invited since we were looking to get a

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,540
breadth of different different

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,860
perspectives and really the breadth of

00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,370
those different perspectives what we

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,660
wanted to make

00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,730
sure that we did on the other side of

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,100
this workshop was take the conversation

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,470
that we had and actually then start

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,880
tying it to tangible goals that we could

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,559
publish and start bringing to the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,600
community to the larger community so we

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,600
can have more feedback next slide please

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:16,340
so the one of the things I think that

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,220
made this workshop so successful and

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,470
really I think a really good kind of

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,750
again that moment where we lit the fire

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,120
was we weren't able to get a really

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,429
great cross-section of folks to come

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,850
together to have this conversation in

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,370
that in the photo here that we tweeted

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,080
after we wrapped up the workshop I think

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:39,380
this just kind of speaks to speaks to

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,440
some of the great kind of the great kind

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,000
of perspectives we were able to to

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,910
highlight in this conversation so we had

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,780
an organizer Alicia from from India we

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,700
have Python Software Foundation director

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,020
Marlene who was able to kind of talk to

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,200
us a little bit of some of the work that

00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:00,920
she's done around women and programming

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,740
in the broader space of Africa as we can

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,240
see there us three were there so we had

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,150
a good kind of smattering of people

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,620
across North America as well as folks

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,690
from Latin America from Europe and

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,360
really just getting people together to

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,410
talk about things it's amazing when it's

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,850
amazing we you actually get people

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,700
together to talk how quickly things

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,530
concern can start moving so one of the

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,900
things that from this workshop that

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,150
beyond just a B and just being really

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,610
intentional about making sure that we

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,559
were having a global population of

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,420
people talking about what we want to

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,410
build for the future of pilotis was also

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,080
making sure that we actually had like

00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,390
what is the thing we're gonna do next

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,900
because because as we all know making a

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,130
big problem even bigger and then adding

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,110
300 steps that you're not gonna get

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,580
anywhere you know we need to have Steve

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,960
tangible that we can work towards and

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,730
really the big thing that we thought

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,460
that we all were saying what that we

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,320
know would be helpful was we really need

00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,870
to start talking about a PI latest

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,530
global governance model so on September

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,360
15 2019 we opened a request for comment

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,429
for the PI ladies government governance

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,040
model on github and then we did a

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:14,080
write-up of the workshop

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:16,150
hi ladies calm next slide please so the

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,220
governance model that we looked at

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,640
actually we spent some time researching

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,970
and looking at other dyke diversity and

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,190
inclusion minded groups in technology to

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,230
kind of think about you know what models

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,080
have been proven to work what models

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,550
kind of align with this with our core

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,610
values again core values really

00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:38,410
emphasizing having strong local

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,120
leadership and not trying to create

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,610
something that's so process heavy that

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,690
it gets hard to do anything and one of

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,320
the groups that we were really inspired

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,570
by was our our ladies like pi ladies our

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,960
ladies is a group that has a lot of

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,150
strong local chapters they are a very

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,280
grassroots minded organization

00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,380
there isn't a necessarily like paid

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,820
staff of people that works on it so

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,260
again it's a lot of volunteers who are

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,580
working on running this community and

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,520
that's not like a really good place for

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,220
us to start so what we see here with

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,440
this request for comment model that we

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,330
propose is one of the things that we

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,250
really wanted to that we really wanted

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,230
to make sure we did was one we want to

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,050
make sure there's a group of people from

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:24,040
from across the globe that would sit in

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:26,860
some kind of publicly elected seat of

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,210
power which we work which we at the time

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,840
we're calling the global leadership team

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,790
and that group would then be the voice

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,580
to the Python Software Foundation they

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:38,590
would be the ones that actually are

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,660
answering questions of like how do how

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,160
does my chapter you know in Chicago get

00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,480
access to funds so they're actually

00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,970
gonna be people who will be talking

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,510
about the the bigger the bigger picture

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:52,150
items and then a balance alongside that

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,280
we have as you can see this list of

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,160
project teams so the project teams here

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,020
ranging from finance resources to

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,330
actually working on like our tech and

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,530
marketing and code of conduct all those

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,640
are meant to be project teams that are

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,820
actually managed like open source

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,290
efforts so allowing people to you know

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,810
sometimes people want to get involved

00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:16,840
with Pi Lee's but not as speaker not as

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,070
a event host maybe they don't want to

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,330
organize but they want to help with

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,340
something specific because that's where

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,100
their passion lies again back to kind of

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,660
volunteer minded Oh

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,130
allowing people to have the ability to

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,630
work on things that are packed that they

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,660
are passionate about that's what these

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,010
project teams have been meant to that's

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,929
what these project teams are meant to

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,990
focus on so there's this global

00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,690
leadership model I'm actually putting in

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,220
a group of people that are steering the

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,980
ship keeping us keeping us moving

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,929
forward while also allowing more moments

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,990
and ways for meaningful engagement for

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:52,940
pilotis that right here is why we came

00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:57,450
up with this model next slide please

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,159
so cool we had the 2019 workshop we

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,320
started some of these project teams we

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,990
actually had a dialogue with our with

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,940
our community around how do we want you

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,909
know what kind of modernist model should

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:12,150
be should we have what comes next we've

00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:15,419
got to pick our global what we now call

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:18,450
the global the global Council and we're

00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,880
actually have been doing so much work in

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,440
thinking about how we can get again

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,150
really strong emphasis on wanting to

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,890
have that global that global

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,039
representation how can we get people

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,110
from across the world that are part of

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,870
pilotis to actually participate in this

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:37,200
and one of the things that we did we did

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:40,320
a write-up on the entire what is this

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,850
governance model what is gonna be this

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,770
global council and how can you

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,690
participate in the election we actually

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:48,510
we did a lot of really good work in

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,850
getting it translated so between the

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,630
Python translation list between hi

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:56,010
ladies community members and just us

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,780
finding people that can help us do some

00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,950
translation actually which that's done

00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,580
really quick and I was really impressed

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,230
Thank You Python but we were able to

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:10,260
actually do this call out in six

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:13,530
languages yes 6 6 plus English so 7 my

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,720
bad but so we have in Arabic in Chinese

00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm specifically Mandarin French

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,320
Portuguese Russian and Spanish so we're

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,059
doing this call out and trying to meet

00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,700
people in their language of comfort in

00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:25,350
their language of choice to publicize

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,190
this and another thing that we did is

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:31,500
we've baked into the global council a a

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,299
regional requirement so one of the

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,980
things here at you can see that

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,429
diversity and inclusion requirements is

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,169
that

00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:39,730
basically we don't want there to be like

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,440
all nine people from the United States

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,999
that that's not something that's going

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,340
to actually help us get that global

00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:48,249
brand that we really want so instead

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,970
we've put a we put a requirement saying

00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:53,409
that no no no more than 33 percent of

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,679
the board can reside in the same country

00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:58,059
so for example if we were trying to have

00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:59,259
four people from the United States nope

00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,889
that won't fly because we have nine

00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:05,259
seats and we max a three for folks that

00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:07,749
reside in the United States other things

00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:09,190
about diversity inclusion that we're

00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,080
thinking about and we definitely know we

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,360
can iterate on again thinking about

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,619
access to language and obviously there's

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,450
a lot of other things that come enter

00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,610
this conversation but to start we're

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,399
going to look at the regional and allow

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,019
that initial cohort of the global

00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,669
counsel team to kind of iterate on

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,860
policies they think would be good to

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:29,409
continue to hold us accountable in

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,840
making this this team as inclusive and

00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:38,980
as diverse as possible next slide please

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,649
so I another thing too the the only

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,869
other thing that we have also instituted

00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:46,029
beyond a regional requirement is we

00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:48,340
actually are going to have both the

00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:49,419
we'll have some number of seats that are

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,190
going to be selected through public

00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:54,159
election and then we have some seats

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,860
that are going to be where people can

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,070
actually apply for them the the idea

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,169
here of what we're thinking about is

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,149
obviously as we understand when it comes

00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:06,610
to campaigning sometimes name

00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:08,950
recognition is a thing and if you know

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,509
me it that that's free we have a lot of

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,980
really exciting people in our community

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,240
but unfortunately with Nick with name

00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,940
recognition you know that could be

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,379
biased towards people that you know have

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,210
been around for a long time and maybe

00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:20,470
you know again another thing that we

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,210
want to think about is having pilotis

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,149
that are at different points in their

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,559
career being able to being able to be a

00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:28,659
part of this group as well because they

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,070
are just as awesome so again kind of

00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,799
like allowing different ways to do that

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,539
and again in a democratic fashion we

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,610
brought that we brought these proposals

00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:39,850
for how to run the election to work to

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,559
our our organizers for our pilotis

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,179
chapters and overwhelmingly everyone

00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:45,850
says yes let's do a dual kind of

00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:47,139
application or election and that's what

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,259
we're going to be doing next slide

00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,259
please

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,289
all is to say it's been it's been an

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,059
awesome year and while we were really

00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:00,360
hoping to do some more content around

00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:02,549
this at PyCon us in person we definitely

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,730
are trying to be present and answer

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:08,130
questions as best as we can for people

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,260
so please do kind of keep an eye out for

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,429
some opportunities through the pie

00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,080
lady's Twitter and the pie lady's

00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:16,919
