Brian K Okken

Parametrization is one of the superpowers of pytest. It allows you to cover a huge number of test cases with a single test function. This speeds up test writing and makes test maintenance easier. This talk is a medium depth dive into pytest parametrization, with techniques you can use right away.

This talk will use of code examples, starting with a simple test then demonstrating 3 methods of parametrization, as well as test case identifiers and using generators.
