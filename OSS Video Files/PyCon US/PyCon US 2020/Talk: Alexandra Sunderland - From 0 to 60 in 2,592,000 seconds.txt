When anyone starts on a new team, there’s a ramp-up period where a ton of knowledge is transferred: there are new processes, names, tools, frameworks, and so many other different details to remember. Meanwhile, critical new relationships are started, and lasting impressions are formed. New team members that don’t get to follow a defined process during this time are at risk of not receiving all the information they need to be effective fast, and of not feeling valued by their team.

As an engineer that loves a good repeatable process, I decided that I’d like to make onboarding engineers a task that is both effective and scalable. If you’re bringing on one new engineer or fifty to your project, having a formalized process in place ensures that they can get up to speed on your project quickly, and receive a fair start on the team.

Whether you’re a manager, a lead, or a developer eager to help out, you’ll learn how to create your own exceptional onboarding process, and hear about my own onboarding failures and eventual success.
