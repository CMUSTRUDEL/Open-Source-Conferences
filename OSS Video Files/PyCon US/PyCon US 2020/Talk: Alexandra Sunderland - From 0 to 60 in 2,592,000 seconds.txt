Alexandra Sunderland

When anyone starts on a new team, there’s a ramp-up period where a ton of knowledge is transferred: there are new processes, names, tools, frameworks, and so many other different details to remember. Meanwhile, critical new relationships are started, and lasting impressions are formed. New team members that don’t get to follow a defined process during this time are at risk of not receiving all the information they need to be effective fast, and of not feeling valued by their team.

As an engineer that loves a good repeatable process, I decided that I’d like to make onboarding engineers a task that is both effective and scalable. If you’re bringing on one new engineer or fifty to your project, having a formalized process in place ensures that they can get up to speed on your project quickly, and receive a fair start on the team.

Whether you’re a manager, a lead, or a developer eager to help out, you’ll learn how to create your own exceptional onboarding process, and hear about my own onboarding failures and eventual success.

hi everyone thanks for joining my talk

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,080
today about onboarding engineers onto

00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,490
your team it's too bad that we don't get

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,930
to see each other in person but I'm

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,550
really glad that I get to share this

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,380
with a broader audience especially

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,120
because a lot has changed in the world

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,860
between the time that I submitted this

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,710
talking now and I think it's impossible

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,360
to ignore that reality some people are

00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,670
going to be starting new jobs remotely

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,590
and that's adding a layer of complexity

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,270
onto something that is already pretty

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,770
difficult so I'm gonna take the

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,570
opportunity to talk about different

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,040
approaches for remote onboarding

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,930
throughout this talk to address some of

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,820
the nuances and help everyone provide

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,629
the best experience that they can right

00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,460
now I've been working as an engineer for

00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,720
nearly the last decade and I've been a

00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,280
fellow for the last year and a half

00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,989
where I'm currently on the engineering

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,000
team in Ottawa Canada

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:02,979
I spend a lot of time putting together

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,960
onboarding processes and helping

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,909
engineers get set up on new teams I

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,130
created the onboarding process that

00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,780
fellow and before that I was at Survey

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,460
Monkey where I taught some into classes

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,080
that newly hired engineers went through

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,760
and I was a coordinator for the

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,590
internship program where I had to help

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,310
teams get set up for their students and

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,360
bring a lot of people onto team this is

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,680
something that I have a lot of

00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,780
experience with and I've been collecting

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,329
feedback on for years and it's a topic

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,530
that I find pretty important I think

00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:31,390
that one of the most important skills

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,070
you can have is engineer and especially

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,930
as a manager is empathy

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,430
whether it's empathy for the people

00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,380
using your product the people

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,549
interacting with your team or the people

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,340
that need to go through the processes

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,079
you've set up on your team part of that

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,000
empathy is towards people who are

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,159
perhaps nervously joining and have no

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,020
context on what tools you use what

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,939
process you have and what your tech

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,159
stock looks like something that might

00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:56,200
seem obvious to you might not even be

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,119
something that new hires think of asking

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,789
about and it makes it harder to get up

00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,590
to speed as fast it would like and might

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,570
make the people feel like they're not

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,369
doing such a great job or aren't smart

00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,679
enough I'm going to show you how to

00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,880
avoid this situation so that your new

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,280
teammates can get up to speed quickly

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,000
and you can create a great culture on

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,069
your team I think that the reason I feel

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
a particular empathy for people starting

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,090
a new job is because of how absolutely

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,760
lost I felt when I started my first

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,930
programming job when I was really young

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,310
I was lucky enough to get

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,250
internship over the summer before

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,010
University at a local startup and I mean

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,620
super lucky I knew how to program but

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,930
basically only in Visual Basic I never

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,180
heard of the web or programming with

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,010
like Python or HTML or JavaScript I

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,930
didn't even know that you could have web

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,430
apps as a business because this was back

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,280
when you download most software that you

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,290
wanted to use so long story short I

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,299
spent weeks googling things like what is

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,000
an API what is a web hook

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,549
what is request what is a server and how

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,049
do you log into server getting

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,450
progressively more and more detailed

00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:03,400
because I had no idea what's going on I

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,930
didn't know who to ask I felt like it

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,450
was assumed that I was supposed to have

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,519
all the answers because there was no

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,030
onboarding process I felt a little bit

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,349
lost and that has always stuck with me

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,629
it was also a great learning experience

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:18,669
I think that I learned the most that

00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,010
summer out of all of them but this kind

00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:23,500
of experience isn't scalable when you're

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,459
trying to onboard 5 10 or 50 engineers

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,079
into your company since then I've helped

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,519
onboard a lot of people in a lot of

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,199
different ways and I've screwed up in

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,449
the process a lot too

00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,310
the first time I on boarded someone was

00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,019
when I was still an intern returning for

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,970
the summer and a brand new intern was

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,590
brought on board I was supposed to hand

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,209
off the project I'd built to him and I

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,919
basically just sat him down for a day

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,659
and did a line-by-line walkthrough of

00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,579
the entire code base to tell him

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,530
everything that I knew and thought that

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,569
would be the end of it that kind of

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,970
information isn't useful without the

00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,650
context around business requirements the

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,720
why of the product and knowing the

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,549
people who are using it and no one's

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,290
gonna remember the details of thousands

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,199
of lines of code and no one is gonna

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,449
care by overloading him with information

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,650
nothing was remembered and I got a lot

00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,359
of questions over the next few months

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,250
which could have been avoided if I'd

00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,439
focused on a strategy that set him up to

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,440
be able to figure out answers for

00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,449
himself at my last job the engineering

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,099
organization had this onboarding process

00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,199
where new hires had to go through a

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,909
series of courses in their first two

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,340
weeks to get up to speed on different

00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:29,050
technologies that we used I taught the

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,539
intro to ginger course which is a

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,949
templating system used with Django but

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,020
we had so many different products and

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,659
teams in the company the only a handful

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,580
of the new hires would ever use ginger

00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,289
so a lot of people would skip out

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,659
sessions are not finding the cotton

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:45,520
content relevant and these courses will

00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,349
be taught to junior developers and

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,330
senior developers and just about

00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:51,039
everyone and a lot of it was just going

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,500
over things you couldn't look up easily

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,599
and dock the documentation everyone

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,430
relieved these kinds of sessions feeling

00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,379
like they'd wasted time and I eventually

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,599
felt defeated and like I wasn't teaching

00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:04,479
anything cool or useful so I stepped

00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,039
down as the instructor and while you

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,889
might know I'm gonna set up courses or

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,240
some large structure to teach everyone

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,639
everything you might think they need to

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,289
know it's equally important to not skip

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,210
over anything that might seem obvious to

00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,909
you and assume that the new person knows

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,650
everything this is true for technical

00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,449
things like maybe someone is an

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,919
incredible Python programmer but just

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,449
has never gotten around to try and

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,610
kubernetes and so they need a quick

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,840
intro or at least a heads up that's

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,930
something that they should be looking

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,129
into you it's also relevant for

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,349
organizational and interpersonal things

00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:36,520
too it's important to be weary of

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,379
people's backgrounds

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,870
maybe someone your team has worked at a

00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:43,000
tech company and knows what a scrum is

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,669
and is on board with agile and waterfall

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,680
and alls process things but a new hire

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,180
could be doing from an agency where they

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,620
didn't have those kinds of structures

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,870
and it might be kind of lost if you

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,629
don't take the time to walk through how

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,669
you get work done on your team a while

00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,639
ago I was onboarding someone and partway

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,110
through the high level codebase overview

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,599
they stopped me because they hadn't even

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,650
seen the product live before they didn't

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,719
know the overall structure of the

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,889
company and they incorrectly thought

00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:11,289
that I was their manager

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,240
I made this assumption that people had a

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:16,599
baseline understanding of what was going

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,099
on and I was wrong pretty often I can't

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,810
feel awkward for people to ask what

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,270
seemed like basic questions when they're

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,889
still new because by your confidence it

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,690
can seem like they should know the

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,029
answers already and it might be afraid

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,979
to bring it up it's important to go into

00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,169
onboarding assuming that the person has

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,089
the skills and the abilities to perform

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,759
the job they were hired to do that has

00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:38,349
none of the context yet plus reiteration

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,940
of some of the things they might already

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:42,610
know doesn't hurt at this stage because

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,050
repetition and reinforcement is key when

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,629
there's so much new stuff to learn

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,219
eventually after making a lot more

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,899
mistakes with a lot more people I

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:51,930
narrowed down a framework for onboarding

00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,250
then we now use it follow

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,530
and probably about a half the company

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,759
has been through no matter what process

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,650
you come up with one of the most

00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,570
important steps is to ask for feedback

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,729
so that you can figure out what parts

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,130
need improving which parts are not

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,380
helpful and what is valuable but it

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,940
needs to stick around I send out the

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,530
same feedback survey to every new hire

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,330
at the end of their first week on the

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,160
job so that I can get a good idea of

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,960
what needs to change it has brought a

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,360
lot of great insights and it's shaped

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,889
our process for the better and this

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,600
framework is what I would like to share

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,759
with you today so that you too can

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,560
create your own onboarding process to

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,880
get engineers on your team up to speed

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,650
quickly and effectively before we get

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,960
started it's important to frame

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,460
everything you do and every process that

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,560
you set up through the eyes of the new

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,690
hire and you'll need an abundance of

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,820
empathy think back to when you first

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,039
started all the questions you had and

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,570
the difficulties you encounter remember

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,580
that when they start they'll likely

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,039
won't know anyone or any of the process

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,570
or tradition and will feel a little out

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,419
of place when they try to get up to

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,610
speed and at this time it's especially

00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,530
important to have an even deeper sense

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,270
of empathy whether or not they were

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,030
hired to work remotely if the current

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,130
situation is not normal remote work if

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,020
they were hired expecting to come into

00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,199
an office they might not have a proper

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,909
office setup at home or they might just

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,979
not have fast internet they might be

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:16,199
looking after kids or just overall not

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,780
have the ideal work from home setup

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,759
whatever their situation it's important

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,680
to be patient and understanding and to

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,240
often be reassuring them that you're

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,009
there for them and that you to

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,009
understand that this won't be a totally

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,720
normal work environment for a while the

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,150
most important part of onboarding is

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,909
setting up the right relationships early

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,650
on by making these connections early it

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,450
will be easier for the person to open a

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,950
line of communication with others to ask

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,680
any questions that they'll need answers

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,870
to and it can be awkward coming in

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,550
somewhere and not knowing who is in

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,230
charge of what or who'd ask her and

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,290
things from or not knowing whether

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,820
people even realize you exist some of

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,110
the most important interactions that you

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,420
can start setting up are your

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,950
one-on-ones make sure that you set up

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,500
your first one-on-one with your new

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,120
direct report early on and keep it going

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,980
on a regular cycle so that they know

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,760
they have a time and space to talk to

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,890
you about the

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,540
career goals their ideas concerns and

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,670
whatever else they might have to say

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,140
this is a great time for you to get a

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,550
good pulse check on how they're doing

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,000
and talk about things that they might

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,350
not want to bring up in team meetings

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,890
introducing them to team members is

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,360
important and sometimes forgotten make

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,130
your team aware in advance that someone

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,980
is joining and let them know to welcome

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,360
them make sure to introduce them to the

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,610
people on the other team so I'll be

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,440
working with two as an engineer you

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,680
might be working with designers or

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,930
product people or sales or what have you

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,360
having these lines of communication open

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,730
early on can make collaboration easier

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,210
later when it comes time for projects

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,040
and lastly set them up with a buddy

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,690
it'll be easier for them to ask

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,820
questions if they know that they have a

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,560
dedicated person to go to who is

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,710
expecting to be overloaded with

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,120
questions for the first little while

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,220
while you're working remotely this step

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,830
is especially important and has to be

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,360
done in a very deliberate way since the

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,950
hallway talk and the chance of running

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,140
into someone by the coffee machine and

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,990
being able to introduce yourself is so

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,060
much lower a good practice is to use a

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,950
slack message or an email to have a new

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,830
hire introduce themselves to their team

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,300
or company sock I find is better because

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,070
then everyone can interact with the

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,600
message and put little emojis and it

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,160
makes you feel very at home and very

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,220
happy right away you don't get that

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,380
interaction with email setting them up

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,910
with a buddy here is very important

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,650
because when you can't physically see

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,360
whether or not someone is getting

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,610
annoyed with your questions you're gonna

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,260
be less likely to ask them and this is a

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,780
point in time where is critical to ask

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,340
as many questions as possible if they're

00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,840
set up with a dedicated question

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,210
answerer they won't feel bad about it

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,410
instead of sending emails to intro them

00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,630
to the people they'll be working with

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,310
set up individual video calls so that

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,680
they can get a feel of how the person

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,870
communicates getting an indication for

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,880
things like sarcasm level and speech can

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,220
be vital information and avoid a lot of

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,290
awkward mix ups don't schedule them all

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,510
back to back though video call fatigue

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,610
is very real and if you're new hire is

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,010
an introvert this will be an exhausting

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,470
step of an already stressful process for

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:16,080
them there is a lot of knowledge that

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,210
your team has which is just known stuff

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,200
that any outsider would not be able to

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,930
figure out for them

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,090
without asking and your team absolutely

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,220
has this and it is creating a bottleneck

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,190
figure out what it is and write it down

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,840
if there's ever any issue that someone

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,030
on the team encounters and someone says

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,040
oh yeah happen to me last week and I did

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,260
whatever to solve it and write that down

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,910
if there's an announcement at a team

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,590
meeting about a new way of doing things

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,860
or a new linter to install or whatever

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,210
write that down and this doesn't have to

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,160
look like the type of documentation

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,200
you'd expect from a third-party library

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,270
or API but I should cover the things

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,520
that are super specific to your team and

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,900
won't just help out your new hires it'll

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,510
end up paying off of the people within

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,400
the team too I've gone back on our own

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,320
def talks plenty of times to remember

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,840
how to run certain tests or set up an

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,950
environment just writing actively

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
encourage everyone on the team to

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,280
contribute to this documentation it

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,320
should be a collaborative effort and

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,510
represent the thinking of everyone and

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,820
you can set up this knowledgebase in any

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,770
online collaboration tool we host an

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,480
internal doc site built on the read the

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,530
docs big theme because it's nice and

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,260
familiar to us

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,540
Python devs similar to your code based

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,540
documentation you should create a team

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,580
and company FAQ there are a lot of non

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,890
code things that are just known within

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,780
the team - like how to properly create a

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,580
pull request how to request time off

00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,250
what's your process you should follow

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,830
and how to hand off tickets to QA where

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,720
the Wi-Fi info stored or even what dev

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,910
meeting etiquette is and whether or not

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,770
you need to prepare anything there's a

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,840
lot and while it can be figured out over

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,460
time it can reduce stress by having

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,620
answers to some of those questions up

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,840
front this is also something that

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,460
everyone on your team can contribute to

00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,740
and it should be something that new

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,420
hires add questions to while they're

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,510
discovering that they wish they knew

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,000
something oh this FAQ and the code base

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,650
documentation are especially helpful for

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,050
people working remotely where they don't

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,910
have the in-person context available or

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,280
won't have people around it they can

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,500
just quickly ask it can help people feel

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,600
more confident going into a situation or

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,630
point them towards other questions that

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,520
they should be asking one of the biggest

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,920
stress inducing parts of joining a new

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,470
team is not knowing what you're expected

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,360
to accomplish and by when it's common to

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,540
see people going overboard trying to do

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,520
as much as they possibly can in the

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,290
as a matter of time or working overtime

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,180
in the first few months while pretending

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,070
that they aren't just to make it seem

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,720
like they have it all together it can

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,370
feel like you're supposed to be as good

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,140
as the existing team members when you

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,060
join and that's impossible to achieve

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,260
because you aren't used to the codebase

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,730
yet and you don't have all this

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,850
institutional knowledge that they've

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,800
acquired over maybe years to combat that

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,030
set out a realistic timeline for

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,610
different goals for them to accomplish

00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,560
for example break down the dev setup

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,750
process into small chunks like getting

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,280
localhost running getting third-party

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,740
integrations hooked up getting tests

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,620
passing or whatever which might span a

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,240
day then set out a goal for completing a

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,760
particular ticket creating a pull

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,770
request or whatever little units of work

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,230
that you can do in one week on your team

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,700
you should be easily accomplishable so

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,120
that the new hire feels like they're on

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,680
track when you check each one off then

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,030
set up goals for them to track their

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,500
progress throughout the next three

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,060
months they should have a clear

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,070
understanding of what knowledge they're

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,010
expected to have and what pace they

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,720
should be working at at that point by

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,820
defining exactly what you're looking for

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,530
it won't burn themselves out and will

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,450
know how to plan out their work to meet

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,490
the goals it gives them something to

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,320
work towards and if they surpass

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,090
expectations and they'll get a chance to

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,650
be pleased with themselves and getting

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:52,880
that boosts their productivity in return

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,710
celebrate the goals and milestones that

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
they achieve on a team slack channel

00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,400
it's not easy for them to swivel their

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,660
chair around and happily announce to

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,670
their desk neighbor that they've created

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,560
their first pull request so look out for

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,810
those moments and call them out so that

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,000
the team can celebrate with them even

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,410
when I was in the office in person one

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,390
of the ways that I felt extremely

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,160
welcome to the team was when my manager

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,810
comped it on my first pull request

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,110
saying that I did a great job and

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:21,590
congratulations this might seem obvious

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,090
but as actually sometimes forgotten make

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,340
sure that you have a computer in any

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,290
required hardware for people well in

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,630
advance of their anticipated start date

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,250
it might be a bit tough to join a team

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,470
as a programmer when you don't have a

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,390
laptop or a keyboard or if you haven't

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,070
even been allocated a desk yet and

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,190
people scramble to clean off the desk

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,080
that was being used as storage for you

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,760
when people are working remotely you'll

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,290
have to take this a step further and

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,300
figure out how to get Hardware to

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,100
person's home make sure that you take

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,839
into account any installation their IT

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,880
might have to do before getting them is

00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,680
a laptop although if you have IT you

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,449
might in a large enough company that you

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,790
don't have to worry about the process of

00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:00,620
getting them a laptop people who are

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,819
working from home right now might not

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,589
have been expecting to you and their

00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:06,139
homes might not be set up with a proper

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,610
office space try to figure out whether

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,310
your company can allocate a budget

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,750
outfit their home office or theirs any

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,269
equipment that can be loaned to them

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,009
having a desk chair and a monitor can

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,540
make a huge difference compared to

00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,399
sitting on the couch looking down at a

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,769
laptop for weeks and it will make them a

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,720
lot more productive I did this for a few

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,779
months in University and I had to get

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,579
physio to fix my back it's also good to

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,259
make sure that they have fast unlimited

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,940
internet otherwise doing things like

00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,490
having video calls or installing

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,860
software might be a cause for concern

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,389
for them asking for feedback is

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,889
something that doesn't come naturally

00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:41,660
especially if it's about you or

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,699
something you've made and you're proud

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,829
of but it's a crucial step in the

00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:47,720
process because if you don't you might

00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:50,000
be missing out on key insights about

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,949
things that aren't working I have a

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,750
feedback survey that I send to every new

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,670
engineer after their first week on their

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,399
team which I send within follows

00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,110
feedback feature I ask them some star

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,899
rating questions so we can track metrics

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,640
over time but also a lot of open-ended

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,860
questions about what worked really well

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,510
and what didn't and I asked for ideas on

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,089
what they do to make their first week

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,439
easier if they could go over it again

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,329
it's played a big part in how we've

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,220
shaped the process and every piece of

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,829
feedback we get makes it even easier for

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,600
the next person joining the team we also

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,549
make it easy for people to contribute

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,829
their feedback directly into the process

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,470
the frequently asked questions section

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,540
and team documentation are editable by

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,669
anyone and they're encouraged to correct

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,049
anything that's no longer valid and make

00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:34,610
pull requests to make sure that we're

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,040
keeping all of our information up to

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,990
date these little contributions help

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,600
them feel like they're more part of the

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,400
team too so that's a lot of tips and

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,290
steps but it might be hard to visualize

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,090
this as an actual process that

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,980
translates into something that you can

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,630
run your new hires through so I'm going

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,140
to show you a bit of how we've put this

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,590
together

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,270
apfel oh this is an example template of

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,080
a note that we use for people joining

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,659
the team this guys create

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,429
and attached to the all-day event that

00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,679
everyone has in their calendar marking

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,390
the first day of the new hire and it's

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,279
divided up into different sections that

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,100
cover each of the steps that I outlined

00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,640
on this note you'll find a list of

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,140
helpful resources your teammate names

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,090
and then also a whole bunch of little

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,309
different digestible goals so we have

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,740
two engineering sections at the bottom

00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,870
and these are to break down the

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,809
installation process and the JIRA

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,740
process in a little checkable format so

00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,139
that you can feel like you're

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,330
accomplishing something managers have

00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:35,789
access to this note too so they can

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,440
easily see how the new hire is

00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,080
progressing throughout their first day

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,730
or a few days without having to ask them

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,289
constantly how they're doing and whether

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,899
or not they're stuck because they can

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,149
easily see it from here outside of this

00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:50,460
note we also set up a lot of different

00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:54,000
things like one-on-ones with managers

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,559
team lunches sales demo Tagalongs and

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,299
different meetings like that because

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,630
relationships really are the most

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,880
important part of onboarding with these

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,630
six steps is a baseline relationships

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,429
knowledge FAQ goals space and feedback

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,350
they'll be well on your way to creating

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:12,539
a repeatable onboarding process for your

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,190
team these are really the bare bones

00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,510
that you need in order to level the

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,429
playing field and make sure that

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,830
everyone joining gets an equal footing

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,809
in their first few weeks this is a

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,600
process that you never want to leave up

00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,820
to chance and while some of those steps

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,919
might seem like things to tackle later

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,179
on when you have your next hire there

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,269
are some things that you can start doing

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,950
today to get ready for that day whether

00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:37,049
you're a manager a team lead or an

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,659
engineer you can start by creating a set

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,490
of documentation for your codebase you

00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,620
can also create a team at Baikie friend

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,720
dawn code things like witch meetings are

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,730
actually meetings and what you don't

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,289
have to go to for example we have a

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,450
weekly Friday meeting booked on our

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,220
calendars to use as note space to write

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,200
out what we shipped over the week and we

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,789
don't actually physically meet and this

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,500
confuse new hires for a long time

00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,269
because we weren't writing it down and

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,070
so when we were in the office he was

00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,169
understood because people would see that

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,090
we weren't all sudden standing up to go

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,750
to a meeting but when we're working

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,830
remotely that context is not there and

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,760
lastly you can ask your team for

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,380
feedback

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,360
whether or not you had some kind of

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,280
official process everyone on your team

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,600
started at some point and they probably

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,390
have some thoughts on what could have

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,010
made the process easier ask them or send

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,780
out a survey and use that as a base

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,970
point to evaluate how you should be

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,800
setting this up this process will take

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,840
some time to build up from scratch and

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,570
you want to start basic before ramping

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,100
up to anything too complex eventually

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,050
you can start experimenting with things

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,540
like classes official meet and greet

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,730
sessions and what have you but remember

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,280
there is such a thing as too much

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,470
process if you have a company with ten

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,180
people you probably don't need to have a

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,760
week long process with classes and

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,920
instructors and a ton of structure start

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,360
small and build up as needed you will

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,040
still want to give people some

00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,770
flexibility and how they start out in

00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,480
their new job I hope that this talk has

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,550
sparked some ideas for how you can set

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,680
up or improve your own team's onboarding

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,900
process I'd love to hear about any

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,100
unique ways your onboarding people or if

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,050
you have any success and what I've

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,400
talked about today you can get in touch

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,700
with me through my Twitter handle

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,170
Alexandre ass underscore dev thank you

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,590
and I hope to see you all the next years

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,590
