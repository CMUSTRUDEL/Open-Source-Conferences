Hannah Stepanek

What’s an ORM? Is there a way to write database queries so that they are compatible with multiple types of databases? How do you make database changes (such as adding a new table or a new column) safely? What is a connection pool and why is it useful? What are some things that can go wrong when operating at scale? Is lazy loading slowing you down? In this talk we’ll take a deep dive into how the Python libraries SQLAlchemy and Alembic make managing production databases simple, efficient, and painless so you can get back to feature development.
