	Presented by:
Dr. Cristián Maureira-Fredes

Extending Python with C is a technique that many popular modules use for OS-level operations, serialization, performance, and more, but dealing with C code is not simple: you need to take care of memory, understand pointers, and write many lines of code for simple tasks. Luckily for you, there is C++.

Wait! Don’t be scared!

I know maybe you heard bad stories and saw complicated pieces of C code, but: are you aware of how C has been evolving?
The latest C++ standards include many goodies that smell a bit of Python, and I will show them to you.

During this talk, you will learn how to include C features into CPython modules, how to create hybrid applications**, and even to extend existent C applications with Python, making them scriptable**.

This talk is intended for developers who are familiar with Python and know basic C, but you don’t need to know any C++ to take the most out of it.
