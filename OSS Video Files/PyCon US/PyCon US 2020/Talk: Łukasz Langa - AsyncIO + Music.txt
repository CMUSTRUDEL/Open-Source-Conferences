Łukasz Langa

Can Python help a musician play hardware instruments? Is there anything specific about AsyncIO that makes it well suited to the task? Come see how AsyncIO can be used to aid music production and realtime performance through MIDI processing.

We will cover transformations of incoming MIDI signal, driving hardware instruments with a shared clock, as well as generative music. All production-grade.

If you’re curious about AsyncIO and wanted to see it in action in a unique setting, this talk is for you! Music theory knowledge not required.
