Publication date: 2021-05-05

Description: 
	Presented by:
Marlene Mhangami

In this talk, I will be outlining some of the unique aspects of being a young, female community leader in the budding Pan-African Python movement. I will begin by giving the audience an overview of the current state of the African Python community and my role in its development. I will then share some of my personal experiences, both positive and negative, leading in community spaces and juxtapose them to some philosophical ideas about leadership. I will be sharing some of my favorite philosophersâ€™ ideas on the topic, as well as some perspectives on how online communities have historically treated leadership. All of this information will be used, to make a proposition for how our community should view and identify leaders. I also go on to share how my personal and group identity as an African has played a large role in shaping how I lead. Our unique identities are incredibly significant, I argue that Pythonistas intending to build a more diverse and inclusive global community should be thoughtful about their identity. Finally, I will be sharing some anecdotes on what I believe the future leaders of our community should look like.
