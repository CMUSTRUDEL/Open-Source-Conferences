Title: Talk: Marlene Mhangami - Leadership and Identity in the Pan-African Python movement
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Marlene Mhangami

In this talk, I will be outlining some of the unique aspects of being a young, female community leader in the budding Pan-African Python movement. I will begin by giving the audience an overview of the current state of the African Python community and my role in its development. I will then share some of my personal experiences, both positive and negative, leading in community spaces and juxtapose them to some philosophical ideas about leadership. I will be sharing some of my favorite philosophersâ€™ ideas on the topic, as well as some perspectives on how online communities have historically treated leadership. All of this information will be used, to make a proposition for how our community should view and identify leaders. I also go on to share how my personal and group identity as an African has played a large role in shaping how I lead. Our unique identities are incredibly significant, I argue that Pythonistas intending to build a more diverse and inclusive global community should be thoughtful about their identity. Finally, I will be sharing some anecdotes on what I believe the future leaders of our community should look like.

hi everyone my name is Marlene and today

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,770
I'm gonna be speaking to you about

00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:13,920
leadership and identity in the

00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,740
pan-african Python movement so a bit

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,900
more about myself I am based in Harare

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,320
Zimbabwe which is actually where I am

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,179
right now and Zimbabwe is a country in

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
the southern part of Africa it's just

00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,900
about South Africa and it's sort of a

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,910
very turbulent country but I've lived

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,610
here for almost my entire life and I've

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,040
really enjoyed living here something

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,660
else about myself is that I am a

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,970
director at the Python Software

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,340
Foundation and this is gonna be my third

00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,190
year on the board of directors and I've

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,190
really enjoyed being part of the PSF and

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,350
I think we do really important work and

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,510
if you're watching this and you want to

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,180
know more information about the PSA

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,330
effort encourage you to visit Python org

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,310
to find out more and then a final thing

00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,759
about myself is that I'm the current

00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,280
chair of Python Africa and Python Africa

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,829
is the annual gathering of the

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,350
pan-african Python community on the

00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,530
continent of Africa and we actually had

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,799
our first conference last year in 2019

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,299
and we had it in Accra Ghana which is so

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,009
beautiful this is really exciting I was

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,780
able to chair this conference and be

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,079
part of the team that sort of led this

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,409
initiative and you know for me I found

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,079
that this was super super enjoyable but

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,179
at the same time quite challenging and I

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,770
also found that it was an opportunity

00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:45,749
for real personal growth for myself I

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,359
mean and you know simple things happened

00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:50,490
throughout the conference and throughout

00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,240
the planning of the conference that made

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,389
me stop and start to think about the

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,939
concept of leadership and specifically

00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:03,569
where we get our assumptions about what

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,270
a leader should look like so you know

00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:10,289
through office this planning process of

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,540
planning PyCon Africa I would be sending

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,970
emails quite often quite a lot and if

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,689
you are someone who's found a meet-up or

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,879
a conference

00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:18,319
you'll probably be able to relate to

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,450
that

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,750
but a lot of my my work was was

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,090
communicating with people and it was

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,920
really funny because when the conference

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,010
actually happened and I was there in

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,470
person several times I would go up to

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,329
people and I would introduce myself and

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,310
I'd say hi it's so nice to meet you in

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,879
person I'm Marlene I'm the person you've

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,340
been speaking to over email and you know

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,379
a couple of times I would go up to

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,650
people and say this and I would be met

00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:53,670
with like this sort of wide-eyed shock

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,430
or surprise where people would just be

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,220
like wow you're Marlene you're the

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,519
you're the conference here or other

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,079
times a couple of times I would go off

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,280
to someone and I'd be like hi I'm

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,829
writing in the conference chair the

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,500
person you've been speaking to you and I

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:13,440
just be made by you know sort of blatant

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,810
skepticism of your Marlene you're the

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,769
conference here are you sure are you

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,560
sure girl and I remember this one

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:26,069
specific moment as well where I went up

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,079
to someone and I introduced myself hi

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,989
it's so nice to meet you I'm Marlene and

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,370
the conference chair and this person

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,489
just looked at me and they were just

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,099
like wow you know Marlene you know I

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:43,669
just thought you would be bigger you

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:46,680
know not older not wiser just bigger and

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:51,599
you know that's I I think that's fair I

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,780
guess but this hasn't just happened to

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,269
me at PyCon Africa but there have been

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,430
other times in my life where I've been

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,609
put in positions of leadership and when

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,040
people find out that I am a person in in

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,620
leadership I think often times I

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,329
actually get a similar reaction and of

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,549
sort of surprised to find out that I'm

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:15,599
in any any sort of form of leadership

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:19,349
and these things happening you know have

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,199
led me to start to ask the question what

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:25,620
comes to our minds when we picture a

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,169
leader which actually leads me to my

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,289
first point today which is examining

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,809
leaders as

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,369
imagined beings so Aristotle has a

00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:35,619
really great quote where he says the

00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:37,539
soul never thinks without an image and

00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:40,869
I'd definitely have to agree with that

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:43,270
in fact in 2014 the New York Times

00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:45,550
published an article where they were

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,949
profiling a study done by a group of

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,020
researchers and in this study the

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:52,180
researchers would ask people to come

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,339
into a room and then ask them to draw

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,189
whatever came into their minds when they

00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:59,139
thought of the word leader and what came

00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:02,740
out of this study was really interesting

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:06,039
actually 9 out of 10 times when people

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,610
were asked to draw a leader they would

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,889
draw a man and the image that you can

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,569
see right now on this screen is actually

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:18,069
a picture that I pulled directly from

00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:21,689
that study and as you can tell I look

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:24,399
very similar to the person on the screen

00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,169
actually I'm I'm just kidding I look

00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,550
absolutely nothing like the person on

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,699
the screen will probably complete

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,039
opposites and one of the researchers

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,229
that was quoted in this article her name

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,080
is Elizabeth McLean and she's from the

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,959
University of Arizona she was quoted as

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,449
saying people have these prototypes in

00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,719
their heads about what a leader looks

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:49,569
like when we see an individual we ask do

00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:52,539
they fit that so where are we actually

00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:55,509
getting these persia' types from then is

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,099
anyone influencing the images that we

00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,769
have in our minds when we think about

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:02,199
leaders and so for this I'm going to

00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,519
actually take us back into history to

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,119
try and answer some of these questions

00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:11,069
so some of you may have heard about

00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:15,219
Plato Plato is a Greek philosopher and

00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:18,879
in you know he is Plato is very well

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:21,369
known for his concept of the philosopher

00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,800
king and he's also very well known for

00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:26,740
his writing the Republic and in the

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,839
Republic he actually puts across the

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,269
notion that leaders should be the

00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:35,139
smartest and most virtuous members of

00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:38,620
their communities and also in earlier

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:41,319
writings Plato is often found to use the

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,650
metaphor of leaders being shepherds to

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,580
their flocks

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,410
now Plato isn't the only person to have

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,540
used this metaphor we actually see it

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,570
being used in other ancient texts like

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,520
the Bible where Plato may have even

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:59,120
drawn this imagery from

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,710
in the first place however in a laser

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,430
writing Statesman place actually changes

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:11,680
his mind about this idea and he lets us

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:16,190
know that actually no we shouldn't use

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,560
the idea or the picture of shepherds to

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:23,180
help us imagine what our leaders should

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:27,650
be like because shepherds are humans and

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:30,380
sheep are sheep and so what this

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,720
metaphor does is it actually makes us

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,360
think that we are so different from our

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,460
leaders that were actually entirely

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,590
different our leaders are actually from

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,199
an entirely different species to us

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,289
oh I've tasted doesn't entirely reject

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,990
the idea or this concept of hierarchy

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:51,460
what we see is that he starts us on this

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,169
journey to start to break down this

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,060
romanticized idea of our leaders being

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,639
these perfect people who do no wrong

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,240
let's go ahead let's fast forward to

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,090
today we're living in 2020 barely making

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,210
it ready for living in 20 training

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,460
amulet and today we're living in what

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,190
many people were called the Information

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,810
Age and right now information is more

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,570
accessible than it's ever been before

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,030
and I would argue that as a direct

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,760
result of of that the gap between

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:27,160
leaders and their followers is smaller

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:31,580
than it's ever been before as well in

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,560
2018 even Chateauguay who is the creator

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,409
of a very cool functional programming

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,140
language called Elm gave a talk at a

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,450
conference called strange loop and the

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,040
title of his talk was the hardest part

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:49,100
of open-source and in his talk he was

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,470
examining why we have so much conflicts

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,650
in our online communities and one of the

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,279
major reasons he gave was that a lot of

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,970
our online communities were

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:02,100
actually founded on the ideology that we

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,519
can create this virtual space that's

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,620
free from tyrannies and free from some

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,930
of these negative dictatorships where

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,579
people in leadership sometimes don't

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,410
know as much as we do

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,899
but they're creating these rules and

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,809
structures that are oftentimes limiting

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,779
and in some ways can be very harmful and

00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,959
hurtful to communities and so many of

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:27,269
our online communities even today tend

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,839
to have a very negative view of

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:33,680
hierarchy and we also often see a

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,629
general distrust of people who try to

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,459
take positions of leadership and people

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:40,649
who try to set up structures or

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:43,740
hierarchies and so there's a very

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:47,189
negative view on people who are trying

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,749
to control other people online and

00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:53,189
that's something that I would definitely

00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:56,059
have to say I agree with so so far we've

00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:59,730
gone ahead and we've looked at two very

00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:01,920
extreme sort of perspectives on

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,500
leadership on the one hand we have this

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,449
idealized romanticized view of leaders

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,550
where we see them as these perfect

00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,680
people who can do no wrong and that's

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,839
not a good view of leadership because

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,110
we're really then just setting ourselves

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,819
up for disappointment because in reality

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,569
leaders are just normal people like you

00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:24,269
and me and then on the other hand we

00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:26,730
have this very negative perspective of

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,559
leaders where we see them as tyrants and

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,990
people who just want to create

00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,029
structures and control other people and

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,910
I also don't think that this is a great

00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,459
view because I do think leaders can be

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:42,899
really helpful especially when we try

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:47,329
and and start to set up communities in

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:50,759
different spaces as well so what is

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,249
actually a correct or good metaphor to

00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:57,149
use when we're thinking about leaders

00:10:53,249 --> 00:11:01,499
and you know I think that this is really

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:04,829
important to think about because if we

00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:07,139
don't have a correct view of leaders you

00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,940
could actually have a leader standing

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,700
right in front of you and

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,770
completely pass over that person because

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,590
they don't fit the prototype that's in

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:20,790
your mind right now

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:23,880
so for me I think I found a pretty good

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,780
metaphor that I personally would use to

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,390
describe leaders at this point I would

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,150
usually ask people to guess what that

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,520
metaphor is but you can go ahead

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:40,890
actually right now and guess what

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,930
picture I'm gonna use but for this to

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,050
answer this question I'm actually gonna

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:49,260
go back again to Plato when Plato

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,180
actually tells us that the picture or

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:56,450
the metaphor that we should use to

00:11:51,180 --> 00:12:01,980
describe leaders is to see leaders as

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:04,200
weavers so you know I feel like that was

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,980
such an obvious answer it's super

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,010
intuitive I'm joking it's I feel like

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,780
it's very nuanced concert but what I

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:19,140
mean by weavers is I mean people who

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:23,190
create fabric or create a garment out of

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:25,650
wool and Plato gives a really great

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,920
description of why we should see our

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:31,970
leaders as weavers and so for this we're

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:39,750
gonna go ahead and dive into the

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:42,330
exciting world of weaving so for weavers

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,880
when they're creating a garment usually

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,250
what they will do is they will take two

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,580
different types of wool of different

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,960
consistencies and the picture you can

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:57,600
see on the screen right now the type of

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,030
wood that is running horizontally across

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,060
the screen is called the whiffed and

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,160
that piece of wool is very soft and it's

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,400
sort of very malleable and kind of nice

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,740
to the touch and the wool that is

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,860
running vertically is called

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,339
the width and that piece is more

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:20,190
abrasive and kind of difficult to to

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,440
move potato lets us note that good

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,660
leaders are like weavers because

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Weaver's are able to do is they're able

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,910
to bring together two pieces of old that

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,880
are seemingly opposites and bring them

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,010
together to create one unified comment

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,570
and leaders are able to do a similar

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,240
thing

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,320
leaders do is they bring together people

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,020
from different perspectives and

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,810
encourage them to collaborate around one

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,980
unified cause so what I would say is

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,630
that good leaders are unifiers so at

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,860
first glance this can seem like

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,330
something that's pretty straightforward

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,330
this can seem like something that's

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,430
really easy to do but I would actually

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:06,030
argue that it's a lot more complex than

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,410
it seems and particularly today we're

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,290
living in a world that's really

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,420
globalized and in the Python community

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,430
Python is being used on every single

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,520
continent in the world

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:22,710
so from Africa to China to Alaska

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:26,970
shout-out to the Alaska Python user

00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:29,430
group Python is the Python community is

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,430
growing at a really rapid pace and this

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,080
is really exciting for us but at the

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,060
same time I also think that this is

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,150
something that is very challenging

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,670
because the larger our community grows

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,490
the different the more diverse the

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,710
perspectives become in our in our

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,490
communities and also the harder it is to

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,310
unify people around a common cause so

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,250
before I get into what it actually looks

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,170
like for us to be unifiers and to lead

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,630
in our communities I just want to make a

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,290
quick comment on things that unity is

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:07,500
not so the first thing is that unity is

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,200
not homogeny so I think many people

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,470
think that in order to be unified we all

00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,650
have to have the same perspective the

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,360
same ideas the same experiences and I

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,850
don't think this is true at all I think

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,410
we can come from different beliefs

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,820
different backgrounds different

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:30,300
experiences and still be unified in some

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,880
way so just a point here to note is that

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,760
unity doesn't mean we all look the same

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,850
and we all have the same perspectives

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,510
the same beliefs a second thing is that

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,220
unity is not just diversity so you can

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,430
have a really diverse group of people

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,620
together and maybe actually doing some

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,540
things together but that doesn't mean

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,310
that they're unifies just because you

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,410
have a really diverse looking group

00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:00,690
doesn't mean you have a unified group of

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,820
people so a couple months ago I found

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:06,960
this quote online and I thought it was

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:10,160
really moving and here it is and it says

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:14,180
diversity is about demographics

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:18,570
inclusion is about a sense of belonging

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,610
and I think when we are starting to have

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,100
these conversations about what it looks

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,260
like to be a unified community something

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,430
that we have to talk about is inclusion

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,170
because in order for people to feel like

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,540
they are part of a unified community

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,180
they has to have a sense that they

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,500
belong in that community and so

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,080
inclusion is a really big part of this

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,420
conversation and how do we make sure

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,450
that people feel like they belong in our

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,550
communities and I would argue that a big

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:52,800
part of that is understanding people's

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:54,720
identities so let's go ahead and and

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,270
talk a bit more about the subject of

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,710
identity so there's a philosopher a

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,840
modern-day philosopher his name is

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,240
Charles Taylor that is one of my

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,579
favorite philosophers and he has a book

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,190
called sources of the self the making of

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,500
modern identity and one of my favorite

00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:13,260
quotes from his book is the one on the

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,959
screen right now and he says in order to

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,680
have a sense of who we are we have to

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:23,160
have a notion of how we have become and

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,440
of where we are going so those two

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,990
things are really important really

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:33,360
crucial how we've become and where we're

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:36,600
going I'm gonna go ahead and share a bit

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,330
about my how and how I've become in

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,300
order to help us sort of examine this

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:46,650
issue of identity and how it plays out

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,160
in our communities so I mentioned before

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,370
that I am

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,520
horizon Bob way and that's where I've

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,680
grown up for most of my life but my

00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,930
mother though she lives here now

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,310
actually didn't grow up in Harare she

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,970
grew up in a different part of the

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:06,750
country called shi Shan Yu and my mother

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:12,480
when she was growing up

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:16,120
her family was very big so she had many

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,790
many many family members and the reason

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,750
for this is because her father or my

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:25,690
grandfather was a chief and my mother

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,120
didn't really know her father very well

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,680
and I didn't know my grandfather really

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,450
well because he actually died before I

00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:38,920
was born but for my mother her her

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:42,220
father was a polygamist so he had four

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,640
wives and my grandmother was actually

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,400
his fourth and final wife and I always

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,650
find that it's really interesting

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,660
whenever I talk to my mother and my

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,390
grandmother about their experiences

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,790
because it feels like they were living

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,460
in a world that's so different from the

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,710
world that I'm living in right now and a

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,990
picture of me that's on the screen right

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:10,510
now is actually from a couple of months

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:12,640
ago in the holidays when I went to my

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,940
mother's hometown and we had a reunion

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,940
from my mom's side where people all the

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,130
family members got together and during

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,590
that time you know it had been after a

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,080
period where I had gotten to travel

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,410
quite a bit and interact with people

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,020
from different communities and it was

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:35,740
really interesting because when I was

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,690
now there and at this family reunion I

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,480
noticed a number of different things

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:44,050
that my family does that are really

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,300
strange and that I was just like

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,300
actually in the places that I've been

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,980
people aren't doing these things and so

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,450
I'm gonna share a cup of those things

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:59,140
with you the first thing is tradition so

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,510
we're a pretty flexible family I would

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,030
say

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,120
but whenever we meet there is a lot of

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:07,550
tradition that's followed so for example

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,230
is a certain way that people have to

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,390
greet each other there's a way that men

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,880
greet and there's a way that women greet

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,560
and like you have to for the men there

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,240
has to be like a hand thing like this

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,920
for the women it's different and you

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,120
have to like curtsy and it's like a

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,970
funny it's like a whole thing but this

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,820
is really key to our identity so I'm

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,620
actually also part of a specific group

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,840
of Zimbabwean people called Shona people

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,870
and so a lot of the traditions that we

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,780
do it's that my tribe is the Shona tribe

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,450
and so a lot of the things that the

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,030
traditions that we follow right now have

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:47,030
been inherited from our tribal and

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:51,560
community or from from my tribal history

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:54,620
as a Shona person and another thing that

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,210
I don't know I think it might just be

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,460
specific to my family but I also have

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,070
seen it with a lot of Shona people where

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,530
they're singing and dancing and so

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,720
whenever we meet something I can

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,480
guarantee you is that there's gonna be

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,180
singing and there's gonna be dancing so

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,120
you know when we were going back for

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,300
this family reunion it had been a long

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:21,230
trip it's quite far from where I live in

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,880
her and so when we were we arrived at

00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,220
the place that we were staying

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,870
my grandmother was one of the first

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,450
people to get into the house and she

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:32,300
just dropped all her things and she

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,210
started singing and dancing and to be

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,910
honest I was very tired and I didn't

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,360
want to sing I didn't want to dance but

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:43,130
I have to sing and dance because

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,500
everyone just it's just what we do and

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,950
it's just I just don't think there's an

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,980
option I guess to say no but it was

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,590
always it's always fun and then a third

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,770
and final thing about us is food so we

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,810
have some traditional foods that we eat

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:03,260
astana people is involved we in people

00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:06,380
as well and one of the foods that we

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:11,150
have is is called sadza and it's kind of

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,240
like a it's like a starch substance it's

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,450
almost like

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:20,970
no I don't even know it's like nays and

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:23,880
you boil it and you know I've said for a

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,010
while now that I just don't think it

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,810
tastes really great I'm sorry to those

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,810
involved we ins watching to the Shona

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,080
people watching but it tastes ok it

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:39,270
tastes fine but I personally don't love

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:42,540
it but I'm eating salsa almost 2 to 3

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,900
times a week because it is part of our

00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,750
tradition and my mom gets really upset

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,240
when I complain about it and say that I

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,310
don't like it and it's just part of who

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:59,040
we are as Shona people another part of

00:22:53,310 --> 00:23:02,430
our tradition and so for me this these

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,230
parts of my personal identity when we

00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,700
were planning Pike on Africa and when

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,940
the conference actually happened I

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,410
actually really love to see the way that

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,150
my personal identity as a Zimbabwean

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:16,740
kind of played out

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:19,620
in and is also very similar to to a lot

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,150
of the traditional sort of identities of

00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,160
other people across the continent of

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,760
Africa and this played out in many

00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,420
different ways

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,970
at PyCon Africa itself so something that

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,310
we had for example it was as I said

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,580
before it was in Accra Ghana and so we

00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:39,990
had Ghanaian traditional food as part of

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:43,260
lunch at the conference so you know

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,120
there is some really I would say that

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,290
you know West African food is fantastic

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:53,460
but quite spicy jollof rice is a

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:56,760
favorite amongst ghanians and amongst

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,850
Nigerians and we had quite a lot of

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,970
jollof rice it's very spicy but I

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,700
enjoyed it and I loved that we had

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,760
traditional Ghanaians huge at our lunch

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,560
times another thing was that we had an

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,180
opening ceremony where they were singing

00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:17,490
and dancing throughout the conference

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:20,010
and I didn't know that the local

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,430
Ghanaian team had for the conference had

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,909
invited some g'day and dances to open up

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:28,779
the conference for us

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:32,259
and but it was a really amazing surprise

00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:34,330
and it was really fun to have he's got a

00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:38,830
Anton says they're at the conference

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:41,320
another thing as well is that to close

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,090
the conference someone gave a lightning

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,700
talk right at the end of the conference

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,979
and they were just like okay it's the

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,779
end of the conference I just think

00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:53,559
everyone should just calm down and

00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:56,139
Dawn's and this is he almost everyone in

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,840
that whole stood up and we started

00:24:56,139 --> 00:25:01,029
dancing and it was such a fun time and

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,269
it was something that I felt was so

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:07,690
unique to PyCon Africa and I'm not sure

00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:09,970
how well that would play out at a US

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,429
conference maybe I should try it the

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,669
next time I come but it was definitely

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:17,590
something that I felt made it feel like

00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:23,289
I was home and made it feel like I

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:25,960
belonged so like I said our history is

00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:30,009
really important how we've become our

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,109
history in our traditions our you know

00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:35,460
the things that make us are uniquely

00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:38,830
ourselves are really a key part of our

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,659
identity and really play a major part in

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,379
in terms of making us feel like we

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:48,159
belong however at the same time though

00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:52,119
our histories are important you know

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,549
does this mean that for our global

00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:56,830
community does this mean that I'm not

00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,950
gonna be able to feel like I belong in

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,950
your community unless you have people

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,989
dancing well if you have Ghanaian

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,090
traditional food I'm not gonna be able

00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:10,389
to feel like I belong in your community

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:13,179
No this obviously doesn't mean that and

00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:15,820
I would say that you know we should

00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:18,909
include our histories in our communities

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,979
as much as possible but that's not the

00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:23,379
only part of identities that we should

00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:26,080
take into consideration so let's look

00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:29,649
back at here we have on the screen again

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,179
that definition from sources of self yes

00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:35,109
our histories are a part of our identity

00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:37,690
but at the same time our futures are

00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:39,789
also a key part of our identity

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,799
so where we're going is a really key

00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,309
part of that and I would actually argue

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:48,700
for my third and final point that

00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:51,850
leaders are creators and leaders are the

00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,769
people who are creating the future so

00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,840
what does it look like what is our

00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:58,360
future actually going to look like and

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,840
how do we create that future as leaders

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,919
in our communities well you know for me

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,620
whenever I think about the word future

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,899
immediately an explosion of color is

00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:14,649
what comes to my mind I just think of

00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:17,470
really bright colors at the same time in

00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:21,659
line with that RGB values also come into

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:24,879
my mind and when we look at RGB values

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:27,340
what we know is that these were our UV

00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:29,679
values are primarily made of three

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,710
different colors so red green and blue

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,370
and in isolation these three colors are

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,860
beautiful and they are magnetic

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:41,259
magnificent just by themselves but what

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:45,070
we see is that the minute you start to

00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:49,769
mix and unify that red green and blue

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:52,809
you get a vast range of new colors and

00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:54,970
beautiful colors that we would not have

00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:57,039
seen otherwise

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,980
if these colors had just stayed in

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,370
isolation and today I'd like to propose

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,919
to you that the more diverse our

00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:09,580
communities are when we unify those

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,909
communities the potential for creativity

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,700
and innovation and discovery goes up

00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:17,500
significantly when we come together as

00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,809
people from different perspectives and

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,669
different backgrounds and experiences

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:24,009
and I think this is really important

00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:27,789
when we think about creating a future

00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:31,539
that is bright and colorful and meets up

00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:34,720
to all about expectations and so finally

00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:38,799
before I close I just want to make a

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,110
quick note and what I think the future

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,299
leaders look like what do our leaders of

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,750
the future look like how do we identify

00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:51,220
those people and I think there are three

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:54,190
key parts or three key traits that

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,409
leaders of our future have so the first

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,750
thing is I think they're curious these

00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:01,240
are people who are going out of their

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,549
way to find out about what other people

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,650
believes to find out about other

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,580
people's traditions and cultures and

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:12,250
they are curious they are going even to

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,470
places that don't make them feel

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:18,010
comfortable or places that are really

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:21,070
new just to find out about other people

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:24,370
and I think a second thing is that our

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:27,070
future leaders are humble so not always

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,350
having to make sure that your opinion is

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:33,580
the loudest and your opinion is the one

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,350
that's being taken all the time I think

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,120
good leaders are sometimes they also be

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,940
in situations with people that they

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,010
disagree with and I still be humble

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,980
enough to collaborate with those people

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:48,190
and then the third and final thing is I

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,280
think good leaders are open so not just

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,260
listening and learning from other people

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,140
but being vulnerable and being able to

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,419
share your own experiences with people

00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,640
from different backgrounds and I think

00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:03,179
that way we're able to build empathy and

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,260
build stronger and more unified

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:09,960
communities so that's it for my talk and

00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,360
thank you so much please feel free to

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,370
follow me on Twitter or message me if

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,000

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,000
