Publication date: 2021-05-05

	Presented by:
Conor Hoekstra

Refactoring can lead to absolutely beautiful code. Not only this, but the refactoring itself can be a thing of beauty. This talk demonstrates taking an example with a double-digit number of lines of code down to a single-digit number of lines of code. This talk will show how to identify certain anti-patterns that can be replaced with more expressive and declarative code. This is a simple talk that can be understood by all, but when applied to oneâ€™s daily work can make a significant difference.
