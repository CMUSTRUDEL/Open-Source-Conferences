So you’ve finished the DjangoGirls tutorial, but now you want to share it with the outside world, but how do you go about that?

What even is production? What is the deal with web servers versus web service gateway interfaces? And static, what’s that, then? What is involved in choosing a platform or infrastructure as a service? What even are databases?

In this presentation, we will discuss the basics beyond running a Django project locally, and discuss the concepts and strategies around how to deploy your project, ultimately answering the question, “What is deployment, anyway?”
