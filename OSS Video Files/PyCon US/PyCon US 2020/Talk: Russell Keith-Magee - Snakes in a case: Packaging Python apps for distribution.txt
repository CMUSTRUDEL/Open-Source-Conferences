So you’ve written a Python program - a game, a new social media app, or a system administration utility. You think it’s great, and you want to share it with the world. But how do you do that? How do you distribute your code to others without needing to document how to set up Python, install dependencies, and run your application?

In this talk, you’ll learn about Briefcase, a tool that can convert a Python project into platform-native installers on macOS, Windows and Linux - and can also target iOS and Android. You’ll learn how to use Briefcase to start a new project, or convert an existing project for distribution. You’ll also see how Briefcase (and some other recent developments in the Python ecosystem) can assist you during application development.
