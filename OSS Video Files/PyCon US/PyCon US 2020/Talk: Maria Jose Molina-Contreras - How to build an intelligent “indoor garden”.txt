Title: Talk: Maria Jose Molina-Contreras - How to build an intelligent “indoor garden”
Publication date: 2021-05-05
Playlist: PyCon US 2020
Description: 
	Presented by:
Maria Jose Molina-Contreras, phD

Most people around the world are getting more and more interested in living a long and healthy life nowadays. And many studies have proven that growing house plants, as long as being a trend, improves health.
The truth is, we are so busy with work, and even when we get home, that we do not have enough time to properly water our plants when they need it.

In this talk, you are going to learn how to build a functional and beginner friendly system to keep your plants alive using different sensors, microcontrollers and CircuitPython.

This system is going to water your plants based on their necessities and, step by step, you are going to add components and functionalities to the system; for instance, you will give your plants “a voice” to inform you about their deficiencies.
Moreover, in this project, you will learn how to create a Web application with Flask, how to set up a Raspberry Pi as a local server and how to use a cloud IoT service for Data Analysis.

Finally, you will see how Circuitpython can play an amazing role in these kind of situations, by helping plants to survive longer, and by making our responsibility lighter. This will also help you to understand that it is an excellent choice to start programming hardware and connected devices for everyone!

hello everyone today we would like to

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,789
talk about how to build and intelligent

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,390
indoor garden but before jumping into

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,839
the talk a few words about me I have a

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,650
long name but just call me Miriam I did

00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,860
the PhD in plant biology and four years

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,300
ago I moved to Berlin with a lab full of

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,519
dreams and planning to start a new life

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,280
it was a hard moment but thanks to the

00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:47,820
support from the by the Berlin Python

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,710
community I was able to keep up this

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,140
allowed me to find a new professional

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,199
path as a data scientist and not only

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,960
that I also started to use Python for

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,079
doing experiments at home

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,719
this talk is an example of that I wanted

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,330
to thanks to the Python community for

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:12,330
its support and for believing in me so

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,149
keep in mind that sharing is caring so

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,149
let's all share our knowledge and

00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:20,209
support more people to include more and

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:24,720
more people to this beauty-full

00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:28,229
community the project that I will talk

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,800
about this one that held my apply my

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:35,599
friend plants because of my background

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:39,000
in plant and my knowledge in Python I

00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:44,280
decided to start playing with a whole

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,140
new topic microcontrollers the world was

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:53,130
clear build the simplest and functional

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,459
plan watering system so people without a

00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,209
software or hardware background could be

00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:03,300
able to reproduce it at home of course I

00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:08,550
wanted to also motivate new people to

00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:11,370
jump into into Python while doing

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,220
biological experiments I never had the

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:19,410
chance to program any hardware so I have

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,439
no knowledge at all but likely a friend

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,240
of mine went to the Python 2018 and got

00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,590
a micro

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:30,650
and he gave me gave it to me and told me

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:34,130
you're gonna love these

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:40,520
check these microcontroller and I

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:42,500
remember that I answer to that like but

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,700
I don't know how to use it

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,480
can I break it oh good

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:56,510
do you what I need to install I need to

00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:00,050
so there's something he told me just

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:04,390
connect it to your laptop it has Python

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:07,850
inside and take a look to the keynote I

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:12,490
was so impressed and how simple things

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:17,690
were I'm the keynote by Nina was so cool

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:22,310
that that I start to sink or new project

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:24,080
ADR right away and wasn't that moment to

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,040
say okay it's clear

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:33,410
I mean I know that I need to develop

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:40,670
this watering system and now I have the

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:43,610
key and how to do it but what is the

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:46,310
most important when you are starting a

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:52,720
project hello

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:58,430
no it's a joke I starting to develop and

00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:02,930
the project in the right way but also I

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:08,170
started to draw the projected image for

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:12,080
farm and I ended up with plant areas

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,890
because I thought that it was so kind of

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:21,109
funny with the same time cute and it's

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:25,330
kind of the image of this project well

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:29,060
let's stop talking about the law and

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:33,110
let's go and review some important

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,189
concepts before to start building the

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,159
watering system

00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:43,240
um honestly sometimes it's hard to keep

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:50,740
our plants happy and the watering is key

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:54,189
here but it's not the only one first

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,870
thing choose your plants based on your

00:04:54,189 --> 00:05:04,780
environment towel condition is key to

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:07,990
have success naturally most plants are

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,180
from outdoors but if they did create an

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:16,000
indoor garden you need to have in mind

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:21,370
hours of light consider in a synthetic

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:27,279
light take care of the temperature the

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:33,430
relative humidity and orientation of

00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:37,569
your house but it's not the only factor

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:41,139
that we need to have in mind we also

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:48,490
consider the moisture sensor we need to

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:51,000
know who is our power plant soil and how

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,669
to measure the moisture of the soil

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,389
there are many types of sensors but I

00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:02,620
just try two of them a resistive and are

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,810
capacitive I try as a resistive even

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,500
knowing that they are they have

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,979
corrosion problems because it was for

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,779
shorter water as position but if you

00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:18,849
need to leave it all the time use a

00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:24,400
capacitive for that reason you're gonna

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:27,099
see that in some moments I use the first

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:32,740
one and in other moments I use the

00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:36,789
second option to get a correct reading

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,789
out of your soil moisture sensor it is

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,460
recommended that you first calibrated

00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:46,930
for the particular type of soil that you

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,060
plan to monitor because

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,949
different types of soils can affect the

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:56,889
sensor so your sense or maybe maybe more

00:06:53,949 --> 00:07:00,610
of less sensitive depending on the type

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:03,039
of soil that you use and of course the

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:07,360
first thing to do before start the

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:11,620
project is take for example in this case

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:17,770
I did took three classes with water with

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:22,090
soil pretty wet and also try soil and I

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:28,780
went measuring the values from one to

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:31,479
another always from dry to wet and the

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,699
end then you need to do experiments and

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:43,500
take numbers to define what is dry and

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:47,919
what is wet in numbers per parameters

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:53,139
it's only thing now who showed you water

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:58,590
your plan well if I ask you which is the

00:07:53,139 --> 00:08:01,780
current method a B or C the answer is

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:05,620
depends of the species and the stage of

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:09,310
development not all the plants like the

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:13,840
same water method and maybe you are

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:16,690
wondering but why well an important

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,510
factor is the root distribution a plan

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,389
with superficial fruit prefer a method a

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:27,449
apply with deep throat a B and C are

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:31,289
fine the method a can produce additional

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:35,770
aeration of the soil loss in minerals

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:38,560
the method B sometimes is not enough for

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:43,260
the plan receive Allah if the plan

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,260
receive a lot of direct Sun

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:52,510
tentatively the two methods could be

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:56,680
could be a great idea that it's the case

00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:00,610
see to have a good mineral watering

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:04,860
balance but let's start

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:09,279
considering the method a and or be for

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:12,670
our watering system yeah

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,750
after this consideration we can go to

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:20,950
the sign our prototype that is go tell

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:25,930
it after have all these things clear on

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:30,610
the finite the I design my probe my

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,560
first prototype that was that here you

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,620
can see the initial idea that they have

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,920
in mind I thought okay I have my plan

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,860
with a moisture sensor connected to the

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,310
microcontroller and also a water pump

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:50,260
that somehow connectivity actively do

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:54,700
water it it looked at really simple so I

00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:00,220
started to read about how to do this and

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:06,240
I started to buy some components but in

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,240
some cases were a lot of components here

00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:14,470
are roughly all the elements I use it

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,449
for the first system the microcontroller

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,990
I goes from the back one is that the

00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:22,510
bottom life it's other F the moisture

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,750
sensor is a flower shape a device that

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:30,010
you see in see the water pump is a white

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,230
thing in the middle that needed the

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:38,130
sternal batteries in this case is five

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:42,399
balls so that you can see in letter e

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:46,470
the blue think on the top it's a relay

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:51,040
in simple words that it's a signal

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:55,209
on/off switch so I was able to connect

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,720
that to control when I was watering and

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:04,540
of course some cables to connect the

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:07,410
different parts the microcontroller that

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:12,460
I use it is called sacred playground

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:15,010
express and it's a lot by other fruit

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,890
this microcontroller has a huge

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:21,600
potential for different kind of project

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:27,190
because has motion temperature live

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,980
sound sensor and much more the Python

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,250
version that runs inside is called silk

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,690
with Python which is a four from micro

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,750
Python and it's really simple to yours

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:43,260
totally beginning penal friendly there

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,960
are many libraries and drivers for

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,380
sensors and you can connect it with a

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,970
USB cable and then you are able to start

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,690
a Python console to interact with it it

00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,190
was amazing

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:04,180
here you can see how everything was

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:09,670
connected at the end many cables I know

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:13,720
I need safe to have the palm next to the

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:17,770
relay I know also that but never mind

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,760
this was just to show you in a picture

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,930
the place than with at home let's be

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,940
safe

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:31,250
try try it on do it well let's see how

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:45,420
the system work in a video

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:45,420
[Music]

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:55,740
and what about the coat well I skip the

00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:57,680
import here's but I just wanted to show

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,350
you how to interact with the devices

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,230
since I was sending signals to the relay

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,809
I had a digital output connection and

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:10,339
the moisture sensor is an analog input

00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:14,069
since I needed to read a number from it

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:17,399
the main lobe was really simple you get

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:20,189
the sensor Palio and if that's less than

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,189
the Triborough you define it

00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:27,689
jusers enabled relay and the world and

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:28,879
water the plan for a few seconds easy

00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:32,610
right

00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:37,970
you can find the code in github account

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,970
in case that you want to play around

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:49,319
after I finish this project or this this

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:52,199
approach I give a couple of told many

00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:58,009
people was interested and I start with

00:13:52,199 --> 00:14:04,139
me he gave me feedback and ask me for

00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:07,170
new functionalities and so I so I

00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:12,720
decided to build a bigger system with

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:15,269
many more features since that's real

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,240
quick click down Express didn't have

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:21,000
many ports iPhone another device that

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,600
the standard connection so I have the

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,230
option to add more things as you can see

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:35,040
here I included in my sister my speaker

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:38,059
and also water level sensor here are the

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:44,720
components the old and the new computer

00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:49,649
component allure D the green circuit

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,050
that it under the sacred playground is

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:55,769
called Cricut and include

00:14:52,050 --> 00:15:00,269
extract ports to connect more things to

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:04,709
your sacred playground I also bought a

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:08,459
speaker and I put it inside a box yeah I

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:11,130
don't show up you can see the red the

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:16,920
red water level sensor with this letter

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:21,149
B and of course we have also the old

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:25,860
component like the fillet the batteries

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:31,560
the water pump and and the moisture

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:34,740
sensor in grid letter C as you can see

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,339
for this project I use the capacitive

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,339
one

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:58,019
these filled water container

00:15:50,540 --> 00:16:01,419
[Music]

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:05,410
attention the water level is low please

00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:08,949
fill the water container here

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:12,369
it's the code with a little bit longer

00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:16,299
but it's still simple enough to for

00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:18,669
everyone that wants to try I wrote a

00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,029
python class to keep all the

00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:24,160
functionalities of the system so the

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:28,239
first thing I do is to create an object

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,929
called plant arrays the main loop had

00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:33,759
some steps so on the right you can see

00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:39,069
the implementation of the functions

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:42,609
first you can see that the method the

00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:44,980
method water level okay does something

00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:48,819
similar that we did in the system one

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:53,019
just check the value and return true or

00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:56,939
false when the level is not okay we play

00:16:53,019 --> 00:17:01,149
a message there there I am just opening

00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:04,899
wealth file and play it through the

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:07,959
speaker so that's all you need to have a

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:14,559
voice notification if the water level is

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:17,289
low the second condition we have is to

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,860
check if the moisture value is okay this

00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:24,130
is the same code from the system plan I

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:28,179
check if the moisture level is okay and

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:31,240
if not I would hurt out my plan here

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,450
what having our plant is just opening

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:38,500
that relay for a few seconds and then

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,519
close it if you are thinking there is a

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,679
mistake

00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:47,309
because for opening I wrote false that

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,460
it's because there really has to estate

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:55,600
always close or always open since I

00:17:51,460 --> 00:18:01,059
don't want to have the water pump the

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:04,659
water pumping all time I use it the

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:08,230
always closed gate so that's needs to be

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:11,049
true to remain always closed

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:19,059
that the skywriting Falls means that the

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:24,400
relay will be open here

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:27,490
of course here is not the full code you

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:34,780
can find the code team in the github

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:38,590
account as I was generating a lot of

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:41,020
data I decided to do something about it

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:48,130
and I thought hmm

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:50,500
I shall connect my system to Internet so

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,299
I start to look for components that the

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,120
cool help me with that

00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:57,790
and I noticed a new system by alfred

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,760
called pi portal so i went into the

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:04,410
store and got it to start playing with

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:11,470
it's a very interesting component with

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:18,460
that allowed you to have Ayyad and also

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:23,080
has a screen it's super cool but even I

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,480
even throw I did my best I had I had

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,929
many issues with connecting components

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,780
to the device probably because of my

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:35,770
little experience but they spent a lot

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:41,380
of time reading about GST connectors I -

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:45,280
I to see pores and even Wi-Fi microchips

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:50,470
I'm a stele of your in out the voltages

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:53,250
of the of those things but that story

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,070
for another talk or for another moment

00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:03,130
but still I think that it's a really

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:05,950
interesting component or or gadget and

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,520
please if you have a spirit with my

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:15,850
portal be let's be in touch because I

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:19,990
want to include it in in my system but

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:23,770
as I had some things on

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:27,980
difficulties and I wanted to improve my

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:34,420
system - with IOT including I got I

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:39,970
found another path and I was very lucky

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:44,000
because when I was looking for options

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,880
without pie ladies from the lane and

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,090
Hamburg decide to organize a worship

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,750
after the pie conde on the same topic

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:59,900
and guess what I got

00:20:52,750 --> 00:21:02,929
lassparri pie it was awesome the base

00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:08,570
system of my pie is raspbian and I

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:12,890
couldn't to eat the ss8 so I was able to

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,620
install Python but then I thought that I

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:19,429
could install many other things so what

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:24,380
I gotta find live a web server running

00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:26,990
on the PI so I didn't have to worry more

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:31,580
about the limited storage just based on

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:34,640
the system since I had the SD car of my

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,400
PI so I start to check how they connect

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,590
the Raspberry Pi and the

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:44,690
microcontrollers and iPhone app I cereal

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,240
to be completely honest with you I

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,600
started to try different code phone

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,280
around and I ended up having a way to

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,120
get all the prints from the

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,480
microcontroller to assist me well and

00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,480
that

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,260
attention the water level is low please

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:18,670
fill the water container

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:18,670
[Music]

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,250
sense at some point I did some flash

00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:31,450
tutorials I had some experience setting

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,640
up a simple web application so if you

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:37,000
consider that I'm currently working with

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:41,530
Hayden it was an easy decision to build

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,840
a monitor system yeah you can see and

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:47,560
they mad that I am displaying the logs

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,220
on a table and on the right you can see

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:54,910
the moisture data over time plus the

00:22:51,220 --> 00:23:00,870
lastest report of the device and a small

00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:05,530
table on top as you can see the the

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:13,300
decrease on the plot means that the plan

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:15,820
was great it was amazing okay that was

00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,570
nice but when I start to read about how

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:23,530
to access my Raspberry Pi from outside

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:26,410
my home things got really complicated I

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:29,140
asked many people and even though I

00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:34,780
managed to do it with a service called

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:39,220
no no API I didn't feel safe since

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:43,180
protecting the site or the server was

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:46,840
too difficult so I thought how else I

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,900
can access it through internet without

00:23:46,840 --> 00:24:00,960
setting up something too complicated

00:23:49,900 --> 00:24:00,960
oh sorry I have a message

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:16,639
oh let's see it's plant eyes okay

00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:16,639
the data looks good

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:40,470
let's see what happened at home okay one

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,290
looks good

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:47,470
telegram I was using the lay down for a

00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:50,559
long time I nine and I knew that in

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,190
theory it was easy to set up about and I

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,070
had some friends that had one so he went

00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:00,760
a line and tutorial was really simple

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:04,090
you talk to the bot father telegram tell

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:09,130
him that you want a new board that's all

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:12,910
he gives you are talking and of course I

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,520
so help me again since there is a model

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:20,169
to add functionality to your bottom

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,140
Python as you can see in the slide and

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:30,700
that was the story hope and that is was

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:32,799
also about there are many many crazy

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,559
ideas on topic that I want to start

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,500
researching but of course grunting at

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,679
time at the moment and I'm trying to

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,650
understand where the PI portal bursts

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:50,200
since I am certain having a screen will

00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:52,960
improve the system a lot but also I am

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,809
thinking if I should buy a scream for

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,620
the Raspberry Pi and try to integrate it

00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:04,120
to my system but it's something that I

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:08,740
need to think with time also I am

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,620
stealing a couple of Nayla bite of datum

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,740
so I don't believe our tau series will

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:19,360
improve my current situation but in some

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:22,419
case I have reviewed a couple in case I

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:27,000
need a better infrastructure I try

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:31,590
Google Cloud storage and a la fruta oh

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,559
let's see what happened in the future

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:38,429
but at the moment I think that I don't

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,429
need it

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:46,240
because of the quarantine I was unable

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:52,179
to build the shellfish structure that I

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:59,340
desired but believe me that it will be

00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:59,340
prepared so currently I'm working in an

00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:06,820
efficient watering system using a

00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:10,570
parallel system with all the relays and

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,600
moisture sensors you can see on the

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:19,360
right parallel system that is still a

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:22,779
prototype but is coming so I already

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,879
have like two or three talked a year so

00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:29,049
keep an eye I will try to communicate

00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:31,600
all the new things on Twitter believe me

00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:35,919
I am prepared science I have many

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:40,360
sensors and I haven't had the time to

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:43,419
even try them hopefully you come by a

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,559
couple of component get the cold and

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:51,070
start playing with it and but the most

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:55,600
important thing is let's make our plants

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,730
happy thanks for watching my talk I hope

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,779
now you are motivated to start

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:05,019
automating more system it's at home with

00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:07,980
your plants and if you have more some

00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:11,200
