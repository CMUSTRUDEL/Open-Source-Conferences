Title: TALK   Yetunde Dada   Reproducible and maintainable data science code with Kedro
Publication date: 2021-05-29
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	Code produced by data scientists is under attack! There are a growing series of conference talks, Medium blog posts and business stakeholders telling a story of how changing business objectives are driving interest in production-level code. Production-level code is considered time-consuming to produce and limiting for the experimentation process needed to create amazing models. You're going to follow a workflow that deconstructs your experimentation workflow in a Jupyter notebook and helps you create production-ready ML pipelines. The talk is focused on an open source Python framework, called kedro that emphasises creating reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code.
