Title: TALK   Shemra Rizzo   Learning python during lockdown: a surprising bonding experience with my child
Publication date: 2021-05-29
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	Do you remember what it was like when you first started to code? Do you remember feeling frustrated and discouraged or even wanting to give up? What would you say to yourself if you had a chance to go back in time and talk to your beginner self? Unfortunately, traveling back in time is not possible, but we can always share our experiences and advice with those who are just getting started.

The pandemic lockdown coincided with my teenager taking his first python courses remotely. I had the opportunity to witness the beginning of his path as a python programmer and to serve as an encouraging mentor. I demystified the programming process and created realistic expectations. Meeting four times a week to discuss and practice python for many months proved to be a surprising and amazing bonding experience with my child.

In this talk I will cover the main topics we discussed during our meetings, which were all the things I wish I had known when I was first starting to code.
- Programming is not memorization. It is problem solving.
- Don’t jump straight into coding, use lots of scratch paper and pseudo code to understand your problem and design your solution.
- Make sure your code does what it’s supposed to do. Test it.
- Getting stuck and making mistakes is normal. Debugging is not a sign of failure.
- Don’t learn isolated. Find a mentor and join a community.

I hope that after this talk you will be inspired to become a mentor, support others and share your experience with those that are starting their programming journey in python.

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,600
hi

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,000
my name is chambra rizzo and i am a

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
senior data scientist at genentech

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,240
my most recent work has been on studies

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,320
of covid19

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,960
and using data-driven approaches to

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,399
evaluate eligibility criteria for cancer

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
clinical trials

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,559
as a data scientist i use python every

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
day for data cleaning

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,640
data manipulation data analysis and

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
machine learning

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
today i will be talking about my

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,239
experience

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
mentoring my son who started learning

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
python during lockdown

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,480
something that to my surprise proved to

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,480
be a very rewarding experience

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,160
do you remember what it was like when

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,719
you first started to code

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
perhaps you imagine it would go like

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
this

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,159
but quickly felt discouraged and

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,080
frustrated

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,560
i know my own journey definitely felt

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,320
like this at times if you have been

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
programming for a while

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,439
what would you say to yourself if you

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
had a chance

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,680
to go back in time and talk to your

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,479
beginner self

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
unfortunately traveling back in time is

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
not possible but we can always share

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,600
our experiences and advice with those

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,240
who are just starting

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,159
and this is the opportunity that i was

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,200
given

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,680
okay so a little bit of context last

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,799
year

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,320
as we all know covet 19 was officially

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,799
declared a pandemic

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
in california we received notices to

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
shelter at home

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,119
on march 19th being under lockdown

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
affected everyone in our family

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,280
differently

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,880
my oldest son in particular had to

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
finish his senior year of high school

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,040
online

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
classes became easier but without the

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
social component

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
it was a really sad way to finish high

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,039
school

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
i personally like college much better

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,560
than high school

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,680
so i cheered him up by telling him that

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,400
the best was yet to come

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,200
unfortunately this also didn't happen

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
the pandemic got out of control and many

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,040
universities became remote for this

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,280
academic year sheltering at home

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
being in lockdown was the right thing to

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
do in a pandemic

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
from a public health and population

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
perspective

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
but at the personal experience level

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,920
like in this case

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,360
it sucked so in the fall

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,480
my son started college online he has

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,959
actually never been to this campus his

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,599
intended major is computer science

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
professors and tas are all making a big

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,480
effort to make it work

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,680
to provide material and the knowledge

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,680
but missing out on the social aspect

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,000
is what makes the experience very rough

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
based on my personal college experience

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,959
the academic and social aspects

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
sometimes go

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
hand in hand for example i have

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,360
very pleasant memories of working on

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,000
homeworks

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,720
and studying for exams until very late

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
at night

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,319
with a close group of friends while

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
going through some of the hardest

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,720
classes

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
i remember explaining concepts that i

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
understood to others

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
and also having things explained to me

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
this dynamic

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
was particularly important for me at the

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,879
beginning

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,080
during my first two years of college so

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,120
i was sad and i'm still sad that my

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,920
son didn't get to experience this

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,760
one of his first classes was python 101

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,000
that wasn't the exact name but it

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,400
effectively is what it is

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
a class meant to showcase the language

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
capabilities

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
and bring real challenge to the students

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
it was meant to give them a taste of

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,959
real programming

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,959
by having them solve problems and

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,280
projects that on one hand

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
cover all the python fundamentals but

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320
also had a clear purpose

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,160
like building a sudoku solver or

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
take derivatives of mathematical

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
expressions

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,080
or perform motion detection etc

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,919
it was hard from the slack and discord

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,479
conversations it was clear

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,120
that most students were struggling my

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600
son

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
started his class doing stuff by himself

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
that he had

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,000
done during high school but after a few

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
homeworks it wasn't going so well

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
he was crushed his efforts felt like

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
they weren't enough

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
without pierce to commiserate his

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
confidence tanked

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,680
and his mind ran to worst case scenarios

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,000
why am i studying computer science

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,039
clearly i am not good at this

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,440
i should be a writer or a game designer

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,039
and he started reading on how to switch

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,120
majors

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,639
does this sound familiar it sounded

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,039
familiar to me

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
when i was studying my phd one of my

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,520
hobbies was

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,000
daydreaming about quitting and about

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,160
having alternative careers that were as

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,720
far from stem as possible

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
i actually bought and read books on how

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
to be

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,759
a screenwriter

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:36,800
an illustrator a children's book author

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,600
and a photographer i didn't quit my phd

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
i succeeded and even won financial

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
awards to support my dissertation

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,039
writing

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
i didn't want him to quit his major at

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
least

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,840
not at this point i knew i could

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
definitely be of help

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,199
and that i could have a positive impact

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,800
in his trajectory

00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:00,800
after all every day for me starts like

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
this the areas i saw i could clearly

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
help

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,120
were on how to approach problems and on

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
setting realistic expectations

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,319
i wanted to be a mentor that would guide

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,120
him to success

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,039
to success in this particular class so

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
we set our routine to meet four times a

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,479
week

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,720
to talk about his python programming

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,520
we would review what he was stuck on and

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,319
discuss

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
and discuss how he would get himself

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,080
unstuck

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,720
in our conversations we kept converging

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,000
to the following themes

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,880
and i will go one by one so

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
the first one programming is not

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,280
memorization

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,880
google is your friend being new to

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,319
python into programming

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,960
we clarify that programming is unlike

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
any of the other classes or fields of

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
study

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,039
sure at the beginning you

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,319
might need to memorize some syntax

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,759
but the truth is that even this happens

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,280
organically

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,199
if you are consistent in your

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,199
programming practice

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
the more you use it the more familiar it

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
becomes

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,639
consistency is the most important thing

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,880
when learning a new language

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
this is true for any natural language

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,080
including french

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,880
or spanish in our case this was easy

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,520
given that the class comes with a prefix

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
schedule

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,479
of homeworks and projects but for others

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,759
that are learning python on their own

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,680
like i did

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
it is important to commit to practice

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,160
daily

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,039
second google is your friend googling

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,120
for answers

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
doesn't necessarily work in other

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,199
classes

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
for example in math if you are trying to

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
prove a theorem

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,680
you are armed with the theorems that

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
you've learned so far

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,440
and then you have to come up with

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
creative ways to connect them

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
to build your proof if you're stuck it

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
is

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,479
very unlikely that a google search could

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,039
help

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,000
in programming as you are working on new

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,160
challenges

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
there will always be coding details that

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,479
you either can't remember

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,520
you can't quite figure out or you simply

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,080
don't know

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,039
luckily python is an extremely popular

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,720
language

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,199
that has been around for around three

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,599
decades and is open source

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
there are extensive resources

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,479
documentation

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,560
forums and the answers to any question

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,520
are almost always one google search away

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,000
i was very open with my son about how

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
much i rely on the community

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
the resources and the support online

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,440
every single day

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,440
to get my code up and running asap

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,959
here are some of the things that i

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,640
googled this past week

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,839
python pandas crosstab with missing data

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,080
python print large output without

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,519
ellipsis python remove multi-level index

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,200
after pivoting table and lots of daytime

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,720
manipulation questions i also google

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,760
every weird error and warning that i get

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,399
my google searches usually lead to

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,680
the popular community-based forum stack

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,920
overflow

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,959
sometimes i find the answer to my

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
question right away

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,600
and i copy-paste it the few times that i

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,760
couldn't find my answer

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
at least i got some useful ideas

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,560
all right so now

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,600
don't jump straight into coding sketch

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,640
first once we got comfortable with not

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
knowing

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
we could look into solving problems

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,440
except that first

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,640
i insisted on not coding right away

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,040
not yet sketching the problem

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,040
and solution in a piece of paper is

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,680
something that i have found

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
extremely useful every time i needed to

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
solve a problem

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
in any technical field that i've been a

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,200
part of in physics

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,480
in math in statistics and in data

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
science

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
so while it's very tempting to jump into

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
coding

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,480
there are several advantages to spend

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
some time at the beginning

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
creating a visual representation of the

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,920
problem and the solution

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,920
first it can help you define the problem

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,320
clearly to yourself

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,680
sometimes you think that you get it from

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
just reading about it

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,720
but once you draw it you realize that

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
there are

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,600
some nuances second

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,200
it facilitates the brainstorming

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
solutions and allows you

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,279
to visualize different approaches to

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
solve the problem

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,360
sometimes it also allows you to see

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,480
patterns

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,200
and it definitely saves time because it

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
avoids

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,040
writing a bunch of throwaway code

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
my son assumed that this was some sort

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,160
of beginner's technique

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,279
but it isn't i don't sketch every time i

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
clean data or

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
run a simple model because i've done it

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,120
hundreds of times

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,760
but i still find plenty of opportunities

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,760
to use my scratch paper

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,959
recently i needed to develop an

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,800
algorithm to identify

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,560
hospitalizations out of medical records

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,360
if you have worked with medical records

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
before

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
you know that they are very messy one

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
thing that i found

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
is that there were sometimes overlapping

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,800
records

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,040
for the same patient so my objective

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,120
was to extract the start and the end

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,920
date of the hospitalization

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,279
and with a simple sketch as this one the

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,040
one in the top

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,720
i was able to visualize in one spot

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
all of the possible overlapping

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,079
scenarios that my code

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,920
needed to account for and that way

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,680
no single case escaped me sketching

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
also allowed me to have a plan for

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
scenarios that i had not initially

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
considered

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
for example if a patient spends the

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,639
night in the er

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,240
does that count for the hospitalization

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,600
length

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,440
if i see a one day gap does that really

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,720
mean that they were discharged and

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,839
readmitted within 24 hours

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,519
and what would i do if the end date is

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
missing

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,200
well i would pull information from other

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,680
sources that give me

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,959
evidence of presence in the hospital on

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
consecutive days

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,800
which is a whole other algorithm so i

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
was able to answer

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
this and other questions first in my

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
sketching

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,680
before jumping into coding storyboarding

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,639
or sketching is not an easy habit to

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,720
establish

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
because it can feel like you're wasting

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,639
time

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
particularly when liking homework the

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,279
time

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,480
is ticking and you need to submit in a

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
few hours

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,360
but it is an efficient way to approach

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,320
solving a problem or building anything

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,600
this approach exists in many fields and

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
industries

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,279
in the entertainment industry there is

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,839
storyboarding before animating

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
in app or website development there is

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
storyboarding

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,600
of the usa of the user experience in

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,200
architecture and construction

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:19,120
there are blueprints before building etc

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
it is ubiquitous because it works

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:27,200
okay next is making mistakes is normal

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,120
debugging is not a sign of failure

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,120
okay so now we have our solution sketch

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,639
with perhaps some pseudo code here and

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,639
there we can jump into coding

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,480
you write the code and the first thing

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,399
that happens is that

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,600
it doesn't work of course when solving

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,160
these problems

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
and in these homeworks most of the hours

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
were spent

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,000
looking for the part that wasn't working

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
there were

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,760
these were some of the sentences that i

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,760
heard

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
this is not the right output the code is

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
not doing anything

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,639
i can't find what's wrong no matter what

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
i do

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,279
it still doesn't work frustration

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,600
and rage are totally normal emotions

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,959
especially when you have stared at the

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
code for a while

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,720
and already made all the changes you can

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
think of

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
so here is how we systematically

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,959
approach it

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
is python giving you a clue about what

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,440
the problem is

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
sometimes it explicitly tells you what

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,959
is wrong

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,560
or it may point at the line where things

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
went wrong

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
if this is not the case then look for

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,920
small common errors

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,120
like using an equal when you mean to use

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
double equal also are you calling the

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,519
functions but

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,800
by the right name next

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,839
still no clue use print statements

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,680
sometimes this is really helpful like it

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,720
can help you narrow to the section where

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,279
the bug is

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,199
but other times it backfire for example

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,880
when my son put a print statement in a

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,519
recursive function

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,839
he got inundated with output and it was

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,480
really hard to make sense of it

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,800
if this happens minimize and simplify

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,279
fit your functions with the most minimal

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,519
input possible to reveal the bug

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,320
if it's a long function break it into

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,360
two

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,399
and test them separately continue to

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
break the codes

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,560
like lego pieces into smaller and

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,680
smaller components

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,639
that you can test separately

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,199
and if all else fails can you get a

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,360
second

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,720
or third set of eyes to look at your

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
code

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,480
this actually happened during the last

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
homework

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,399
when students were solving the queen's

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,040
problem this is a problem

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,920
where you need to put queens in a

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,160
chessboard

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,839
in such a way that they can't attack

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,160
each other

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,440
so sketching of the solution was done

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,480
writing the functions

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,199
following that solution was done and

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,600
everything seemed fine but really it

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,720
wasn't working in all cases

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,839
it worked for four or five queens

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,399
but it didn't work for seeing six queens

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,120
all the time my son was very frustrated

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,880
this was very weird and he thought he

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,480
had tried everything

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,120
it was time for the extra set of eyes

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
one of his classmates offered to help he

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
took

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,880
one look at my son's code and

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,600
immediately knew what was wrong

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
in the step when you are looking for a

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,440
new

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,279
move a new position to put the queen and

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,399
it proves invisible

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,320
you need to replace your board with its

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,600
previous configuration

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,880
the board was saved as an array and

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,680
my son had used the equal sign

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,199
um to restore the previous configuration

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,559
but this is an assignment

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:08,160
what he really needed was to make a copy

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:12,640
of the array with numpy copy once

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,959
that was fixed it ran beautifully

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,679
okay the next is

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,720
make sure your code does what it's

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,240
supposed to do

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,559
and that it's readable all right

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,079
so now we have code that works do we

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,200
submit

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,799
not yet two things to consider does your

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,679
code really does

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,000
what it's supposed to do and can

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,160
somebody else read it

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,080
i mentioned that the first homework

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,880
didn't go very well

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,039
in that homework students were asked to

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,240
write a variety of functions

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,799
and to grade 300 students automatic

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,000
tests

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,280
graded the scripts students students

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
could see the test

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,440
because they were part of the homework

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,679
my son had written the functions

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
and those functions had passed all the

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,240
tests

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:09,120
but of course when grading happened

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
there were additional hidden tests and

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,799
these

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,520
were the tests where the functions fail

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,640
this was an

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,440
excellent lesson and another case where

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,919
why sketching is very helpful those

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,240
tests

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,440
cover the least obvious cases edge cases

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,400
rare cases when you are designing your

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,520
solution

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,640
you need to think of all of those

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,600
the first time code worked we practice

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,400
trying to break it throw at it the

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,400
weirdest scenarios you can think of

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,160
something as simple as what happens when

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,960
you feed your function a negative number

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,280
and then you can truly be sure that it's

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,039
doing what it's supposed to be doing

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,120
all right so finally your code works

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,520
and is doing what it's supposed to do

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,320
can somebody else read it

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,039
would you be able to come back to it in

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,720
a week

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,520
or in a year and understand it

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
i learned this lesson the hard way as a

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
beginner

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,240
i had done data analysis and

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
that included lots of models and

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,559
simulations

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,039
and then one year later i was asked for

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,760
more simulations and more analysis

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,280
so of course by then i had forgotten all

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,480
about the project

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,600
i opened my code only to find that

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,799
despite having written some comments it

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,840
was not enough

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,039
for me to figure out what past me had

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,760
done

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,320
it was painful and and incredibly

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,960
inefficient

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,000
my son sometimes would feel that if code

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,039
works

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,480
i must submit a zap and move on to the

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,960
next thing

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,559
i understood that it could feel

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,600
counterintuitive

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,600
uh to spend this extra time making

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,720
sure the code is easy to read and

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,000
understand

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,240
but it is an investment and ultimately

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
our requirement to be a successful

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
programmer down the line

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
when you need to work in teams and share

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,159
your code

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,240
and update each other's codes so

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,440
whenever time was available

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,559
i encouraged him to do the following

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,600
first change your variable names

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,200
because names like dummy

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,320
recursion other variable and previous

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,600
are not good names second

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,159
add duct strings to all your functions

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,640
add comments and make sure that they are

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,159
complete sentences

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,480
next can we tidy up some things

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,520
that conditional statement that is four

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,440
lines long

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,039
is there a way to rewrite it in a

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,679
simpler way

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,600
even if it means adding a few more lines

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,000
it is worth it

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,240
and finally can something be written

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,520
more efficiently

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,760
are those three nested for loops really

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,559
necessary

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,640
this part can be time consuming because

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,360
it requires going back to the drawing

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,360
board

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,200
and figuring out a different way to

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,240
reach the solution

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
but if time is available it's worth

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,559
doing

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,559
okay so finally

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,480
don't learn alone find a mentor and find

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,120
a community

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,760
as a wrap-up i think the final lesson

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,880
was to not learn in isolation

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,720
it is much more fun and productive to

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,520
learn alongside others

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,919
if you are learning find a mentor or

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,880
find a community or both

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,000
python has a very large community online

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
and in general

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,440
it is easy to find people to interact

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,919
with

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
when you're taking classes finding a

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,280
community

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
is a bit easier because you are already

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,760
surrounded by

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,320
other people that are also learning

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,159
and there are plenty of classes online

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,159
if you are not part of a class

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,200
and are learning python later in life

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,000
and by yourself

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,679
like i did there are plenty of ways to

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
meet others who are passionate about

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,760
python

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,880
like this conference and also

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,360
local meetups finally

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
you can create your own community and it

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,720
doesn't need to be big to be extremely

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,640
beneficial

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,760
currently i have these two friends and

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
colleagues kelly

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,000
and ryan who are my go-to people for all

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,559
things python

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,559
we interact frequently and help each

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,720
other when we are frustrated or are

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,880
encountering a weird problem

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,320
we share new things that we've learned

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,559
and a few times

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,120
they have been the second set of eyes

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,440
that i really needed for my code

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,880
a few times we have been lucky to work

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,840
on projects together

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,400
in which we pass the code around one

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,120
starts it and the other one finishes it

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,320
it is fantastic and it makes the work

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,520
really enjoyable

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,760
so to wrap up i'm very happy to report

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,799
that over the course over the course of

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,600
his class

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
my son grew closer to his classmates via

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,120
discord

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,760
students became more open in their

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,039
struggles and generous in their health

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,600
i am in all other resilient resilience

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,679
despite the distance students have

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,240
managed to connect with each other

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,159
it is not perfect and doesn't replace

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,799
the in-person interactions

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,400
but i have witnessed their eagerness and

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,679
their genuine effort to create community

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,919
my child succeeded in his class he got

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,840
an

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,080
a and his confidence grew and now feels

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,679
ready to take on more advanced courses

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,559
on his own

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,880
my favorite part is that we grew closer

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,960
because of this experience

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,799
so if you are an experienced programmer

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
i hope you feel inspired to become a

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,360
mentor to support others

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,400
and share your own experience

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
particularly

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,200
with those that are starting their

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,840
programming journey in python

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
thank you

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,279
