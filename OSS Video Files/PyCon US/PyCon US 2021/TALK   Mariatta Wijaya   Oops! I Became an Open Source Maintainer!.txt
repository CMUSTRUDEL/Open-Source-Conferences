Description: 
	I consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open source contribution was in 2016. Since then, I’ve continued to actively contribute to open source and specifically to core Python and Python libraries. Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other people’s open source projects. It’s been quite a journey. Being a new open source contributor has its own challenges, and being a new open source maintainer brings another set of unique challenges. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things I’ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.
