Title: TALK   Mariatta Wijaya   Oops! I Became an Open Source Maintainer!
Publication date: 2021-05-29
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	I consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open source contribution was in 2016. Since then, I’ve continued to actively contribute to open source and specifically to core Python and Python libraries. Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other people’s open source projects. It’s been quite a journey. Being a new open source contributor has its own challenges, and being a new open source maintainer brings another set of unique challenges. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things I’ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
my name is mariata and i'm joining you

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,680

thank you so much for joining and

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
watching my talk today

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,119
most of you probably know that i am a

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,119
python core developer

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
if you're not sure what it means i do

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
have a talk titled what is a python core

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
developer which i gave it

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,960
at pyconus a couple years ago so please

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,879
look that up on youtube

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,480
the short summary is that if you have a

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,120
pull request to python programming

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,840
language

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
i can merge it for you basically i'm one

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,920
of the maintainers of one of the most

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
popular programming language

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,680
and for my contributions to python i've

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
received recognitions

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
such as the python software foundation

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,160
community service award

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
i'm also a psl member i've been

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,199
nominated twice

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
for the google open source peer bonus

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,600
program and i've been featured on github

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,479
as one of the maintainers

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
for github sponsors program the readme

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,960
project

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,720
and recently when github announced the

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
new mars helicopter badge

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,080
somehow they decided to use my github

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,960
profile to be featured

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,119
thing is i'm new at this i've really

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
only started contributing to open source

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,400
quite recently

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
my first ever contribution to open

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,520
source was 2016

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,400
and that was five years ago so i i

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,000
wasn't born doing this i haven't been

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,759
a long time maintainers of open source

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,399
but since then i've continued to

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,360
actively contribute to lots of projects

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,399
and somehow i ended up with being given

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
commit rights

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,040
to other people's open source projects

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
and all of a sudden i felt like i have a

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
set of new responsibilities and i wasn't

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,280
fully

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,759
prepared for it all so in this talk

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
i want to share my journey how i got

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
here

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,360
i want to share what it's like as a

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,039
brand new open source maintainer

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,479
i want to share some of the mistakes

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,520
that i've made

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,560
and originally why i've

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
continued in this path what i hope by

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,239
sharing my story

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
whether you're an aspiring contributor

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,400
or an experienced maintainer

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,200
i hope you can do it much better than me

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,200
so how did how did this happen people

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,040
are asking like how to get started

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
contributing do i have any

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,879
tips or secrets to share on how this

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080
works

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,040
and i'm i'm glad to hear your enthusiasm

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
into getting to open source but really

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,560
for me like how

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
how did it happen i i don't know it's it

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
happened suddenly

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
one day i was just making my first ever

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
pull request

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
to open source and by the end of the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,080
year i

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,599
got commit rights to couple projects and

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
shortly after that i

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,319
i got the commit to see python

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
i don't know how it happened it happens

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,040
suddenly

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,959
um and since then i've kept it up

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
and now i'm a member of various open

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,440
source projects

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,640
but i think the real question is not how

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,239
did it happen but

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,959
why what motivated me into starting

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,720
to contribute to open source what drove

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,599
me into this

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,239
i've been a long time user to python so

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360
why did

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,760
all of a sudden i became inspired to

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
start contributing and to give back to

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,680
the community

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,120
this story began in 2015 when i attended

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,640
bikon in montreal

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,920
it was my first ever pycon and i went to

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,319
attend guido van rossum's keynote

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,080
so in his keynote he talked about how in

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,120
the python core team

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,519
there was no women at all at that time

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
he had just attended python language

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,680
summit

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:06,400
it was a room of 50 men no women at all

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
and then he he offered he realized this

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
is a problem and he

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,879
he was offering to help mentor women

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,720
into contributing to python

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,840
when i heard this fact i was shocked

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,360
like it didn't make sense it felt

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,880
wrong like how how did it happen

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,120
um but back then i

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
didn't really do anything about it at

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,840
that time i was

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,160
feeling curious like how did this happen

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
but at the same time i didn't think it

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,360
was my problem

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,400
it was python's problem not mine i

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
felt like i'm just a user i didn't think

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,759
like

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,560
there was anything i could do about it

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,440
so a year later i went back to pycon and

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
i was hoping to hear like who are the

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
new python core developers

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
the new women python core developers but

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
instead

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
guido admitted that there was still no

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,680
women in the team

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,280
and he renewed his offer that he's

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,680
willing to mentor even more women

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,639
and at that time that's when it really

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,240
hit me that

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,440
there is this problem

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
there is a barrier that i i didn't

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,759
realize

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,520
there is a certain barrier in the python

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,759
open source community

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,479
that somehow for 20 some years

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
all of the core developers have all been

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,440
men

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
so there's there's a diversity problem

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,680
and if i thought that it's not my

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
problem before this time i realized for

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
myself that

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,160
this is a problem i care a lot about

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,479
and i wanted to do something about it

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
i didn't know what to even do about it i

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,199
mean i could i could complain

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
i could just say hey you you python you

00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,759
have

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
diversity problem and you gotta fix it

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
somehow

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,400
but i i think pointing fingers was not

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,039
productive

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,800
so i thought maybe i'll give this a try

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,400
let's let's see what it's all about

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,600
maybe i can contribute to open source

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,639
so i wrote email to guido federation

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
and as for mentorship i felt really

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,240
lucky that he actually replied

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,120
so i asked for advice

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,960
these are some of the early advice to me

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,240
that he gave

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,560
first he suggested that focus on modules

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
that i found interesting

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
go check out the repository check out

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,840
the contributing guide

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,560
and if i have trouble following the

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
guide if the documentation was not clear

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,319
then

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,600
go help with the documentation he also

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
suggested

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,199
go check out the bug tracker and look at

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
issues

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
so the thing is initially i didn't

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
really

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,520
find the c python project too

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,919
interesting i followed the advice i

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
subscribed to the backtracker but

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,560
nothing made sense to me

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,360
i just didn't feel like i have

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,479
i have anything to contribute to i

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
didn't feel like

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,080
i could help with anything at all so i

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,800
started thinking

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,599
maybe if i couldn't contribute to python

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
that's okay

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
maybe i should start contribute to some

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,520
other projects

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,400
so that's when i started looking into

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,520
other projects like the

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,840
python.org project i thought

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,000
it would be better if it's a project

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,960
where i have some familiarity

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,120
where instead of trying to learn an

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,440
entirely new code base i could just

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,000
make use of existing skills and

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,199
knowledge that i already have

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,599
so the python.org project

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
is is an open source and it's built with

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,560
django

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
something i at that time i was already

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,319
familiar with i was already

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,759
experienced using django library

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,280
so when i checked out the python.org

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,240
code base

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,199
unlike the c python code because i felt

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
more at home

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
like i felt like yes this whole thing

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,879
makes sense

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,120
so instead of instead of

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,450
feeling intimidated i feel like i can

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,800
contribute here

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,919
[Music]

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,080
and whether i'm contributing to see

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,200
python or to any other projects the

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,839
first steps here is still the same

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,240
go check out the repository read the

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,800
contributing guide

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,800
and if there's no contributing guide or

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,320
is of or if it's not complete sometimes

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,600
this happens

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,360
i would go ahead and help and help

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,519
improve the documentation where it lacks

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
so now that i found a project that i

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
could contribute to

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,800
in my mind i was thinking about let's

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,200
let's find an issue

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,040
let's find an issue and write pull

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
requests

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
um the thing is over time i've learned

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
that

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,560
it's not about finding an issue but i

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,519
have to wait

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,839
i have to wait like i would i would have

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,959
to watch the repository

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,680
sometimes the thing or the thing i could

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,200
help with

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,760
hasn't been reported so

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
that's when i i would start watching the

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
repositories and subscribe to any

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
updates

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,680
that happen to it and instead of

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,720
fixating on only creating pull requests

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,240
i ended up starting to just review the

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
existing open issues

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,040
reviewing all the existing pull requests

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
um even if it's not something i was

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000
already familiar

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
with i would start joining the

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,839
discussion

00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:01,600
ask questions sometimes i would just

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,079
help verify whether whether the bug is

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
still

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,200
a bug or not um

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
sometimes it's been fixed but the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
maintainers just forgot to close it it

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
happens

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
so i would go in and just tell the

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
maintainers hey this

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,760
is this is this is done just you just

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,760
need to close it

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,200
um this is how i was given

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,640
the commit right to the koala project

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,079
and to the python.org website it's

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
it's not because i made hundreds of pull

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
requests

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,560
but because i i help with all other

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,440
things as well i help with triaging

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
and i think the other maintainers notice

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
my

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
activities that way and i think they

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
just saw that

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
i cared about this project and they

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
decided that they could

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,680
trust me and give me the commit

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
privileges

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,640
um

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
as i've gotten more active in the open

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
source i

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,560
realized that becoming a contributor to

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,680
the project is very much

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,880
like starting a new job at a tech

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,200
company

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
when you start a new job the first few

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
days maybe even

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,000
first few weeks you'll be in onboarding

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,399
and training sessions

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,399
maybe there's someone more senior

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,160
assigned to mentor you give your

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,600
walkthrough of the code base and

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,839
everything

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
maybe you get assigned a small task

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,880
and then as you get more familiarized

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
with the code base

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,120
you can start implementing big features

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,519
on your own without help

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
being a new contributor to any open

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,160
source project

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,880
is no different it will take time

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,440
for you to understand the code base and

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,800
the workflow before you can start making

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,440
a substantial feature or bug fix

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
the biggest difference is that there is

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,279
no one

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,120
assigned to mentor you or to walk you

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,839
through the code base

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
there is no one who will assign you a

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,839
ticket

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:17,120
you have to find a ticket for yourself

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,240
you have it's up to you we maintainers

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,160
don't know

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
what are the things you want to do

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,240
you have to be asking questions you have

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
to

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,680
go you need to give yourself a walk

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,360
through

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,320
of the code base and instead of

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,720
spending full time working training to

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,760
get familiarized with the project

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,480
you do this in whatever free time

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,680
you have available so it will take time

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,079
to learn the code base

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,639
it will not be a day or two it might not

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,720
even be a week

00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,000
c python code base is like 30 years old

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,880
is older than the legacy code base that

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,240
you have in your company

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,959
and contributing to contributing to open

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
source is

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,040
more than simply find an issue

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,800
and make code changes it's also about

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,959
becoming a part of the team

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,399
you gotta join the discussion forum you

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,519
gotta participate

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,519
in all the discussions and all that i

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,240
think you shouldn't focus

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,440
only on the open issues and only on

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,000
writing codes

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,279
and and then ignore the rest of the

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,480
community you can

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,600
you can't ignore the community

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,560
so what happens the first time i became

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
a maintainer all of a sudden i found

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,120
myself receiving

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,920
lots lots of emails because

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
i got automatically added to all the

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,720
repos

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,040
um even now i'm still trying

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
to figure out how to better manage my

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,760
emails

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,519
it's getting better but every few days i

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,160
still found myself

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,680
going to my inbox and look at the number

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,240
of android emails and i'd

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,880
close my eyes and just mark mark

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,959
everything as

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,600
read so i'm sorry if i missed your email

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,079
if you are expecting an important reply

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,030
to me

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,399
please send your email again

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,199
[Music]

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,920
and as as a contributor often my

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,959
involvement

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,760
ends after i create that pr what happens

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,800
after

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,279
i didn't have to be to invest too much

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,760
it's whenever the maintainer have time

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,920
whenever the maintainer decided

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
that they want to accept or reject my

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,240
peer

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,120
now as a maintainer i have to make that

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,000
decision

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:51,120
i need to decide whether to merge and

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,839
for projects as large as see python

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
we often have to think not just about

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,880
the pr

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,639
itself but about the long-term

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,240
maintenance burden

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,240
of accepting the pr and how about how

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,040
this change will impact

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,760
the rest of python users just because

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
one person

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,040
wanted it doesn't mean the rest of

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,480
python users

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,959
want it too and in in the in addition to

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,079
those

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,399
maintainers have to deal with things

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
like

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,680
code of conduct issues within their

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,920
project and

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
they gotta moderate their communication

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,639
channels

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,320
which is not easy it's it's hard and i

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,199
don't think

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,079
maintainers have to deal with this i

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,759
think they have enough responsibilities

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
i think coc committee moderators should

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,360
be

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,120
a separate body separate org

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,759
than the maintainers but often this risk

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
responsibility falls by default to the

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,759
maintainers

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
because maintainers are the ones who own

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,040
the

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,279
project they have the power to

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,320
block or reject users

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,720
on top of all of those one of the rules

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,560
as a maintainer is to represent

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
on behalf of the project kind of

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
becoming the spokesperson for the

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,240
project so

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,199
i realized that i'm no longer speaking

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
or acting

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,440
for myself but on behalf of the

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,639
community

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
how i choose to act or to behave out

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,240
there

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,720
becomes a reflection of the community i

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,240
belong to

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,120
and i've made mistakes i've i was making

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,040
some of the big decisions on my own like

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,440
i banned a user

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,720
from a github org kind of big decision

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,279
banning a person is a serious punishment

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,120
like it's basically you're rejecting

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,160
them from your community or

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,680
you're denying their involvement so

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,680
this is in one of the smaller

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,000
communities not python

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,000
but i found someone made an

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,639
inappropriate pull request

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,079
i found it disrespectful i didn't want

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,160
to trouble the rest of my

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,000
community having to deal with this i

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,799
just i went ahead and blocked the

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,079
account without telling anybody

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,319
the thing is it was a kind of

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,520
decision i should not have made on my

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,120
own like i should have

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,400
followed procedures follow procedure of

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,799
the code of conduct

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,720
let the committee know or at least tell

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,280
the other maintainers

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,840
about this so we can act as a group

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,000
instead of just

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,039
myself but the biggest mistake i made

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
was not

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,440
i was not managing my time wisely um

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,440
people was asking how do i manage my my

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,480
time in my life

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,039
i i don't know i don't have i do not

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
have

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,000
work life volunteer balance my life is

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,240
not well balanced i i didn't have

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
my priorities in the right order there

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,679
was time when

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,919
instead of being with my family on

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,559
holidays instead of being in my

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,039
children's school performance i was

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,120
elsewhere in another county attending

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,520
python conference

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,240
i wasn't setting boundaries and rules

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,640
for myself and i was giving way too much

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,200
time

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,360
and energy to open source and then i

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,200
burn out and i went through

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,760
mental health issues but despite all

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
that

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
despite of the troubles i've endured i'm

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
still here

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,000
i'm still actively contributing to open

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,039
source and i've continued saying yes

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,160
to help people with their projects

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,360
why am i doing this believe it or not if

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,520
i contribute

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,919
too actively to a project to the point

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,840
of being given commit rights is because

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,480
i really do care a lot about it

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,760
working openly in open source is a

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
unique experience

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,679
it's very different environment than

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,720
working in a company

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,679
i get exposed to unique challenges

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
not normally face at work and it's fun i

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
get to learn about

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
new libraries new things that people are

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
building and i get

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,559
to play with those and use those way

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,480
faster than

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,720
at work and i've gained a lot

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
from the community not only that i'm

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,679
continuously learning

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,559
but i got things like awards and

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,080
recognitions and those are fun those are

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,440
valuable to me

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
and i i felt the sense of responsibility

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,520
to

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,240
pay it forward and to give it back

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,880
i've i attended peter wang's keynote at

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
pycon

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,440
germany the other the other year and he

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,559
was talking about open source community

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
and said that

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,760
in open source the more you give the

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,160
more you get back

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
and i just find it resonates with me a

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,559
lot

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,520
another reason why i'm continuing is

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
that

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
almost immediately when i first started

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,240
i found

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,200
acceptance from the community

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,760
when i emailed guido and asked for help

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,320
i

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,919
didn't need to prove anything to him i

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,559
didn't have to go to like

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,919
on-site interviews and answer tons of

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,840
questions

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,280
in order to become a python core

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,600
developer

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,000
somehow the community has accepted me

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,000
and for once in a long time

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,720
i feel like i belong and that sense of

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,799
belonging

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,120
is important to me so that's my story

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,720
now that you've learned about my journey

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,200
i do have a few more

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,320
words of advice for all of you aspiring

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,559
open source contributors and maintainers

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,799
first of all when your extended

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,840
invitation to collaborate and maintain a

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,360
project

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,159
ask what is their expectation of you

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
establish boundaries if there's any ask

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,679
if there's anything

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,480
you needed to do differently now that

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,159
you got

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,159
the commit privilege i found out many

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,280
open source projects that i've joined

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,200
they have really great

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,640
contributing guide which is a

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,679
documentation

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
aimed to help new contributors into

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,559
contributing

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
but very few that i've seen that

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,760
actually have maintaining skype like

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,559
there there's no need new maintainer on

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,400
boarding guide

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,720
so perhaps the thinking is that if

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,880
someone has contributed long enough

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
maybe they they know everything about it

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
already

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,240
but maintaining a project is not the

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,360
same as contributing

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,120
there are additional responsibilities

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,919
and powers so if your project doesn't

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,039
yet have

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,919
a maintenance guide start one and

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,400
just you can start documenting as as you

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,600
learn

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,480
as you get on board

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,520
projects should have succession plan in

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
place

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,960
maybe there's an unwritten expectation

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
that

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
maintainers will be around for a long

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
time

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
i've only been around in open source for

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
a few years

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,120
and in this short time i have seen

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,840
various maintainers come and go

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,159
sometimes not even about maintainers who

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,000
go

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,320
completely retired but people need

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,159
people need time off from time to time

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,480
maybe they're starting a family

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,919
starting a new job they have family

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,159
emergency

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,159
or they just they get burned out so they

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,600
need to take half a year off from

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
everything it happens it could happen

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,360
suddenly

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,159
anytime there shouldn't be an aspect of

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,240
the project

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,320
that is owned by only one person

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,400
and i know that open source projects

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,039
they come to conferences they host

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,559
sprints and help new contributors

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,559
contribute to the project

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,039
i think it's great i would also

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,440
recommend doing an annual sprint

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,520
for the maintainers for the and for the

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,840
experienced contributors

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,159
for example in python we have an annual

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,640
core developer sprint where we have we

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,200
would have

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
one week to focus on implementation and

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,840
discussions

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,640
and less about mentoring someone new

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,240
it's it's been very valuable to us we do

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
it once a year for the past several

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,360
years now

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,679
i think you should try it for your

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,799
project just maybe take few days off

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,280
from work and hack on your project

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,880
and most of the maintainers that i know

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
they do this for free

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,880
still having funding for your project

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,840
would be great

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,679
maybe you need money for infrastructure

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
for your project like

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,880
maybe you need private github repo web

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,840
hosting maybe you need a better laptop

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,919
you need to host a sprint or you want to

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
take a week off so you can focus on your

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,919
project

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,640
money makes all of those things happen

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
and

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,159
money is a great reward for your

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,880
contributions to open source

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,440
your work provides value to people so

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,760
there are

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
lots of programs out there to help fund

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,679
your open source project

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,880
look into github sponsors program

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,159
tightlift or patreon

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,760
and above all take care of yourself your

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,480
project is important

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,039
but no more important than your own

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,000
health

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,360
and well-being remember what your

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,799
priorities are

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,520
take time off when you need it and

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,000
don't feel guilty about it if you have

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,320
written

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,279
maintenance guide you have succession

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
plan in place

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,320
i'm sure you'll feel at ease leaving

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,440
your project to your co-maintainers

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,279
