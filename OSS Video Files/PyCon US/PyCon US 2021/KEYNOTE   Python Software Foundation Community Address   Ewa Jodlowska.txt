my name is eva jolowska

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,080
and i am the executive director of the

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,080
python software foundation

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
the organization that's behind this

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,480
event and more generally the non-profit

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,840
behind the python programming language

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,000
and his community 2021

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,160
is such a unique year for many reasons

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,960
but most importantly to pycon

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,679
it's python's 30th anniversary and the

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,559
psf's 20th anniversary

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,320
no one can contest that those years were

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,120
years of growth

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,120
in the last 20 years the psf supported

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
thousands of efforts and initiatives

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,840
that all

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,680
helped pave the road to where we are

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,520
today

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,000
the last 15 months have been different

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
they've been challenging and for many

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,640
they continue to be challenging

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
and just like for all non-profits the

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,359
psf

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,280
was impacted financially those 15 months

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
thanks to the generosity of our

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
community and

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,159
corporate sponsors we weathered through

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,560
and continued to support the python

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,720
community in any way that we could

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
we relaunched our grants program to

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,159
support virtual initiatives in education

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,479
we renovated our sponsorship program to

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,360
draw more funding towards packaging

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,439
and see python we learned about virtual

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,960
events so our community could gather

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
at python us today but we need to think

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,200
beyond today

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,840
the next 20 years are at our doorstep

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
and what we do today impacts how things

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
will play out

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,000
i've been with the psf in various roles

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,320
for over 10 years now

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,920
the growth of python's community and

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,479
python's popularity

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
means that more support is needed now

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
more than ever

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,320
we're against a long to do list without

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,119
the support structure in place

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
to tackle that to do list and when i say

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,840
support structure i mean

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,960
several things like prioritization with

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,759
community needs in mind management

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,000
resources and all other things required

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,560
for all of this to succeed

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
thankfully the psf is financially

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,879
healthy all things considered

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
and we were able to take on large

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,440
initiatives this year to start

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,520
addressing some of those structural gaps

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
i'm super excited to be able to tell you

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
about them today

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,520
first in march of this year the psf

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,560
hired morgan mayo our first

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,280
ever director of resource development

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,480
morgan's role is to spearhead financial

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,760
sustainability

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,239
for the psf's programs second

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
we announced a call for resumes for

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
python's first

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
ever developer in residence this role

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
will

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,519
help our volunteers by addressing

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
backlog and help us prioritize work

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
going forward

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920
third we announced another call for

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,720
resumes but this time for packaging

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,040
and it's for a project manager this role

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,200
will be surveying packaging stakeholders

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,560
and users to prioritize work going

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
forward and will also

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,440
manage implementation of several

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,599
functionalities to help organizations

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,319
streamline their workflows on pipi

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,599
now comes the urgency of sustaining

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,440
those initiatives

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,879
and continuing to strengthen our support

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,360
in these areas when work

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,239
is prioritized within packaging and see

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
python

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
we will need more resources to address

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,280
those tasks

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
some of the work will be done through

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,400
collaborations

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,200
with third-party contractors and of

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,239
course the majority of the work is done

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
with the support and leadership of our

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,879
volunteers

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
but to have a healthy structure in place

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,720
for

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,239
volunteers and contractors to succeed

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,200
we still need more staff so you may be

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,239
thinking how does the psf get money

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,400
the largest source of revenue for us is

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,480
this event pycon us

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
if you bought a ticket to attend or if

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,159
you're sponsoring this event

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
you are helping us fulfill our mission

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
to support python additionally the psf

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
holds

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
several fundraisers throughout the year

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,800
actually we have one happening now but

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,680
i'll tell you about that towards the end

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
but we also have a corporate sponsorship

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,080
program

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
as well as looking for opportunities to

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
apply for private grants

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
and eventually down the line government

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
grants

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,479
all of these financial resources

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,759
combined help us

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,800
operate today i want to draw specific

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,960
attention

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,720
to corporate sponsorships companies like

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,160
google bloomberg and microsoft

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,040
really led by example this year together

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
these organizations gave the psf more

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,759
than

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,280
a million dollar more than half a

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
million i apologize more than half a

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,880
million to kick

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,199
off these new initiatives this year but

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,440
now we have to start the discussions on

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
continuing that funding because we don't

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
want these roles to disappear after a

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
couple of years

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,560
does your organization use python does

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,280
your organization use pypi

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
let's talk does your organization have

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,440
an open source office

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,400
we'd love to meet them we understand

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,600
that having those discussions internally

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,800
can be challenging and no two companies

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,520
have the same processes our staff

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,479
can help by helping provide material or

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,479
any data points

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,479
that said let's take a closer look at

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
where the psf

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,039
is today with its finances and take a

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,919
look at the details

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,000
of our finances through q1 of this year

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,800
as a nonprofit supported by its

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
community

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
it's important for the psf to openly

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,639
discuss its finances

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,919
it not only keeps members of our

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
community informed

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,600
but also holds us accountable for our

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,520
work

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,199
the columns on the left represent

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,680
financial numbers through march

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
2020 and the columns on the right

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,319
represent financial numbers

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
through march of 2021. taking a closer

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
look at revenue

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
we are almost on par with what we had

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,479
generated this time last year

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
which is really exceptional looking at

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,120
expenses

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
there is a large difference mainly

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,800
because it is

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
way more cost efficient to run python us

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,520
virtually

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,360
in 2020 net income was negative around

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,720
this time of year because we were in the

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,000
process of canceling

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,759
python in person i am happy to report

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,840
that through q1 of 2021 net income

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
is positive

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,919
here we see the psf's total assets

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
compared

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,319
between two years keep in mind we are

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
comparing through march of 2020

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,599
and through march of 2021. even though

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
this past year our total assets

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,360
decreased a bit due to

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,639
the packaging grants that we've been

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
paying out

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,280
as well as paying for operations we are

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,759
financially stable

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
as some of you may know the psf has

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,599
built up

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,199
a financial reserve of one and a half

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,919
years of its operating

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,880
expenses to support ongoing funding

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,800
needs

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,400
especially during times of economic

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,880
uncertainties

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,919
and as we saw in march of last year that

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,280
financial reserve

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,080
is an absolute must overall we are

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
in decent financial shape and i have

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,080
included a link to our annual impact

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
report if you would like to learn more

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
about our programs and finances

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,960
as i mentioned earlier it is super

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,440
important for the psf to maintain

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,440
financial stability as it takes on three

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,759
new major roles this year

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,759
with that in mind our team put together

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,280
a unique fundraiser for pycon to

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,680
highlight our anniversaries

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,599
and also provide community with some

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,919
really cool swag

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
for the first time we are sending out

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,080
donation gifts to anyone that

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,759
contributes to our fundraiser this month

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,479
if you give 99 or more or become

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,039

on the timeline and what

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
responsibilities board directors have

check them out we also hosted

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
three member meetings during python and

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,839
all three were recorded

as well

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,320
so before we wrap up let's celebrate

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,160
some volunteers

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,399
typically in an in-person event i would

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
have these awesome volunteers on stage

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,040
with me but unfortunately that's not

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,880
possible this year

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,839
so i'd still like to give them

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,320
recognition during my presentation

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,920
they continue to go above and beyond in

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
their commitment to the python

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,399
to the python community so i really want

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,240
to say a huge thank you to abigail

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,800

why doesn't it roll it's rolling okay

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:08,420
[Music]

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,519
this is uh this is the artwork that i

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,560
planned on donating to the last

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,000
pycon it's meant to go with uh the vinyl

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,279
that supposedly is getting

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,040
pressed that uh very worse on a few of

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,519
us

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,640
contribute songs to the psf has really

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,320
helped support pie ladies how's that

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,979
there it is

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,979
[Music]

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,959
oh yeah the the record of python or

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,440
python related songs

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,240
for the pi ladies auction i remember

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
receiving an

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
email about the super secret hush hush

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,920
project to do this

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,160
and if i would contribute anything

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,000
of my own somewhere in the song there is

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,360
there is there's loud bell

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,920
and that was me um uh i think on the

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
bowl of a big mixing bowl i got in my

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,639
kitchen

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,800
i think it was something like this

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,959
a language named after monty python i

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,720
mean you know humor is just baked into

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,720
the dna of python

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,360
every language gets the community that

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,000
it deserves and and

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,160
python must be a very special language

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,800
because it has an

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,800
amazing community

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
when i learned to program i didn't just

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
learn python

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
i gained an entire community when i

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,760
first joined

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,600
the python community there were a lot of

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
folks who

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,959
you know was afraid they would make fun

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,200
of me because i didn't really know much

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,639
python at the time but folks were very

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,120
welcoming and open to

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
teaching me and and and guiding me and i

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
hope that

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
uh today i can kind of be in the same

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,279
role for others

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,399
if i did not join psf

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,680
and pie ladies i will not be able to

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,200
know that this community actually helped

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,240
people so much it's

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,279
it's really

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
okay to ask questions in among this

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,639
community

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,680
this is actually my goal to get my team

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
members

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,880
to join by this year i

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,680
i recently joined the uh

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,160
the board of directors for the psf and

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,639
i've been

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,320
just really touched by how supportive

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,199
folks are

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
with each other i i will say that it's

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,040
um

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
it's a really wonderful group of people

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
and

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,399
you know lives are messy and and when

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,199
things happen to the members

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,880
folks kind of really step in and and

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,639
they're supportive and i've been really

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
touched by that

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,639
i have several disabilities and with the

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,680
pandemic

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,160
i've had like two years from hell and

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
major medical problems i've had six

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
surgeries

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,959
all of this stuff and the python

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,000
community has like

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
just come together to support me and

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,079
mentor me through it

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,480
it's really felt like i would not have

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,040
this experience in any other environment

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,160
like i've had people who oh i know this

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,399
other person who runs this other project

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,760
so they'll get in touch with me and just

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,480
volunteer their time

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,680
to say okay you can't handle everything

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,519
right now because you're in the hospital

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,680
here's what i can do here

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,959
and just the willingness to sorry

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,120
just because like there was a point

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,240
where i thought oh my god i'm gonna have

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,399
to just tell them

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,760
i can't do this and people just came

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,800
around me and like

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,320
did it because they care

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,760
about the community and and yeah so

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,480
anyway sorry like right now just

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,279
warms my heart and it's it inspires me

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,320
it for me the community is why i am

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,639
still

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,079
working on python to this day

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,519
so i have a lot of enjoyment with using

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,360
the language

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,480
and and it's given me just a new path

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,880
i think in my life and a new passion

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,839
i would say on a personal level my

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,279
relationship

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,519
with the python software foundation i

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,920
think it started when we um

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,680
started the discussions to have uh one

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,759
bike on in spain so i was part of the

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,440
organizing committee of pike in spain

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,360
and without the python software

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,399
foundation it would have been impossible

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
right because

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,440
the psf can give us grants and a lot of

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,720
help and resources to make sure that

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,199
we have a good um conference and that's

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
when we

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,120
started to discuss things with them but

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,240
also on my work as a core developer

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
we are in constant contact for instance

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
for

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
managing infrastructure and all the

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
things that we need to keep the language

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,240
running such as ci

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
uh test servers uh and and the like so

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
so

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
and without that it would be impossible

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,560
to have the language that we use today

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,399
well the psf is absolutely critical to

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
the success of python

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
i see the two the steering council and

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,040
the

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,839
psf as partners in growing what

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
what this a magical thing that we have

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,519
because

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
the psf is really excellent at growing

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,240
the community and nurturing the

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
community and

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,920
putting on pycon and things like that

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
and really

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
looking at that from a global standpoint

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,839
you know all the regional picons

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,240
all the all the um financial aid that we

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
give

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,160
and the support that we give to such a

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
diverse

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
python community and the steering

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
council

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
is sort of the technical you know

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,560
leaders like we're

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,639
we're uh charged with um

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,000
being the stewards for the language and

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
the technical side of things

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,199
python is grassroots open source and i

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,240
may work for microsoft and other

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,280
core developers may work for google but

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,799
uh with a

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,280
few exceptions even the people who work

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,720
for

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,160
for big names in tech actually do most

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,360
of their work on python

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,480
in their spare time not

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,400
motivated by the financial or technical

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,840
goals of their employer

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,039
but motivated by their own sort of

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,320
interest in this very cool piece of

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,160
technology

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,280
and python is much more than just

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,320
a language it's it's a community

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,160
and sort of

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,919
telling yourself that you're part of

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
this community that you're a member of

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
the community and that you should have a

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,679
say

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,240
in sort of

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,440
where this community is going what how

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,720
this community

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,080
behaves itself

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,840
are are important statements about

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,600
yourself

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,280
and a sort of a community

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,720
like python has to have

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,160
uh a broad membership

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,080
so we we really want everyone who

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,640
who sort of feels they care about python

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,520
who would rather code in python than in

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,000
some other language

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,919
we want you to be able to say that by by

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
joining the psf as a member

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,880
so that's the wonderful thing about this

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,559
community that you don't have to be a

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,120
coder to be welcome

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,039
or to be to be a part of it because all

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,880
skills are needed and necessary to

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,340
advance the mission of python so i think

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,410
that's just so beautiful

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,410

how do you make money if you give it

00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:01,600
away for free

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,600
python hasn't infected me

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,600
gather round children i'll tell you

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,360
about python in the old days you know

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,960
back in my day

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
it's a new day

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,320
i first was introduced to python because

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,559
the person

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,679
i was dating wanted me to see what he

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,679
did all day

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,799
and i actually that person ended up

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,280
becoming my spouse

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,440
this jacket is powered by python and

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,919
bluetooth i can change the colors for my

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,080
phone

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
a few years ago it was my first 3d

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,280
printing project

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,280
today is a psf day

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
you can have your voice be heard you can

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
make a difference

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
especially if you're coming from an

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,039
underrepresented background we

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
as we younger people we are we trying to

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,160
get more bold

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,919
right and we say okay so this has been

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
done for quite a lot of time let's

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,240
change it because

00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:07,450
it's now the time well that's about all

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:09,440
