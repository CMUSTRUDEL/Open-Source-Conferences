Title: TALK   Nina Zakharenko   More Fun With Hardware and CircuitPython - IoT, Wearables, and more!
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	Learn about programming hardware with Python and advanced uses of CircuitPython by walking through exciting demos of real-world projects in action. Advanced components like buttons, sensors, and screens bump up the fun and the interactivity of your project. Level-up your hardware skills in this fast-paced talk!

CircuitPython is the education-friendly fork of MicroPython that's been steadily rising in popularity as new releases increase stability, reliability, and speed. CircuitPython allows Python enthusiasts to quickly learn about hardware projects without having to learn something completely brand new. Given the rise in popularity, the Python community is quickly becoming familiar with the basics of CircuitPython. In fact, all attendees of PyCon US in 2019 were given a CircuitPython-compatible CircuitPlayground Express device with LEDs, speakers, sensors, and more, all usable without the need of learning to solder.

If you're interested in doing more with hardware, this talk will point you in the right direction of where to go next. We'll start with choosing the right device for the scope of your project. Next, we'll scratch the surface of working with electronics -- what's a circuit? What are good resources for learning to solder? Lastly, I'll cover topics such as IoT, wearables, and adding interactivity to your projects with sensors, buttons, and switches with live demos of real-world projects I've created, along with sharing the build process and code for each.

Viewers will finish the talk feeling confident about continuing their hardware journey across a range of project types.

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,199
hi

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,760
i'm nina zakarenko and welcome to more

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,119
fun

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,680
with circuit python iot wearables and

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,640
more

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,279
a little bit about who i am i currently

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,439
work at microsoft as a python developer

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
advocate and my focus is to make azure

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,880
and vs code better to use for python

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,200
developers everywhere

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
i've written software for a long time at

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
companies like meetup reddit

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
and hbo and i've worked on a lot of

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,160
projects

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,520
big and small in a wide variety of

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,200
organizations

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,600
if you'd like to reach out please follow

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,239
me on twitter at nnja

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
and occasionally i also live code on

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,000
twitch

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,160
you can find me at nnjaio

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
and my website and blog is at nnja.i

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
i just wanted to let you know that the

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,239
slides are available to download and the

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
url

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,640
is on almost every slide and if you

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
download these slides as a pdf you can

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,439
click through the links there are lots

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,479
of helpful resources throughout

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,119
so why python on hardware

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,759
you might be wondering well as we know

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,360
python

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,680
is easy to learn it's easy to teach and

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
writing c plus or arduino isn't

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,119
necessarily accessible to everyone in

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,520
quite the same way

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,560
and since python on hardware has become

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
more popular

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,200
i've seen the makerspace become a lot

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
more active more diverse

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,320
there are plenty of educational

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
resources and

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,600
i feel like it's really leveling the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
playing field and allotting

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,880
allowing a lot more people to

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
participate who might not have been able

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
to participate before

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,240
now this talk is going to go a little

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,399
bit beyond the basics

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
two years ago at pike on us i gave a

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,600
keynote on how

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,759
python on hardware is changing the

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,920
hardware landscape for the better

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
so if you want to start with the basics

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
i recommend that you watch

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
that talk well a very favorite activity

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,600
of mine

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,280
is wearable electronics i love using

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,360
creativity to figure out

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,720
how to put leds in clothes and jewelry

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
and more with tiny batteries and

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,040
microcontrollers

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,640
you can add interactivity like sensors

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,840
screens some of them even support touch

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,440
you can create graphics you can

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,879
also connect with bluetooth and

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,360
i'm going to show you a little bit of a

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,040
demo of that later

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
you can add sensors so you can test for

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,280
measurements

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,160
like temperature humidity light sensors

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
microphones

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,080
all sorts of things and also if your

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
device supports

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,840
internet connectivity you can

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
use the whole internet of things

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
landscape so you can use data from apis

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
you can log data from sensor readings

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
over time you can even send remote

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
commands to your device

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,200
you'll really need to consider the needs

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
of your project when you choose a device

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,480
and you choose your components

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,040
um is it for iot well

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,159
then it's going to need wi-fi is it do

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
you need sensors

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,440
are you going to be measuring anything

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,000
are those sensors going to be

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
on board so on the device itself or are

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
you going to have to purchase

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,879
those components separately you might

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
need to consider

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
this size for example for wearables you

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,360
might need smaller components

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,120
smaller batteries flexible materials

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
or if you just want to run straight

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,720
python

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
you might consider a raspberry pi

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
instead of working

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
with a variant like circuit python or

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
micropython

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,799
that's a variant for microcontrollers

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
and lastly

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
you're going to want to think about are

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,840
you comfortable with soldering or not so

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
as you advance in your python journey

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
your python on hardware journey you're

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,120
going to have to learn

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,400
a few other concepts and a few other

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
topics

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
you're going to need to know a little

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,159
bit about electronics

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,159
honestly it really helps to have

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,360
understanding of some of the basic

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,040
concepts you don't need to have a

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,799
four-year degree in this topic

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,519
to be successful at it i would say that

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,919
sparkfun has some really good resources

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
and

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,639
some of the things that you're going to

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
want to learn about are those basic

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
concepts you're going to want to learn

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
about units of measurement i'm going to

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
want to learn

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,440
about basic circuits and

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,040
things like a voltage current

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,840
resistance and ohms a lot as well

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
there are a ton of free resources and

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,160
tables

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
available online and a great high level

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
overview is from

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,080
sparkfun's engineering essentials

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
so let's talk a little bit about circuit

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,360
basics

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,560
on the left-hand side you have a

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,240
a proper circuit so there's a power

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,919
source there's a resistor

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
there's an led and uh using a voltage

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,360
source

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
we can then add a load to the circuit

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
and

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
uh based on how the circuit is shown on

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
the left hand side

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
the led is going to light up so it's

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,479
exactly what we want

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,560
in the middle is a broken circuit so

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,160
if one of those components is not

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
connected to each other

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,199
there's no way for the electricity to

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,280
flow and so

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,880
your led is going to be off nothing's

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
going to happen

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,919
let's say that you end up with a

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
short circuit short circuit means

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,320
there's uh

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,199
infinite current and there's

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
nothing in the way to to power and in

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,320
that case

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
you might end up with too much power

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,160
going through the circuit

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,520
and might cause a short or worse

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,240
now a great way to conceptualize this

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,600
is an app that i found called eye

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
circuit 3d

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,120
it cost about 15 bucks unfortunately

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,160
it's only available

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,319
for iphone or ipad

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,840
and it features a lot of different

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,759
components that you can

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
drag around you can connect them

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
virtually and you can

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
simulate a circuit there are a bunch of

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
different templates

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
and this particular template is just two

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,840
batteries

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,000
a resistor and an led you can click on

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
the components to get more information

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,120
about them

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
so this is a working circuit but as soon

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
as i delete

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
that connection from the resistor to the

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,319
negative side of the battery our circuit

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,840
turns off

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,520
now let's say i zoom in and i delete

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,319
the resistor the resistor is going to

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,599
prevent

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,800
uh too much of a current hitting this

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,520
led

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,840
and when i reconnect that led directly

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,919
to the batteries without the resistor

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
we'll see that there's too much current

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,360
and there's a little animation of the

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,160
led smoking

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
so um this is a really great way like if

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,960
you're a visual learner like i am

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to conceptualize some of these topics

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
next up we have breadboards and they're

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
named breadboards because

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,520
back in the day um the way that people

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
would mock up their circuits would be

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,479
with

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,000
a board that they put bread on like a

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,360
cutting board and they would hammer

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,080
nails into it

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
and like wire stuff directly to it so

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,840
it's

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,759
retained its historical name but not

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,440
necessarily the same shape

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,319
so a breadboard is a no solder way

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,319
to connect components you might not be

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,360
comfortable with soldering you might not

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,120
own a soldering iron you might not want

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,440
to invest in one just yet

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
and if that's the case using breadboards

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,840
is a great

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,160
option the components that are used with

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,479
breadboards they need leads or legs

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,840
to be inserted into them and then

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,199
using jumper wires you can then connect

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,160
different components on your breadboard

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,599
to each other

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,360
just by using these wires

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,879
and this is awesome because it allows

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
you to reuse components

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
it allows you to prototype and test the

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
circuit

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,360
and if you need

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,919
components that uh that uh

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,279
have leads occasionally you can buy

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
those pre-attached

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,080
like i know that adafruit sells some

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,279
versions of their microcontrollers

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,680
um with soldered on you might

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,720
hear them called headers as well so they

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,800
have options for both

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
so all you need to do is hook up a power

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
source to your breadboard and you'll see

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,720
the red and

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,240
blue rails on the sides those provide

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
power and ground

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
and this is also kind of a great way to

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,279
have semi-permanent

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
projects there's nothing stopping you

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
from putting all these components

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,680
together and

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,600
using them on a breadboard

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,880
there's also an app called fritzing that

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,279
you can use to

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
diagram some of these things

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,640
conceptually

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
and then fritzing has libraries that

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,120
contain a lot of different components

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,320
that you might use

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
now soldering i want to say that

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
soldering is not

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,519
hard but making clean connections does

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
take

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,880
patience there are some

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,279
safety precautions that you have to

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,480
follow uh the tip of a soldering iron is

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,120
very hot

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,519
um there are safety considerations in

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,080
leaded versus unleaded solder

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
you definitely want to wear eye

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
protection

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
when you're soldering because little

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,080
pieces of

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,760
molten solder might come flying off

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
and you definitely don't want to get

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,440
that into your eye

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,040
and then you also don't want to breathe

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,360
the fumes you want to make sure that you

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,720
have good ventilation

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,160
so all of these kind of tend to

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,360
i think scare folks away from soldering

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,000
but really if you're able to have

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,640
someone teach you who already knows how

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,480
or when it's safe to do so you can take

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,560
a class in a maker space

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
you'll see that as long as you're

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,360
following all the safety precautions

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
it's actually really really

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,959
straightforward

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,600
um there are two resources that i like

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,480
uh one is the soldering is free comic

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
book which is

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,519
on the right hand side here um it's

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,200
free and it's uh illustrated it's a very

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,040
great in-depth guide

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
and then there's also the adafruit

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,600
in-depth guide as well as

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,760
videos that they've published and

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,839
soldering is going to allow you to make

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,279
more permanent connections between

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,680
components

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,399
now how do you add interactivity to your

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
project

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
because interactivity is what makes your

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,160
project fun

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
well there are lots of different ways to

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,279
do it you can add

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,720
buttons switches uh knobs

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,600
like potentiometers uh you can add

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
sensors

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,920
like for temperature air quality sound

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,839
and a lot more i do want to say that

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,079
if you buy a device or a microcontroller

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,519
that has sensors on board

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,360
chances are they're not going to be

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,920
quite as accurate

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
as specialty sensors that you can buy

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
separately

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,480
and then either solder them to your

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
microcontroller or

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,120
use a breadboard um for example there's

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,680
a sensor on the

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
microsoft uh sorry there's a sensor on

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,800
the

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,560
adafruit clue board for temperature but

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,120
because the component itself

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,040
runs very hot the temperature that's

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
detected tends to be a few degrees

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,440
higher

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
than the ambient air in the room

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
um and you might want to add

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,600
connectivity so

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,040
see if your board is wi-fi enabled you

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,720
can connect to the internet

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,639
you can log data you can hit apis

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,040
bluetooth is going to allow two

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,519
components to talk to each other via

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
bluetooth low energy so you can control

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,480
a microcontroller from

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
your phone or your computer or even have

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
two of them

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,440
talk to each other there's also

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,360
radio for situations where you might not

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,480
have internet but you want devices to

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,440
communicate over a longer distance

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
and you can also depending on what

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,240
connectivity you have

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,959
use things like api calls or even

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
triggers if your device is online you

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
maybe can trigger

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
different activities depending on sensor

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,680
readings

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,519
so i made a social battery led lanyard

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,639
and this was for conferences

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,480
so before covid started and the goal of

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,519
this project was to select

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,320
a social

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,120
energy or battery level from a touch

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,920
screen menu

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,399
on a badge that i'm wearing and then the

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,360
leds on that badge are going to change

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,519
color

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:26,560
depending on the selection

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,560
so let's take a look at that

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,519
this is created with a

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
pi portal pint as well as some

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,040
components

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,480
that allow me to use this device with

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,000
a battery so let's say that my social

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
battery is

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,120
green or um let's see

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,320
let's go back here it's a bit hard to

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
use this upside down

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,880
really hard to use this upside down

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,160
there we go

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,240
let's say my social battery is full so

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,600
that means that

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,320
i'm not tired i'm ready to talk

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:14,240
once i select full should see a green

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,320
green leds lighting up on this

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,240
lanyard here uh there are also states

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,279
for um if my social battery is empty

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
maybe i'm getting

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,240
tired or if my social if my social

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,560
battery is low maybe i'm getting tired

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,320
or if my social battery is empty

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
and i'm really tired and i don't want to

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,279
talk to anyone

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,800
that will flash these leds on

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,560
the lanyard to be read now i don't

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,440
expect to be going to any conferences

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,279
anytime soon but i think it would be fun

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,959
to repurpose this project to

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,120
for example indicate how open i am

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,880
to other people walking up to me on the

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,519
street

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,760
or add events you know maybe i want

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,160
people to keep their distance and i can

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,120
indicate that with red leds or maybe i'm

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,240
okay with

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,560
folks coming up to chat with me so um

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,880
this was a fun project and i definitely

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,000
think there are a lot of

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,880
interesting uses and implications

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,560
so let's take a look at the code for

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,120
this project

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,079
or rather some of it the whole code is

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,240
on

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,240
um is on github

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,680
so let's take a look at the code for

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
this project

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,360
um or some of the code because uh

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
the whole code it code base is available

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,759
on

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,320
github now the first thing

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,279
that you kind of have to know is this is

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,560
always running in a loop

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,680
and uh i'm listening this is the code

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,639
that kind of listens

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,720
for uh touches and then takes an action

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,880
depending on what was pressed

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,560
so i'm checking to see if there was a

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,639
touch and if there was

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,079
i'm gonna go through every button on

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
that main screen

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
and i'm going to check to see if that

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,320
button contains the x and y coordinate

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,759
of the touch then if that button

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,639
is in a group that has a background

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
associated

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,959
the status backgrounds are the ones that

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,920
display um

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,160
what the social battery status is then

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,600
it's going to

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,120
hide the what was visible

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
in the um or actually i guess it's in

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,839
reverse

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
a little bit confusing it's gonna show a

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
back button

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
it's gonna hide everything that was on

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,759
the main screen and then show that

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
correct background and show a back

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,560
button

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,320
so i can then toggle back and forth in

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,160
between the two states

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,360
and the code for this is available at

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,079
get dot io

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,079
social battery

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,240
the other project that i wanted to show

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,639
off and

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,360
you might have noticed me wearing it is

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
this

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
led jacket and this jacket is based on a

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,199
design

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,880
by sophie wong and

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,280
you can you can purchase her book

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
on wearables for just a few bucks or

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,839
download a free

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,520
pdf these hexagons are 3d printed on

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,199
fabric which is awesome

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,400
so i wanted to remix her design

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,240
and my goal was to be able to control

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
the jacket via bluetooth

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
and in this case i can actually control

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,520
the jacket from my phone

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,160
so i can change colors patterns and a

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,679
lot more

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,080
from my phone or my watch

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,679
and something else that i really like is

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,720
that the controller

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,880
and the battery for this

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,640
fit in a very very small package so i'm

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,320
just going to disconnect it for a moment

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,039
and show it to you this is the i believe

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,400
the

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,039
nrf52 feather

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,760
and then it's just in this 3d printed

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,600
case

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,600
all the files for 3d printing are

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,000
available to download for free

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
there's a convenient on off switch right

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
here

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,400
and then the battery is contained in the

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
smaller

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
box down here and all these components

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,799
snap together

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,919
and i was just able to solder on

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,520
a jst connector which then connects to

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
the leds in the jacket

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
so it's very easy for me to take out

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,520
this little bundle and

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
charge the battery the way that you

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,440
would connect

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:42,160
to this jacket is with the

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,679
bluefruit connect app um

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,679
that is present in uh it's for iphone

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,760
it's for android

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,280
so i'm just going to take a moment to

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:57,200
use my phone

00:18:51,280 --> 00:19:01,200
to connect to um this bluetooth device

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:05,679
and then i'm going to open up the

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:09,520
color picker and once i do that

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:13,360
i'm able to open the adafruit app

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,360
on my apple watch

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
and you can kind of see right here

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,240
so now that i've opened up the bluefruit

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,280
connect app on my phone

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,320
i'm going to be able to control

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,400
the colors or send color packets

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,039
from my apple watch right here to

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
my jacket so let's select this purple

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,720
color

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,320
and you should see my jacket changing

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,760
let's go ahead and select

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,080
green and you'll see the jacket changing

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,760
as well

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,799
so this is a it's a pretty fun party

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
trick

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,640
there are other kinds of controls that

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,280
you can send

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,480
so um there's a control pad

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,080
and i can use that control pad to

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,559
change the brightness on the animation

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,400
or change the speed that the animation

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,440
is playing at

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,440
or um change between

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,559
different animations and that's just

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,120
available here on my phone

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,400
so that's a pretty fun project um let's

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,600
take a look at some of the

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,880
code so this is the code around

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,799
the bluetooth connectivity so what i'm

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
doing here is instantiating

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,880
some of the components components that i

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,200
need and then

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,720
i'm sending out an advertisement from

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,799
the device in my pocket

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
saying that it's ready to be connected

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
to

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,240
once it is connected i'm going to start

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,320
the

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,280
um i'm going to start an animation

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,360
sequence

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
and i'm going to wait for packets from

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,120
this device

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,919
so when a packet comes in i'm going to

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,039
check to see

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,480
are you a packet that is of type color

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,000
packet and if it is i'm going to grab

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,640
that color value and

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,799
use that to change the leds if it's a

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
button packet for example

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,080
if this button if the right button was

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,200
pressed i'm going to use that as

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,280
a trigger to play the next animation

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
there's a lot of cool projects for iot

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,840
stuff which unfortunately i don't have a

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,720
lot of time

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,280
to dive into but two that are pretty

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,799
nifty

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,919
is one the pi portal iot

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,200
weather station on the left hand side by

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,760
uh brent rubell and the other one

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
is a pi portal that connects to azure

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,480
iot

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,280
and it uses it to uh monitor your plants

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
uh

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,480
health and it'll let you know if you

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,799
need to water your plant so

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,600
it tests the temperature and then it

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,120
also tests

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,799
the humidity in the soil using a special

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
type of sensor

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,000
and it can let you know how well you're

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,640
doing at watering your plant over time

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
so that the library for that was created

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
by

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,919
co-worker jim bennett and i highly

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,200
recommend checking it out

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,679
now some resources for continuing

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,120
on your own journey i wanna say you

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,159
should definitely follow

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,520
awesome makers one of my favorites is

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,000
odd jay

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,039
he recently was on the cover of make

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,360
magazine

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,640
and he creates like really cool

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,120
steampunk

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,120
robots and he has a companion robot that

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,039
he keeps on his shoulder

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,240
he's a really fun person to follow on

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,520
twitter

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,640
becky stern is an inspiration sophie

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,760
wong who created

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,120
the guide for making this 3d printed led

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,840
jacket

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,919
geek mom projects is awesome she's

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,120
constantly posting new stuff

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,159
stargirl flowers does a lot of work with

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,159
circuit python and synthesizers and then

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,520
the ruiz brothers

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,159
do a lot of cool stuff with circuits

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,200
and 3d printing and fabrication and

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,720
they're really

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,840
just so many other amazing makers

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,840
helen lay she makes

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,440
soft robots that light up and interact

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,159
and then christine sunu also makes

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,840
amazing robots that are really fun and

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
interactive so i highly recommend

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,679
checking all of these folks out

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,720
uh deborah geek mom projects she did a

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,400
great talk at pie cascades 2020 recently

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
uh where she talked about all of her

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,960
cool led projects so i recommend

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
checking that out on youtube

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,159
she's also the creator of something

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,960
called a bright bag

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,960
which is a programmable led bag

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,679
and it supports the micro bit and micro

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,480
python

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,559
or the adafruit clue and circuit python

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,039
and if you use the adafruit clue board

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,080
then you can use bluetooth and i

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,360
actually have

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,919
um one of her bags right here that i can

00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,919
show off

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,400
there's just a um let's get it turned on

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,320
there's just a front panel right here

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,400
that this board snaps into and

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,080
because i'm using the adafruit clue for

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,120
this i'm then going to connect

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,159
with bluetooth and i will show you

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:31,520
how to change the colors on this device

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,760
so i'm going to have to disconnect from

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,799
my jacket and connect to my purse

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,520
which is pretty fun and then select the

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,520
color picker

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:49,840
so i just changed my jacket and then

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,600
i'm going to connect to the purse and

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,120
i'm going to use the

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,440
color picker controller here

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,159
it kind of looks like this and then i'm

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,440
going to send

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,200
that same color to the purse and you'll

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,200
see that it changes

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,080
and now my purse and my jacket

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
match so a little bit of coordination

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,320
there

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,039
very fun for guides and help i recommend

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,919
instructables sparkfun adafruit learn
