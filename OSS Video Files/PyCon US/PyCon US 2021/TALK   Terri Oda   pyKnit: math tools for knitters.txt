Title: TALK   Terri Oda   pyKnit: math tools for knitters

Description: 
	Knitting patterns are effectively code that gives you a physical object if you execute them. Customizing and designing patterns takes a lot of math to get sizing and shapes right, but not all knitters love math, and even those who do don't want to do it by hand all the time. Every year at PyCon I meet a few more knitters, so I thought maybe this was the year we could put our heads together and build an open source knitting toolkit and maybe make customizing your knitting a little easier for everyone. The pyKnit toolkit will hopefully make it easier for people to adjust garment patterns to fit, for pattern designers to be size inclusive, or for any knitter to adjust patterns to make the most out of a special ball of yarn.
