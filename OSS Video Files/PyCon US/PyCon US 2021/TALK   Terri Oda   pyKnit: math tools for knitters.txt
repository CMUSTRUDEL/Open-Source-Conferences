Title: TALK   Terri Oda   pyKnit: math tools for knitters
Publication date: 2021-05-29
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	Knitting patterns are effectively code that gives you a physical object if you execute them. Customizing and designing patterns takes a lot of math to get sizing and shapes right, but not all knitters love math, and even those who do don't want to do it by hand all the time. Every year at PyCon I meet a few more knitters, so I thought maybe this was the year we could put our heads together and build an open source knitting toolkit and maybe make customizing your knitting a little easier for everyone. The pyKnit toolkit will hopefully make it easier for people to adjust garment patterns to fit, for pattern designers to be size inclusive, or for any knitter to adjust patterns to make the most out of a special ball of yarn.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,920
welcome to pilot

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,320
math tools for knitters hi i'm terry oda

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
i normally if you may be at a conference

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199
i would be talking about computer

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,800
security

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,679
maybe open source mentoring or

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,760
artificial intelligence but this year

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,200
i'm on sabbatical during pycon

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,680
so let's talk about knitting probably

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
if you're choosing to watch this talk

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
you have some idea what knitting is but

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,760
for those who want a refresher

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,360
knitting is a process in which you take

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
a long string

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,480
and turn it into a stretchy fabric by

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,399
making a series of interlocking loops

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,000
you're probably wearing some sort of

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,800
knit fabric right now

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,760
if you look really closely at a t-shirt

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
you will see

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,039
the same little v's that i have on the

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
bottom of my slide and that's the front

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,400
half of those little interlocking loops

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
t-shirt material is made by machine but

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,479
what we're going to be talking about

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
today

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,880
is the hand knit version where

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,000
you make the same fabric only bigger

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,000
out of yarn using pointy sticks if

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
you're thinking about tools for knitters

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
that's probably where you start you

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,880
start with

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
those pointy sticks sort of a classical

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
style here

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
with the ends or there's a variety of

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
other styles such as circulars where

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
they're connected by a long cord to let

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
you white

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
make wider fabrics of course then

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
there's

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,360
also the yarn which comes in a variety

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,159
of colors

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,320
and sizes and different materials

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,360
from there you might also consider

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,479
things like

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,399
pattern books or maybe

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,360
a tablet for taking digital versions

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
of your patterns out and about if you're

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,079
actually a knitter you probably picture

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
a few more things

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,080
so you picture sort of the bag that you

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,200
use for carrying all of your knitting

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
around in

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,599
you might picture things like scissors

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,959
for cutting the ends

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,959
measuring tapes or rulers

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,200
things like stitch markers for marking

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,680
different parts you're knitting

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
there's lots of different tools for this

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
hobby

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
what you might not be picturing

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,920
especially if you're not a knitter

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,760
is things like a scale for measuring how

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,280
much is left in a ball of yarn

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,160
or how much yarn a row takes or

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
things like the calculator app on your

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
cell phone

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,319
or a spreadsheet used for calculations

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,560
that's where this project comes in

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,640
so i found myself doing a lot of math

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
to end doing sort of the same type of

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,680
calculation over and over again

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,879
to customize my knitwear and after a

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
couple of times i thought

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,360
hmm why isn't there a library to do

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560
knitting math for me

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,680
so i made one it's called pi knit

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,200
it is written in python it's open source

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,920
and it allows you to do a bunch of

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,959
different types of knitting math

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
so to understand how this library works

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
you have to understand where you find

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,040
the math and knitting

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,879
number one gauge so

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
in a knitting pattern you will typically

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,480
see something that says

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,319
gauge it'll say a number of stitches 21

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,120
stitches 31 rows

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,159
is equal to 10 centimeters so the way

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,040
that you use this

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,879
is you catch cast on that many stitches

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,159
and you knit that many rows

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
and you produce something that looks

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
like a little square and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
then you wash it and you dry it and you

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
get

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,879
your special ruler or any ruler really

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
and you measure it and if you got

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,519
exactly 10 centimeters

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
then you're golden when you make your

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,840
knit

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,840
item all of the measurements that you

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
get will line up with what's written

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,959
in the pattern by the original designer

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,400
if you get it sort of close

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,040
you might try going up or down a needle

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
size trying a different type of needle

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,479
trying a different type of yarn until

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
you get it to match

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,919
if you can't get it to match or you want

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
to do something that

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,960
that the fabric just needs to be thicker

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,960
use a different

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,720
weight of yarn then you've got some

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,360
other options you might

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
do some calculations do that math to

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
figure out

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
what's going to fit and then choose a

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,600
different size

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,080
or you might end up doing calculations

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
to recalculate the entire

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
all of the dimensions of the knitted

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
object which is

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
a possibility maybe not people's

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,759
favorites so

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
speaking of the dimensions of a knitted

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,199
object

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,280
let's talk about shaping so there's lots

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,479
of cases especially in garments

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,240
where you're going to go from one

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
measurement to another you want to have

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,240
sort of a smooth increase so from like

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,840
the neckline to the shoulders

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,479
probably the simplest one to describe is

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,880
the sleeve shaping so you take a look at

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,600
your arm your bicep

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
and shoulder are much wider than your

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
wrist

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,919
and usually although you can do

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,800
different things for fashion

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
usually you want to have sort of a nice

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
long slow taper

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
from one measurement to the other so

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
that it fits sort of the curve of your

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
arm

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
if i wanted to say make my sleeve a

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
little bit longer

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
i might just add a couple of rows and be

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
done with it but if i wanted to

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
recalculate the whole thing there's

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
quite a bit to do

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,039
so you start with a bunch of different

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
measurements and what we want

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,240
is a knitting pattern that looks

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,160
something like i do

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
my decrease row i knit this number of

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
rows i do another decrease row and i go

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
on down until i get

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,680
to the smaller wrist size but then i've

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
got some constraints on that to make it

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,319
work

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
so i need to make sure that the number

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
of decreases i put in makes it so that i

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
go from this measurement to that

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,880
measurement

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,479
i need to make sure that i knit enough

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
rows in order to get the full length of

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
my arm

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
and then on top of that your

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
measurements are probably in centimeters

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
or inches

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,560
you're going to need to convert that to

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,720
stitches using again the gauge

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,160
you'll have to solve for the x and y

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
that's in this pattern but you have to

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
make sure to only use integers because

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,360
half stitches aren't really a thing

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
in this case and you have to work

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
out what to do with any remainder that

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,960
you have if it doesn't divide evenly

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,120
so it's a bit involved it can be a pain

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,240
moving on from just sort of the tube of

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
an arm

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,600
there's a bunch of different other

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
shapes you could look at in knitting

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,440
if we're talking about a flat item

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,479
here's a couple the simplest one being

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
the rectangle

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,440
your row length is exactly the same size

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,880
every time it makes a nice straight

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,479
item if you put an increase on one side

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
you end up with something that maybe

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,560
starts small and becomes

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,199
a triangle if you put an increase on one

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,280
side and a decrease on the other

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,440
you end up with something that tilts one

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,479
way or the other

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,759
and then on top of those sort of simple

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,319
geometric things we also have

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,319
shapes that take advantage of the

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
stretchy nature of the fabric

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,759
so for example if you started with a

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,319
triangle that's got increases on either

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
side

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,479
and you add more increases rather than

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,759
getting some weird three-dimensional

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,080
shape you actually tend to get a

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
crescent sort of a crescent moon shape

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,120
and similarly if you wanted to get a

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,759
circle

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
you can do it by adding concentric rings

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,120
of increases

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
at appropriate distances to still get a

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
big flat item

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
and of course you can also do 3d shapes

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,800
there's plenty more you can do

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,280
so if you're now thinking about

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
algorithms for this you may be thinking

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
well

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,080
okay uh it sounds like knitting is kind

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,000
of like code

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,520
and you'd be right so here's what a

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
knitting pattern looks like

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,199
there's two typical ways of showing a

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,160
knitting pattern charts and written

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
instructions

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
with the chart you basically take like a

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
graph paper

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
and fill in what stitch you're going to

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
do all the way across and then

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
all the way back you actually read them

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
changing directions

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
as you change the direction in your

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,479
knitting sometimes here's what that

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
looks like

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,919
as a physical item so

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,800
row 16 there we do a little bit of

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,120
knitting

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,240
we do a cable do a little more knitting

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
do another cable

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,159
we space those out evenly across the

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
whole fabric

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,279
and then there's the rest of the chart

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
you can see the big lines that were at

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,360
the top and the bottom

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
there's also written instructions where

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
it just says do this then do this then

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,720
do this then do this

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
patterns will sometimes have both

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
sometimes have only one

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
many knitters prefer one over the other

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,680
i'm a charts person i like the visual

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,600
lining up of things

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
if you're not familiar with knitted

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
shorthand

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,320
i've written what this instruction looks

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
like as

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
sort of python code pseudo python code

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,519
so you can see

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,640
we have a bunch of different individual

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,399
stitches

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,519
and those will

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,600
do different things you'll also see that

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
we have repeat sections we have loops

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,959
we have loops within knitting that

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
aren't related to the physical loops

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,560
that we've got

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
and you'll note that it takes up an

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,080
awful lot more space honestly

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
i sometimes really miss white space when

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
i'm looking at knitting patterns

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
but knitting patterns were designed to

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,320
be put on

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,440
in magazines basically in small print

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,519
options so they don't really they

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
they are very terse they're very small

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,399
it looks more like assembly code and

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,440
less like something in a

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,800
nice visual editor especially if you

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
have a classical computer science

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
education

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,360
you might be thinking hmm this sounds

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
sort of familiar i know there was a

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,959
thing about

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,120
symbols on an infinitely long tape

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,320
and you might be wondering is knitting

00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
turing complete

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,519
that's the description of a turing

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
machine and the answer is yes

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
but i will leave you to find that proof

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
on your own once we're thinking about

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
knitting as sort of a programming

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
language for

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,800
describing the creation of sort of

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,720
3d printed soft squishy objects

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,839
then you can see that there's some other

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
parallels

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,800
with computer software so one of those

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,800
is code reuse if you

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,920
look at a larger software project it's

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,959
often made up of

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
smaller individual components and the

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,399
same is true of some

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,000
larger or more complicated pieces of

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,079
knitting so for example

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,560
a sock would have sort of a cuff

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,800
a leg a heel toe

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
and if you take any one of these things

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,920
from one pattern say i like the heel

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,920
here where it's got a little bit of a

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,640
curve that's the arch of my foot

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,279
and i could replace the heel on another

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
sock

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,079
and add that in and get basically a new

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
sock pattern

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,160
similarly rather than having giant

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
standard libraries to use what we have

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,320
are

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,930
guides with different stitch patterns

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
for different textures so this is a

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,720
[Music]

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,160
stitch library and you can take those

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
and you could apply them to

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,519
any number of things you could apply

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
that to the sleeve of your sweater or to

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,680
a scarf

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
if knitting is math and knitting his

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,279
code which i think we

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,440
can see it makes sense that we could

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,560
describe it using a programming language

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,079
and maybe we could do something

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,959
interesting with it as a programming

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,839
language

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,640
but do we really need more knitting

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,399
tools i mean

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
knitting's been around for a long time

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,680
what why does it need programming

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
are we wasting our time and i don't

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
think the answer is right

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,639
yes i think this is still something

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,839
that's pretty interesting

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,360
so the thing that drew me to it was

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,079
doing

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,560
customization and

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,560
i think any person probably knows at

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
least one way in which your body differs

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,160
from the

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,000
the average so you might have sort of a

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,040
wider foot size you might be a little

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,639
bit shorter we might have broader

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
shoulders

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,040
and if that's the case then you are

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,639
going to want to customize your pattern

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
the thing about knitting is that it's

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,120
not like

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,920
all of these things are made usually for

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,800
one person

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,680
or one specific person there's no reason

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
you can't make it

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,920
match the measurements exactly there's

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,560
there's no need to

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,519
adhere to standard fashion sizing and

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,360
that's great

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
but again you have to be able to do the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
math and

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,600
a lot of people are very intimidated by

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,800
the math

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,480
so what they end up doing is either

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,320
they end up swatching endlessly and

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
trying to find the right thing that way

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
they might find that they end up making

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
sweaters that are just not the right

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,639
shape or size

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,800
because they didn't swatch well enough

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,880
or they just couldn't get it to match

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,959
you may find people who end up searching

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,480
endlessly for a pattern that includes

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,839
their size and includes their body

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,360
measurements so that they don't have to

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
do the math themselves

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,800
and some people just give up they say

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
well you know sweater knitting's too

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,160
hard i'm not going to do it

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
and i don't know about you but that

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
makes me kind of sad

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,519
the math isn't that complicated it

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,320
should be possible for people to make

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,279
perfectly fitting garments if they want

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
there's also

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
a larger discussion about size

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
inclusivity

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
in knitting and the two sides are

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
roughly

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,480
one it would be really nice if we had a

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
broader range of sizes available so

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,040
people could

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,880
always pick up a pattern and know that

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,839
it would fit their body

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,920
on the other hand knitwear designers are

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,920
not particularly well compensated

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,040
and doing all of the grading and the

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
math and the

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,440
test knitting and the editing to fit a

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,560
bunch of exercises in

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,680
is not it doesn't have a zero cost

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,279
it's not cheap so it would be nice to

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
have tools it would be nice to have

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
software

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,279
that helped you do this a little bit

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
more easily

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,880
either if you're a designer and doing a

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,639
whole bunch of these or if you're an

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,480
individual whose body just

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,560
has an interesting shape that you want

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,279
to customize for

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,040
the other thing that i had in my mind

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,040
when i started doing pine knit

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
was being able to make interactive

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,519
patterns

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,720
and if i were selling this to you as a

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,760
startup idea

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,360
i would tell you that this

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,320
is a groundbreaking

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,680
innovative solution disruptive to the

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,959
knitwear industry

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,760
and that you should give me all your

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,000
venture capital to

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,519
get into the ground floor of the the new

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
world of nit tech

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,920
but i'm not well let's be honest i'm an

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,880
open source hippie

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,920
and i'm on vacation right now so i'm

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,519
going to tell you that

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,279
interactive patterns are already a thing

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,920
that exists just not

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,920
in the form that i envisioned so it's

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,800
not uncommon when you get say a sweater

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
pattern

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,199
to have some worksheets in there where

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,639
you could fill in some measurements

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,720
and figure out exactly what sizing

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,959
changes you needed to make it wouldn't

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,959
be weird to see a note in a pattern

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,720
saying hey remember to weigh your ball

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,320
of yarn and figure out how much a row

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
takes to do so you can decide if you

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
want to do another repeat here

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,760
to use up the the very end of a perfect

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,760
ball of yarn

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,360
those are things that happen sometimes

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,040
people will direct you to

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
things like a little online javascript

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
calculator to do the math for you so you

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
don't have to sit there with your

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,639
calculator

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
and many designers are quite generous

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,279
with the formulas that they use

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,040
and explaining how to customize them so

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,800
you can go and read blog posts to hear

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,560
about how all that works

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,399
and if you don't want to do any of that

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,720
math yourself there's even

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,800
full like web application services you

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
can you can subscribe to

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
where you would enter your measurements

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
and get customized

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,360
patterns that will fit you exactly so

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,360
that's pretty cool

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
but the thing about all these tools is

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
they're very scattered you know each

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
person has a blog or a calculator or

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,360
whatever

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,839
not all of them stay maintained some of

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,639
them are

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
are costly and not usually particularly

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,160
costly but

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,600
they're built with the assumption that

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
you're a professional designer and that

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
you would be paying for this as a work

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
expense

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,360
and not you're just someone whose arms

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600
are really short who wants to

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,160
recalculate all of her sweaters

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
and so it'd be nice to have these things

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
to be free

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,839
there's also a lot of conversation in

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,399
the knitting community about

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,839
being fair to people who are at

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
different price points when they're when

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,160
they're

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,639
choosing their knitwear so things like

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
doing yarn substitutions really matter

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
the other thing is that it's not

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
something that's open source

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,199
and that matters to me because it's neat

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
to be able to

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,959
customize these things and build on

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,839
these things and work together

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,600
to build a larger library than maybe any

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,600
individual person could do

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,880
so i think that there's still

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,120
a space for this tool in not only

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,799
my personal toolbox but in sort of the

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,799
toolbox of the whole knitting world

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,799
so the next question is okay knitting is

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,319
math

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
we could use some new tools that will

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,760
make this easier and cheaper for people

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,079
to do why do it in python

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
what makes python the right choice and

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,039
of course the lazy answer is just that i

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,079
like python and i wanted to write

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,440
something in python

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,520
but i think we can go a bit deeper than

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,559
that

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,280
so when i go out to a conference

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,640
in real life or honestly when i go to a

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,559
virtual conference like this

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
i usually bring my knitting and i'm

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
hoping that many of you are knitting

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,960
during this talk right now

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
and if not you can pause it and go get

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
your knitting for the last few minutes

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,799
if you want

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,039
but the thing about knitting

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,320
in public is that it's a great way to

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
meet people if you're feeling a little

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,559
bit shy

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,919
you just bring out your knitting and

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,120
make it you know bring something

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,559
colorful and interesting

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,720
and then at the end of the talk people

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
will come over and say hi i saw you what

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
are you making

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
or look i've got my knitting too let's

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
compare notes

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,880
you know it it's really fun and

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,960
as someone who's been to pycon in person

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,320
many times i can tell you that there are

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,360
a lot of python people who know knitting

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,960
who do knitting who you know care about

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
someone who does knitting you know ask

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
questions

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
because my grandma can i take a picture

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,960
to show my grandma sort of things

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,640
so if i'm choosing a language for

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
a project that i'm hoping will be open

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,440
source i want people who

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,720
speak both of these languages who will

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
feel empowered to

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
make changes and interested in making

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
changes in what we're doing

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
so i think python is the right language

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
it's definitely not the only language

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,600
for this but it's definitely

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,440
one that i know will work for what i

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,720
want

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,640
the other reason that i went with python

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,880
is really project jupiter and

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,919
jupiter has this nice interactive

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,799
notebook thing

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,760
that when i was in grad school basically

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,919
transformed

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,320
the way that we shared data with each

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,960
other and we generated graphs and

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,360
and got to explore the results we were

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,559
getting

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,960
in the scientific world and so when i

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
think

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,000
of ways to have interactive code

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,360
and data and and charts

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
even though we're talking about knitting

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,120
charts as opposed to pie charts or

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
you know scatter plots or whatever the

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,679
first thing i think of is

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,799
is jupiter and those notebooks is this

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,120
the best choice for all knitting users

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,480
probably not i mean honestly if you're

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,400
afraid of the math

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
you're probably not going to want to set

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,160
up jupiter lab yourself you're not going

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,000
to know how to do that

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,559
but baby steps here so i want to make it

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,640
easy for people who do know this stuff

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,080
to sort of play around with it and see

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
how it works and maybe we'll develop a

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,960
really cool library

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,400
and if we get a really cool library and

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,880
we want to

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
bring it to more people then you plug

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,760
the library into a different user

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
interface and you'd have a lot of

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,320
options

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,600
so i think it's really important as part

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,919
of the story

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
for development and the story for

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,440
exploration

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,799
of this whole idea to to have

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,799
interactive notebooks like this

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,679
so your next question might be how does

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,240
it work

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,200
and the answer is okay it doesn't do a

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
whole lot yet

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,480
i've only been working on it in the

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,039
public from front since

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
since december but let's go back to

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,440
talking about

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,120
our sweater sleeve example so

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,120
if i wanted to customize a sweater

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
sleeve i'm going to import the pine nut

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
library

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,000
it's got an option for swatching so i

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
fill in my swatch measurements

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
so if you take a look at those numbers

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,400
which you can see on the screen

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,880
you'll see that i didn't get the perfect

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
square in in inches it's usually four by

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
four so you can see

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
what i got was four by 3.25 so it was

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,799
sort of rectangular

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,120
so i already know that the numbers i get

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,240
are not going to match what we have in

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
the rest of the pattern i'm going to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
have to do some calculations

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,200
but then on top of that i'm looking for

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,480
something very specific

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,360
so i wear a a fairly large fitness

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,760
tracker

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,200
and i really hate it when my sweater

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
gets caught on it i don't know why it

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,039
doesn't

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,640
it doesn't feel right to me so i wanted

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,799
to make a sweater with an

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,679
abnormally short sort of bracelet length

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
sleeve

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,200
so that it wouldn't be over top of my

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,200
tracker all the time

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
so i plug that into my swatch

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
measurement i say

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,520
do my measurement okay i want it to be

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,240
11 inches from here to here

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,320
and it calculates how many rows i need

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,120
in this case it's 61

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,080
and then i take that and i plug that

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
plus my

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,320
various arm measurements into the

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,360
equation to generate sleep decreases

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
and poof again a pattern it looks kind

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
of like the one we described in the

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
sleeve

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,919
section so you do decrease row do seven

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,440
more rows another decrease row seven

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,440
more rows and so on

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,120
and then to deal with the fact that they

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,080
didn't divide evenly i have another set

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,840
where it's only six rows in between

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,360
pretty cool that looks like a thing you

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,559
can knit and so

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,919
i did so this is the sweater

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,720
that i made using my customized

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,320
sweater sleeves as you can see i have

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,280
successfully made my

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,360
my uh sweater sleeve a little bit short

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,120
so it doesn't doesn't interfere with my

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,400
watch and it's exactly

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,840
what i was hoping for pretty cool

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,640
i was pretty excited when this worked

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,240
what's next for pine knit well i can do

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,600
the sweater sleeves

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,600
and i can do the sweater body

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,120
customizations but i haven't quite

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
figured out the math for the shoulders

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,880
yet

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,720
so once that's done we'll be able to

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,320
have a full interactive pattern which i

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,080
think will be pretty neat

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,679
i've got ideas about generating

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,559
component shapes

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
and doing texture fills i've got a whole

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,600
bunch of ideas about how to do

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,799
charts and honestly i could use some

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,000
help with that i'm not the strongest at

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,840
any of the charting tools in python i

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,039
could also use some help with art assets

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,919
i think there's a lot of interesting

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,400
things that we could

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,640
add in that way and there is so much

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,600
testing and error handling to do

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,760
and documentation and honestly just

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,039
seeing how it works in real life

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,480
it'll be pretty neat but it is a thing

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
that you can get right now

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,600
if you want to try it out you can pip

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,640
install pine it

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,840
or you can get it from github and if you

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,799
want to join me

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,320
contributors are always welcome i love

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,360
meeting new people and i love working

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,159
with people

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,320
and i'm on vacation so now's a great

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,320
time

00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:05,840
that's all thanks for listening and

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:05,840
happy knitting

00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,840
