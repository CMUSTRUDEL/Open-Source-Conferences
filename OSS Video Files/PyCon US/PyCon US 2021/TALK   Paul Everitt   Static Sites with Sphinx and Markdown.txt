Description: 
	Everybody knows Sphinx for documenting projects, Python and otherwise. But few think of Sphinx for the rest of a website.

Why? Because Sphinx traditionally means authoring with reStructuredText instead of Markdown. While RST is very powerful, it's a bit quirky, and nowhere near the popularity of Markdown.

But with the arrival of full Markdown support MyST, and with static site generators having a renaissance, it's time to give Sphinx a second look. Sphinx is an "information-rich" static site generator, with rich linking and many other features for authoring a knowledge base.

This talk introduces Sphinx for websites, shows enabling MyST for Markdown, and compares what it has to offer versus other approaches. Weâ€™ll do a light treatment of customization. All the material in this talk comes from a published tutorial.
