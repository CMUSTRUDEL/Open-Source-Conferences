[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
welcome to python

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,199
the next generation or as fans fondly

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,439
refer to it

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,880
p tng hi everyone i'm meg ray and you

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,920
can find me at

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,160
teach underscore python on twitter

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,399
so i started out as a special education

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
teacher and my experience learning to

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
program for the first time

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,280
at a local python meetup was the impetus

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
to shift gears of my career into

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,559
computer science

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,559
education so now i teach computer

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
science education i research computer

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,800
science education

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
um i'm an author instructional designer

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,199
and educator

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,360
i will be available in the chat for the

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,079
whole presentation so please feel free

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,879
to put any

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,879
questions there

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,479
so today i'm going to go over some of

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
the current trends in python education

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,119
efforts

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,520
you'll be introduced to the brand new

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
python and education website

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
gain a few strategies and resources for

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
teaching

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,320
and connect with a whole community of

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
python educators

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,360
so let's start with what's happening now

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,680
in education so

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
let's take a look at some trends in

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,479
general computer science education that

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,759
are

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,439
influencing um how python is used in

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
education

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,200
so the first is the increase

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,720
in computer science for all initiatives

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,880
now this can happen on a national level

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,640
or if you're somewhere like the u.s it

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,640
could be happening on a state a more

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
local level

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,040
but what these initiatives are um

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,840
is a requirement that

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
every student receive computer science

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
instruction

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,320
whether that's dedicated um a dedicated

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
class

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
or whether it's integrated into another

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
subject

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,319
area but that every student received

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,560
this instruction

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,840
during the regular school day um

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
and so this is a shift towards equity

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,560
because

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,239
it ensures that it's not just an

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
elective where students can

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,200
opt in or they have to choose between

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,760
computer science and something else

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,879
but rather that every student receives a

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
baseline

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,360
of exposure and understanding to the

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
field of computer science

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,920
um and then the other

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,319
trend um is that there are shifts in

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
computer science 100 classes or intro to

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,040
computer science at the college

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and university level so just briefly

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
there's an increase

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,480
in cs for non-majors courses and some

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,080
universities are

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,480
even starting to require cs as a general

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
graduation requirement and then there's

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,519
also some shifts and rethinking

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,560
in intro to cs for majors at some

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,400
universities as well

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,440
so in both of these cases python

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
is is being used itself as a tool for

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,879
equity

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,680
and what i mean by that is that

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,080
selecting

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
python as the programming language to

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,519
introduce computer science is a

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,000
deliberate choice

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,760
to support equity for all learners

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,640
so let's take a look at why that is

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,599
so this trope might make you groan the

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,080
whole

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
python is the same thing as pseudo code

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,959
thing

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
and we could get into a nuanced

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,840
discussion about that but instead i just

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,360
want to focus on how this feature

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,599
um is actually a strength of python

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
and the driving force behind python's

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
popularity in education and it is

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,000
popular

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,760
as a matter of fact i had a teacher make

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
a comment to me once about how

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120
establishment

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,480
python is because it's just so

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,080
ubiquitous

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,560
um in the secondary education space so

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
let's take a closer look at why this is

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
the case

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,440
the first piece that we've been talking

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
about is readability

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
so we know that reading and tracing code

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,120
contributes to students

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,560
understanding and programming um

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,600
and python is very readable for students

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,919
and teachers there's also

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
a lot of availability of educational

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
resources that are

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,240
out there online for teachers to find

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,600
python is flexible students can create

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,680
projects from different domains teachers

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,120
can use different

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,080
programming paradigms so there's a lot

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
of flexibility

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,960
in its use um also because it is popular

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,240
in industry uh used in industry

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,160
especially data science

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
students are very drawn to that they

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
want practical skills they want to feel

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
like they're doing something real which

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,840
they

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
are um and teachers are also drawn to

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,759
that because they feel like they're

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,039
giving their students valuable skill

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,840
um next it is highly compatible with

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,120
another trend in education which

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,560
is data literacy and trying to push data

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,400
literacy

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
so teachers can teach programming

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,280
with python at the same time as their

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
increasing data literacy

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
and finally there is a really strong and

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,919
active community around python

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,840
now that is uh part of the reason that

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
so many educational resources are

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,320
available

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
but it's also something that in the

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,240
education world it's

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
it's not really uh it's sort of below

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,360
the surface people

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,039
aren't aware of it so we're getting a

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,560
huge influx of python users um

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
and they're coming from all different

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,120
places in education

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,520
first we're getting students who are

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,639
required to learn python

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
in school right so a whole bunch of

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,280
secondary

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
secondary school students or sixth to

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,800
twelfth grade

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
also teachers so this isn't just

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,280
computer science teachers

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,759
but we need computer science teachers so

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,720
quickly

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,560
that we don't have time to wait for new

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
cs teachers to come up through the

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
pre-service pipeline

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
and a lot of times there's not even a

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,919
pathway to train those teachers from

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,880
pre-service

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,080
so many teachers of other subject areas

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,199
are learning

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,319
uh to program in python

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,479
also because of all this

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
after school programs camps things like

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,360
that are of course increasingly more

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,919
popular

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,759
uh for programming so we're getting

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
students from that

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,520
we talked about the trends at the

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,319
college university level so getting

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,520
people from all different majors now

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,840
for that and then

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,440
because of all this all all of these

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
things are driving

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,919
the production of a lot of online

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
education resources

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,759
which is increasing the likelihood that

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
an independent learner is going to come

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,720
across

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,840
python materials online so these are

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,240
some of the areas

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,360
and this new generation of python users

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
is more diverse

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
in every sense of the word than ever

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,599
before

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
um and as a community we are also

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,360
becoming

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,319
more diverse but i would say that even

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
the attendance

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,840
of pycon us 2021

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,400
does not reflect the same demographics

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,400
as this new generation of python users

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,240
so as a community we have

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,280
many opportunities now and in the near

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,879
future

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,240
to engage this next generation

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,280
um and we want to move them from

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,720
yeah i programmed in python once

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,400
to active and contributing members

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,400
of the python user community

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
so considering everything that we've

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
talked about

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
about this next generation of python

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919
users

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,000
as a community we have to think about

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,479
how will we connect them

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,680
um how will we widen our circle

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
how will we welcome and engage this next

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,240
generation

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,279
so i think that will require

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,560
some community discussions and

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,600
community thinking around

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,000
what we want to stop doing

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,640
as a community what we want to start

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
doing

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,240
as a community and what we should

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,920
continue to do

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,279
as a community um and really examining

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
what parts of our culture are

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,080
essential to this community and we

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,040
should help onboard people too

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,519
and which parts are not as essential

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,680
that

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
we may want to dispense with going

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,519
forward

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,640
so there's a lot of thinking

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,519
and working out and working together

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,519
to be done here

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
all right so let's move on to within the

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,160
python community

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,959
what are the education related things

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,959
that are happening

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,519
so let's take a look at a few of these

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,560
current efforts

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,680
the first is pycon always has the

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,839
an education summit and training summit

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
other pycons may have that as well so

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,880
for example pycon uk

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,839
has an education track that runs

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,160
throughout the conference

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,680
um the psf is also supporting

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,000
um some educational programs so

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
for example in 2019 they gave out

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
education grants

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,920
and this year they supported the hidden

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
genius project

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,000
and incorporating python into their

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,399
curriculum

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,440
then there are many many open source

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,519
projects related to education

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
so just to name a few there's beware

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,040
which

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
received one of the 2019 education

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,160
grants

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
there's edublocks which helps students

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,440
transition from block based coding to

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,360
python

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,640
and there's ppb which is an educational

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,480
game development engine um and then we

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,760
have some other projects which

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,120
within the community uh for example the

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,399
teaching python podcast

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,480
and i am excited to announce a project

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,120
that i've been working on

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
which is a new landing page for python

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,880
in education

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,200
before we get into the page i want to

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,720
just acknowledge what a community effort

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,600
this has been first this was funded

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,440
by the psf through a 2019 education

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,560
grant

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,800
also nick tollerby

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
encouraged me to submit the proposal for

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
the grant

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,600
and also passed on the work that he

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
and other contributors did to the

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,800
original python and education page

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
a few years ago

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,560
i also want to thank sumana harihara

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,320
swara

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,959
um sumana reminded me at a really vital

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
point

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,640
um that i had community around me and

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,640
was not alone

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,639
finally i want to thank shanna gordon

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,839
mckeon

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
shawna is the one who developed the site

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,079
so you can find it at

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,720
education.python.org

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,279
and i'll give a tour in just a moment

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
but

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,720
just an idea of what you can do with

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,079
this site um

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,880
one you can find resources for teaching

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,720
python

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,959
that's the number one question that i

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,519
get what are the resources

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,839
i can use to teach python well your

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,399
answer is here

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,720
you can also contribute resources that

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,920
you've created or that you know of

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,440
um you can learn uh

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,760
all sorts of things about teaching

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
python including inclusive teaching

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,240
strategies

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,519
you can connect with others who are

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
interested in python

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
in education and you can also contribute

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,800
because this

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:56,240
is an ongoing open source project

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,240
so let's take a look

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,320
so here's the landing page and we have

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,240
um

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,839
several different options in the top

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,480
menu bar

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:12,320
so if you have a specific

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,639
problem of practice or you're new to

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,560
education and aren't sure where to start

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
or even new to python and not sure where

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,720
to start

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,399
um this page is full of tool kits

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,399
and guides for different um audiences so

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,399
one that we'll look at today what works

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,240
in teaching python that's evidence-based

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,959
strategies for teaching

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
um a toolkit on how to take action to

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,639
advocate for cs instruction

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,920
um a guide to inclusive practices

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:46,160
and um a guide to choosing

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,160
a platform for teaching python

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,040
then we get to the resources

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,800
now if you just want to say fine i need

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,160
some lesson plans you know i need a

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,160
curriculum

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,920
uh this is the place to go you can

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,360
search by keyword um

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
you can filter uh by some of the topics

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,800
up here

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
to hopefully find what you're looking

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,279
for um

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:20,560
so let's take a look at python snacks

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,320
so when you go here you will see

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,320
um any information

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,240
i'm signed in so you won't see edit this

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,399
resource

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,360
but you'll find information about who

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,959
created this

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,000
about uh what it is um and you'll be

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:45,839
able to link

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,839
uh to go directly to that resource

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,720
so here you can also contribute a

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,760
resource

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,920
these are all either open

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,959
open source projects open education

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
resources or

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
free resources

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,120
next you can go to the forum to connect

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,240
with others

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,440
this is a great place to start you can

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,720
ask questions of the community

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
and connect with others

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,240
okay and then you can also find out um

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,279
other ways to get involved and connect

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
with other people

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,839
so um through social media

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:36,000
and different communities that exist

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,839
online you can see some of the

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
tweets happening that are related to

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,480
python in education and then

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,839
also get information about how to

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,279
contribute

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
to the open source project

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,560
and finally of course there we abide by

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:58,240
the psf code of conduct

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,920
so let's take a deeper dive

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,279
into a couple of the features

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,560
so let's take a sneak peek at one of the

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,639
at a couple of the toolkits so

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
these are common questions that i get

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,800
where do i start

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,279
where can i find some fresh ideas which

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,360
resources are actually worth my time

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,800
and my students are stuck what can i do

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,880
well now you can go to the what works in

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,480
teaching python toolkit

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,759
or as i like to call it pedagogy

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,079
um so some of the concepts

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,800
or strategies in the toolkit include

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,440
something called

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
prim concept before code tell the story

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,079
sub goal labeling

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,279
let's just look at one of those so prim

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,639
that stands for predict run investigate

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,320
modify make this is a

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,720
means of planning um

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,839
for programming instruction and it's

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,399
meant for

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,880
learners at all different stages in the

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,839
learning process so not just novices but

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,280
also learners at intermediate and more

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,760
advanced levels

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,640
um so in the toolkit you will get a

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,039
summary

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
explaining what this is you'll get out a

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,880
link to

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,600
resources on how to implement it and

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,600
you will also see a python related

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,319
example for each one

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,120
so the example for this is the new intro

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,840
to python teaching curriculum

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,039
that replit offers and that was created

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,320
by andrew colley

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,320
who you can find on twitter

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,400
so let's take a look at what this looks

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,240
like

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,559
predict and run so here you can see

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,919
he has comments giving instructions so

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,559
task one

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,200
add a comment on line seven to predict

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,320
what the code in line eight will do

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,520
so i would as a brand new novice coder i

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
would make a prediction

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,720
about what this line of code would do

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,160
and then i would run it

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,640
to see if i'm correct

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,120
next is the investigate phase so this is

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,280
a guided investigation where i'm testing

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,480
out different things about the code

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,000
um so some of the questions is here what

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,440
would the output of the code

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,720
print quote i love computing be

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,160
and then there are

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,039
examples um with the syntax slightly

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,200
different for each

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,440
and students uh investigate and put

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,440
their answers as comments

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,600
finally there's the modify and make

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,080
phases so

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,799
modify you're going to actually reuse

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,799
that same line of code

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,919
but change up the string to make it your

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,400
own

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
and finally make you're going to create

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,320
your

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,880
own um part of the program

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,960
so this is just one example of an

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,280
evidence-based strategy

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,240
that is featured in this toolkit

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,039
so let's take a peek at one of the other

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
toolkits

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,160
so this is from the act take action

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
toolkit

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,240
um different toolkits have different

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,919
primary audiences so this is really a

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
guide for tech companies and

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
professionals

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,760
um though many different people can

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,760
benefit from it

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,799
so it talks about ways that you can

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,679
advocate support and collaborate

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,799
to advance computer science education at

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,799
the secondary level

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
so and i just want to say that all of

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,679
the resources

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,640
are linked and currently available on

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,080
the website

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,600
in the toolkit itself um they're just

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,840
removed here for simplicity

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,360
so one of the first actions that you can

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,000
take is

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,960
advocating for computer science

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,240
education

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,720
at the secondary level and

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,679
in the toolkit it has resources like

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,480
local policy guides

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,880
or template letters to write a letter to

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,880
a school principal

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,159
next in the toolkit you can find

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,159
resources

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,960
that companies can use to support

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,440
computer science education

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,840
so things like resources for how to

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,360
volunteer as a team to run

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,799
an hour of code event um how to promote

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,400
visibility of different

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,280
um developer related careers

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,559
um information about hiring and

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,559
supporting first-time

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:44,159
interns and information about donating

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,600
either devices or software to schools

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,559
and finally resources for individuals to

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,080
collaborate with educators

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,520
in cs education so you'll see links to

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,280
organizations where you can volunteer

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,520
ways to contribute to open source

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
projects i want to

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,559
just take a few minutes on these last

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,600
two so

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,919
uh one be visible if you

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,640
are someone who is part of a group that

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,280
is

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,000
underrepresented or not visible in some

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,200
way

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,799
in the field of computer science or

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,919
software engineering

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,600
i encourage you to consider making

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,280
yourself visible to

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,280
students especially younger students

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,120
our young students in primary and

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
secondary school they need to be able to

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,080
see themselves

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,000
um in this career and

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,559
instead of saying oh that's for somebody

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
else that's not for someone like me

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,960
um so if they can see themselves in

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
you you know you may make a big

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
difference

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,840
in what they choose to study what they

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
think that they can

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,000
study and ultimately their career

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,000
choices

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,720
and finally find a way to be a mentor

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,080
at work whether i'm not talking about

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,960
mentoring a young person

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,320
which is also important um i'm talking

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,240
about either formally

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,200
or informally mentoring new colleagues

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,840
mentoring people who are new um to the

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,360
career

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,080
just coming in um because

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,760
it's not only important who we recruit

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,280
recruit and hire

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:31,200
but it's important to

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:34,559
retain people and mentoring

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,000
can help do that so

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,480
i encourage you to check out the site

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,720
and participate in the community

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,360
um you can find the site at

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,039
education.python.org

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,799
and if you're interested in contributing

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:57,039
check out the github

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,039
which is psf slash python python-in-edu

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
and finally you are all invited to join

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,080
our mentored

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,200
sprint which is sunday may 16th from 12

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,760
to 4 p.m and

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,919
everyone is welcome here so if you want

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,559
to make technical contributions to

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,600
the website you are welcome if you're

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,400
interested in making

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,679
content contributions about education

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,320
you are welcome

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,000
if you've never contributed to anything

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,559
please come join us

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
if you just want to hang out and talk

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,039
about education

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,360
please come join us you are welcome here

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,320
um i will be available this whole time

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,720
as well as some of my colleagues

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,720
to help mentor anyone who would like it

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,279
and i'll just close with this thought

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,640
worldwide we are literally inventing

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,320
computing education

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,880
in schools as we go along so

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,760
that's a little bit of a scary statement

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,760
but it's also

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,120
an awe-inspiring statement because we

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,320
have this

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,559
one opportunity to start

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,600
from the ground up with equity in mind

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,880
with inclusion in mind to really

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,880
shape what is computing education

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
at the secondary level going to look

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,159
like

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,880
and now is our chance to seize that and

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,880
influence it

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,480
so thank you for your time today i would

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:47,840
love to hear from you

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:47,840
so feel free to reach out thanks

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,919
