Publication date: 2021-05-29
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	NumPy has grown to be a vital part of the data science workflow for everyone from astrophysicists to zoologists. This talk is about how PyTorch approaches being “NumPy-compatible,” and why the PyTorch community thinks that’s important, why it can be challenging, and why sometimes it’s necessary to be divergent from NumPy’s behavior.
