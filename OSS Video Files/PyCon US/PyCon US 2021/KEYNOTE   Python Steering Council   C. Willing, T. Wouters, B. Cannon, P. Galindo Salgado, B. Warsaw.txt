Elected as prescribed in PEP 8016, the Python Steering Council is a 5-person committee that assumes a mandate to maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter, improve the contributor experience, formalize and maintain a relationship between the Python core team and the PSF, establish decision making processes for Python Enhancement Proposals, seek consensus among contributors and the Python core team, and resolve decisions and disputes in decision making among the language.

This keynote will update the community on current and future initiatives. Additionally, the Steering Council will address community questions collected prior to the conference.
