Title: TALK   Susan Shu Chang   Narrative-focused video games development with Ren'Py an open source engine
Publication date: 2021-05-29
Playlist: PyCon US 2021
Description: 
	The game engine, Ren'Py, is an open source engine used to make countless interactive fiction games, also known as visual novels (VNs). These include commercial hits with VN elements such as Persona 5, to viral works such as Doki Doki Literature Club (2mil+ downloads as of Jan 2018).

I learned to program in Python using this engine, and have released my commercial game with it after working for a few years on it during weekends, selling 6K+ copies in less than half a year. In the daytime, I work as a principal data scientist in fintech.

Anyhow, the talk will dig into the source code of the engine, https://github.com/renpy/renpy, such as:

How it takes care of OS level stuff for game developers, memory optimization, cross platform game saves, and all that cool stuff.

Outcome: The audience will understand the independent gaming industry and how they can use Python to break into the industry, as I share my journey. There will also be components of source code walkthrough, but will be more of an overview than a step by step tutorial due to the scope of the talk.

i actually work as a principal data

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
scientist at

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,079
clearco which is a fintech company that

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,440
provides fast and flexible

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
funding for startup primarily e-commerce

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,120
and helps them grow and succeed

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,920
and i also write weekly on data science

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,039
and game development uh kind of like

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,960
these to do

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,160
posts and stuff on my blog susanshu.com

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,600
and i make open source contributions

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,920
primarily in python related stuff and

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,799
it's been pretty fun that's a little bit

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
of a fun fact in 2019 i spoke at python

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,560
canada

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,840
in person 2020 i spoke at pike on india

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
remotely and now i'm

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,799
coming to your screen from here

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,119
to python us in 2021 so i think

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
it's pretty cool a little bit about

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
myself on the game dev side which is

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,079
kind of

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
why i'm giving this talk in the first

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,640
place is i'm the founder

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
and the only developer in quill game

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,640
studios

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
and apart from being the developer i

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
wear all the hats

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,320
pm writer marketing

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,840
biz dev etc etc

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,320
um i started my

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,399
ideation for my first commercial game

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,759
that means i'm going to sell it

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
in 2017 so that was quite a few years

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,600
ago

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,680
um so it started with these scattered

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,960
google docs and the old ones i could

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
find were from

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,879
late 2017 but i

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
know i had some local like word docs or

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,720
something

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
um probably from earlier and then i

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,879
moved

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,560
the story which actually ended up

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,520
being 70 000 words in english

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,599
um in scrivener which is like a kind of

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
script writing

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
software that you can see on the

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
screenshot on the

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,720
right side of you um so

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,720
now i have the story how do i get this

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
idea from a story which has like the

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
logic

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
of the story um of the game and stuff

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
like that

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,599
to the actual game how do i do that um

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
it took me two years and i'm going to

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
share here how python

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
helped me and how this open source

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
engine renpi

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,440
has helped me and i'm really excited to

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,319
you know tell you about it

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,080
so what's this game it's a it's called a

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,159
summer with the shiba inu and it's a

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
visual novel made in renpi and it's

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,120
shipped

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,720
on all kind of main os's like windows

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,760
mac os linux as well as all consoles at

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,200
the time which are

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,800
switch xbox one and ps4

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,640
and actually on the console launch it's

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560
in the first six months it's actually

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,000
sold

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,560
10 000 or so copies

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
and that was really more than i ever

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
expected

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,080
and it's all thanks to just like playing

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
around with rimpai and spending a

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,120
massive amount of time

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,360
writing games so uh

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
i want to share how you can do that with

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
you

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
first of all though i'm going to give an

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
overview of the gaming industry because

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
there's very

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,120
different ways that one

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,120
as a programmer as anything else can

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
enter the gaming industry

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
um you don't have to do it like i did

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,519
i'll describe some of the

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
kind of traditional ways and

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,159
non-traditional ways

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,519
um so there are of course like different

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,519
platforms depending on what you're

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,120
interested in you want to do

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,239
like computers or consoles

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,519
um so there could be like steam

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,440
or hio which is a kind of

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,560
small online platform for

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,360
computer games that is for smaller

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479
studios

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,000
those are options as well um i shift my

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,880
game on all of these

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,800
but just for your consideration console

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,960
game development is quite different

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,080
from um just like the other

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
pc platforms

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,680
and okay there are different

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,360
types of studio sizes as well

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
so i'm going to talk about the

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,639
traditional kind of gaming route which

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
is

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
aaa studios that just means studios with

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,960
very massive

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
uh kind of head count budget and

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,080
everything so

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,199
you think ubisoft or blizzard activision

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,280
they could be making games like fifa

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,360
uncharted the last of us assassin's

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
creed you name it a lot of the games

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
that you

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
have heard of most likely and these

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,120
studios make the most

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
well-known games with the highest budget

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
and they could be pushing the boundaries

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
of

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520
technology because they are partnered

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,639
with nvidia or amd

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,880
and their games are purchased and

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,080
played by millions of people but the

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
thing is like to

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
make a single one of these games there's

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,639
like

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,440
tens of thousands of developers artists

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,840
everything else on the project and each

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,400
person will take care of

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,080
mostly one small thing unless you're

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,840
like the head producer

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,319
or like someone like more high up um

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,520
so for example that you might be coding

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
um just like

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,560
the code for one specific type of gun or

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
like

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,319
one specific rope mechanic which is the

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,199
case in the last of us two

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,919
um you could be making one small part of

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
a quest

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,600
design like pick up three feathers to

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,360
proceed and that's like the only thing

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,400
you'll be touching in the whole game

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,960
that's possible in a triple a studio

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,039
and the success of these games are more

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,360
like movies where they

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,280
spend millions and they expect to make

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
millions but they could still be at a

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,720
loss

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,960
the successful ones make extreme amount

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
of dollars but since that's distributed

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
over

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
the company and so many people um it's

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
very

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
like you know people kind of expect to

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,240
make the money

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
like they're full-time just like their

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,680
full-time salary they don't

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,680
necessarily get a windfall i'm talking

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,800
as if you're just a normal ic

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
like an individual contributor in a

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,440
aaa studio and just to kind of

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
illustrate the kind of budgets that are

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
being spent on

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
aaa you can see like one of the call of

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,360
duty games

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,639
uh had 250 million

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,759
usd spend in terms of development costs

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,960
and marketing and uh gta

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,560
5 had around the same ballpark

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,840
uh cyberpunk 2077 had

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,479
like over 300 300 in which probably a

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
lot was

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,960
in marketing as well but yeah those are

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,639
some things that are common in the

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
gaming industry but for me

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
right as a developer as a small

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,160
developer

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
as a new developer i'm like i want to

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,560
make games but i don't have

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,599
millions right what can i do

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,800
um thankfully there is another

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,319
way to make games and be successful um

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
and if you want to do it for fun that's

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,599
fine but if you want to think about like

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,800
financial returns and stuff um

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,319
indie studios have grown in popularity

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
over the last uh

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
decade or so they're just smaller

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280
studios

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,520
lower budget much smaller like

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,720
they could actually on the extreme be

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,520
one person

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,039
so for example in the case of stardew

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
valley which has like

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,680
millions in sales it started out as one

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,919
person after it sold like

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,919
millions of copies i i know they've been

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,840
bringing on people to like port the game

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,199
and stuff but

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,919
imagine that like one person could get

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
like it's kind of like startup i guess

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,760
in a sense like

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
got millions of dollars and terraria has

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,519
a small team

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,479
most recently baba's you which i believe

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,000
was made by

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,560
one person as well or like had some

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
collaborators but these are all games

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
that have

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
millions of either users or sold

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
millions of copies

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
and they could be made by a small group

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,360
and that is

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,279
totally possible in gaming not easy

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,040
but possible so this is the route that

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,519
myself

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
because i'm like i don't have millions

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,480
this is the route that i

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,800
took and there are some other indies

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,519
that are kind of in the gray area where

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
um like for example the developers of

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
pub g they started out

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
they definitely had a smaller team

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,399
starting out than most

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,680
aaa um and people called them an indie

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
studio like

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
in their kind of beginning i don't know

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
if people are still calling them indie

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,920
given that they have had massive success

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
um but they do have a larger budget and

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,640
can make uh kind of games and more

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,959
scales so

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
indie can be kind of an ambiguous term

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,240
depending on

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,080
what you're looking at like team size or

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
budget or reach

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,519
um but yeah i just wanted to mention

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,240
that this is also a potential way

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,080
one can make games and there's many

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,120
roles in game development

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,440
so i did want to point this out because

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
as a small developer you need to do more

00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
of these roles

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
and if you're working in a triple a

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
studio you don't need to you can do your

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,800
own thing

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,760
that's kind of why i want to mention it

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,959
um it takes

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,279
a team to build a game um or

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,240
if you're a team of one you have to do

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
all these rules

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
so of course there's narrative design

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,920
and writing which is

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
actually kind of overlooked when people

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,680
are considering

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,600
programming um as the main route into

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,480
gaming i mean maybe in my bubble

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
yes um but i find that narrative design

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
is such a core

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,480
part of creating a game like when you're

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,200
a pokemon and you're like you know

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,560
battling against the gym trainers or you

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,959
have like

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,720
you're meeting an npc and they're

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,200
talking to you like someone wrote that

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,760
that is narrative design and writing

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
um of course you have the game

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,640
programmers and the engine

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,160
or physics developer um this is more

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,200
likely a dedicated rowing

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,800
role in aaa you would have producer and

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
project coordinator so the producer is

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,519
kind of like the director in a movie or

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
i guess like in tech like they would we

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,120
would call these two roles

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,440
um it'd be like product or

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
some sort of like vp of product or

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,279
project manager i don't i don't know

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,640
why they needed to kind of break out

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,399
project coordinator

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
it could be an artifact of any other

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
field like movies i'm not

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,279
familiar but they're they're kind of

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,440
like

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
they have these two roles for those type

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
of

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,160
functionalities which are of course

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,120
important if you're in tech

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,480
and you can kind of extrapolate that to

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,360
why it's important

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,760
in gaming as well because they ensure

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
that

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
the train is running that people are

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,640
doing what they're doing

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,279
um and now we have like art stuff which

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
is

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,600
actually super important um as someone

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
coming from programming i also

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
underestimated this a little bit because

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,760
when you think about it

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
programmers made the game so let's say

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,000
for games like

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,000
super mario kirby pokemon

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,680
it's like i remember the gameplay but i

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
remember the art style

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,440
of the game when people talk about the

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,959
games like pokemon

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
they're thinking about like there's like

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,959
a huge visual element to it

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,720
right so i think these roles are

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,200
extremely important

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,519
as well so i wanted to give that

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
overview just so that the next portion

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
and like the

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,440
things that i have made with renpi and

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,639
the game that i shipped kind of makes

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
more sense

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,240
in the context of the broader kind of

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
gaming so

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,720
vampire i i used renpi as an indie

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,839
developer so basically as a one

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,920
woman team and with some contractors

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
so that's why i needed to introduce

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,320
those things first

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,600
so next i'll be talking about narrative

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
games or

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
visual novels so it's kind of like a

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,639
genre or a medium

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,399
of game that focuses more on let's say

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,880
dialogue driven

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
and character driven storytelling so it

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,519
can be done in many ways i want to bring

00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
up a more

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,040
commonly known example which is the

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
netflix

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,720
series black mirror they had a movie

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
where

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,959
at different points in the movie you

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,240
could make choices so you could say do i

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,880
accept this offer or not

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
do i do something else like do something

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,480
rash or do i like

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
run away or something like that and

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
depending on what you do

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
it kind of like branches out and like

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,120
there's different

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
types of scenarios that play in the

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,720
movie after and it affects your outcome

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
of the movie and this is definitely one

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
type of

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,160
narrative driven experience and you can

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,120
see how like this interaction

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,639
um is not only being done in movies of

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
course because like it's actually

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,800
not commonly done in movies but it's

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,079
just very common in games

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,880
so i wanted to bring up that example um

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,320
there was also this like older series

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
that was pretty successful and

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,480
well-known

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,120
um it's called the no-nary games and uh

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
one of the

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
games and is called 999. so basically

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
it's a

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,079
murder kind of murder mystery escape

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,680
room

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,279
type of uh game where you have to

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,600
learn about all the other characters

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,160
there's like ten of them or something

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
actually i forget like nine oh yeah the

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,079
nine

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,920
or something um uh and then you talk

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
to them and you find out their motives

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
and stuff like that and there's also

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,040
puzzles

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
in the game um as well but you can see

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,120
that a lot of the dialogue

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,760
is kind of delivered with this like text

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,760
box type of situation

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,920
at the bottom and this is very common

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
for a lot of very successful games

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,959
recently as well

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,199
so for example persona 5 is a pretty

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,040
uh really well selling game as of late

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,440
actually when i made the slides maybe

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,760
but um it's not like extremely new but

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,959
it's

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,000
recent um you can see that they have

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,399
like the 3d

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
elements and like some other like battle

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,000
elements that happen in 3d in the

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
background but like the main

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,560
kind of character-driven narrative

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,120
is like this visual novel style like 2d

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,959
in the front with this dialog box um and

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
that's how the meat of the story is

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,000
getting delivered so

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,399
it's called like visual novel style um

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
another series called denganropa and

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,320
they've been

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,120
they've sold very well both in japan and

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
overseas and they also have this kind of

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
like

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,360
psychological horror uh type of

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,360
situation

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,399
and uh it's like in a dialogue box where

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
you get to

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
talk to the other characters and get to

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,880
find out all their secrets and stuff

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
like that

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,120
and yeah that's a very

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,480
very popular way of narrative delivery

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
and when you think about like pokemon

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
games too like they have a dialog box at

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,360
the bottom so

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
that's kind of like a main way of

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,240
delivering um

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,600
narrative in the game so uh

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,639
with that genre of games kind of like

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,279
more solidified hopefully in your

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,959
your mind and that you know it's very

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,000
clear that you're not making a first

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,959
person shooter

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,720
like open world rpg or something like

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,279
that but rather it's like more this like

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
2d

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,720
like narrative style game this is the

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
type of game that i wanted to make as an

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
indie developer

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,079
of course some of the games i mentioned

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,040
before that were really successful

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,560
they had more developers so they had

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
custom engines when i was doing my

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,120
research on like how did they make these

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,160
games

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,360
um as a larger studio

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,240
yeah plenty of custom engines made

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,279
um and plenty of successful games made

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
with them

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,959
but as an indie developer custom engines

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
are

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,040
costly i don't have really so much time

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
to be

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
doing these things when i have to figure

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
out all the other stuff like

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,560
writing my 70 000 words story script

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,759
um so right now i'm going to be

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,440
uh talking about renpon which is what

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,640
enabled me i'm sorry i'm just

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,959
plugging in my computer um yeah

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,439
reply open source python based game

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,280
engine which you can use to make games

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,799
like the ones that i mentioned earlier

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,199
in that section

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,880
um and that i made which is what a

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,000
summer with the shiba inu

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,959
is it's a narrative driven visual novel

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,280
game

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:30,480
and because i already had

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,360
python knowledge i started making games

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,480
before i entered my full-time job in

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,200
machine learning but just like the fact

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
that i could

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,559
translate the tools that i was using

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,679
between these two was really beneficial

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
for me um of course python has great

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,360
documentation

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
as hopefully all of you have had the

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,880
pleasure of knowing

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,520
um and it's object oriented oriented

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
programming which is very commonly used

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,440
in

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
game dev anyway so that was really

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,280
useful and like

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,320
transferable in terms of designing the

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,919
games in in

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,400
like coding um so yeah

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
it can be high production quality as

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,440
well

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,440
um the games made in renpi can range

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
from those made in nano renault which is

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
like this yearly

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
like half hackathon kind of sprint thing

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,200
where people make

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,480
a game in a very short period of time

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,039
with renpi

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,840
um or well it doesn't have to be renfi

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
but just like

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,640
very commonly it is um or high budget

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,280
games which is um

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
like a lot of the games that i will

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
mention

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,160
uh in the subsequent section and kind of

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
demonstrate as well

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,360
there were a lot of games that i really

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
enjoyed that were made

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
in rinpai and they were really high

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,440
production quality

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
so i think the creator's philosophy

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,919
which is

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
he said he wanted to make the best way

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
to make visual novels and give it away

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,919
for free

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,720
i think that is true it was the case for

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,160
me

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,880
and as i mentioned before object

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,280
oriented programming is pretty standard

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
in

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,200
game dev like unreal uses c plus plus

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,880
um unity engine uses c sharp it's not

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,360
the languages that makes

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,080
this paradigm transferable between like

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,320
these

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
kind of design across engines but it's

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,520
just like

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
the way you think about things like oh a

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,760
character class

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,880
oh like a menu class oh a ui like this

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
piece of the ui

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,320
class where like that is transferable

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,840
across

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,360
all of those engines not not just

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,320
because of like the languages or

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,919
whatever

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:43,120
um but yeah just in in terms of gaming

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,240
this just is possible to do in python if

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,520
you have that way of

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,799
thinking um so now i want to mention

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,400
some of the things i like

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,760
about grandpa i think it's pretty

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,160
flexible you can do screen customization

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,000
quite easily like the ui and stuff like

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,120
that and it actually has a lecture

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,679
in the back um behind the scenes so you

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,000
can write like a non-program

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,880
mr friendly syntax like you can see in

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
this screenshot

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,039
it has scene screen gallery so

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
it's like instantiating a classic screen

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,919
that's called

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,520
gallery if i recall correctly something

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,679
like that it like parses it in the back

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
so you know for beginners it's also

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,480
pretty

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,760
easy to use um one of the most popular

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,760
games called made in venpai called doki

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,360
doki literature club it has millions of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,600
downloads

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,200
it has like these visual effects that

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,080
you can totally do

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,559
um just an example to show that it's not

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,799
just

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,400
static 2d images but you can make a lot

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,039
of animations

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,960
as well in this next example you can see

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,080
that you can make this kind of like

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,760
um kind of whirlpool animation but this

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,960
is a very simple like

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,440
with the same concept kind of like

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,360
you can make like thunder you can make

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,480
like snowing you can make

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,120
just like a ton of animations with very

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
simple

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,919
um kind of just like lines of code

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,440
because they have this so for example in

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,120
this case there's an image dissolved

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,440
class in the engine

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,919
and all you need is like a transparent

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,679
uh kind of partially transparent image

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,520
and it'll kind of create this like

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,679
effect and of course you can just like

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,159
add that all up to do whatever you want

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,880
um not just like this one effect but

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,200
um if you want to do other things it's

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,000
pretty flexible so i changed it to the

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
pycon

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,120
us logo as you can see um i

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,120
actually did this live in the python

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,159
canada talk and i just like

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,840
opened up the engine um during the

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,320
presentation and thankfully

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,280
uh murphy's law in live coding didn't

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,880
happen and

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,880
nothing crashed um next

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
you can actually make pretty complicated

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,000
strategy games that are

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,320
like in 2d rather than 3d

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,760
uh one of these games is called long

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,720
live the queen which is a pretty

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,799
successful

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
strategy game in the english visual

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,000
novel

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,240
uh genre and it has

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,480
it's able to handle so many variables

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,640
that it blows my mind like people write

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,919
extremely detailed guides on like the

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
player interaction

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,000
and like all the scenarios that can

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,000
happen um you can make

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,679
that kind of game in grandpa and this

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
game was made with that too you can

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,960
there's like tons of different

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,320
ways of player interaction and fun like

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,240
there's tons of ways you can die in the

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,280
game as well which is

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,240
nice um i'm gonna show this other thing

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,280
which is a

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,039
3d camera plug-in whoops

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,440
um let's see okay

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,520
here we go uh you can see that you can

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,159
kind of bring the camera

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,559
in back and forth a little bit and do

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,760
like tilting as well so it kind of like

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,840
mimics a bit of the 3d effect uh

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,360
if you want to and you can do very

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,520
complicated

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,679
um scene design in this case and i've

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
started to play around with this for my

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,159
upcoming

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,400
game as well and uh it's pretty flexible

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,320
with the ui you can have all types of

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,360
art styles

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,159
you just have to write your little

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,360
dialog box class and you know make it

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,400
how you want it and off you go

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,960
um i'm going to show my example of a

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,320
timer class which is when the player

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,520
makes a choice or

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,039
interaction in the game it'll tell you

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,039
how long it took and this is just

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,400
really very familiar python to you all

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,120
import random import time

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,320
right like everyone who has used python

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,679
probably knows

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,840
is familiar with this and just start

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
writing my class and this is how i could

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,200
get the idea of hey i'll just have a

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
timer and

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
get it from my brain to python to the

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,240
game

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,919
thanks to rempey and

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,360
it is flexible too like you can see the

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,640
kind of you can use decorators you can

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,440
do a lot of very common stuff in python

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,640
and

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,039
this is one thing that i made that

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,799
picks a random utterance from a few of

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,440
them so if you think of

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,000
uh if a game npc keeps saying hello

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,919
hello

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,039
hello it's kind of boring right so i

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,279
wanted to

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,720
have it pick something random like oh

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,480
interesting hmm

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,080
like differently depending on the

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,000
scenario so

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,559
this is also doable because i know

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,640
python so this is just a screenshot of

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,279
those two combined together like it said

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,799
whoa uh it picked like randomly from the

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,159
utterances

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,200
and uh that is the function well the the

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720
feature that i made

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,120
and that was possible with rand pi um

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
so yeah you could actually easily remake

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,720
the netflix movie i mentioned band or

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,080
snap which is like the interactive movie

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,440
in renpi

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,240
um and it actually used twine which is a

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,360
popular

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,240
tool in the vn community to code

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,520
the script as well so that was really

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
interesting to me because

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,520
grandpa can actually make a lot of games

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,880
that are much more complicated

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,400
um than constrained to with a movie i

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,919
suppose

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,200
and yeah if you want to achieve a lot of

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,600
the things

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,360
in a lot of the visual novel games i

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,679
mentioned you can use rempah

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,880
and make really high production quality

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,480
games

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,120
so yeah i want to say you can try venpai

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,000
it's pretty friendly to newcomers you

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,600
can use

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,559
just python you can take a look at the

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,240
non-programmer-friendly language to

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,320
instantiate stuff

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,000
uh it's flexible for seasoned devs

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,600
because you can just like dig into all

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,440
the source code really

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,760
uh it's on github benpai reply

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,360
and thank you renpiton the creator i

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,520
think your vision did come true

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,520
this is a work in progress of card

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,440
selector screen that was also possible

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,760
just because i was thinking of it

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,880
just like translate it to python and off

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,240
i go

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,600
i've actually improved um this

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,720
scene since i captured this gif but

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,880
you know i just wanted to show that

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,960
so feel free to check out the game this

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,840
summer with the shiba inu

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
it's on all the platforms on consoles

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,360
and pc

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,360
and now feel free to go make your own

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,400
story driven game

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,720
in rempey so yeah thank you for
