hello my name is cerania bark and today

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,040
i'm going to tell you about what i

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
learned from

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,400
six years of building community

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,599
so before dev code newbie was acquired

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,680
by dev

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,600
we did a bunch of things we did twitter

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
chats podcasts meetups

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,439
and our annual conference call codelands

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,920
all by ourselves

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,920
my coding journey was started many many

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
years ago and about seven to eight years

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
ago

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
and during my coding journey i started

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
in the world of startups

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
i had tons of experience doing things

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,920
like business development and marketing

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,160
and sales

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,559
but it was all on the non-technical side

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,640
the non-engineering side of startups

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,559
and i love this world i love this idea

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
of building something from nothing

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
starting from scratch and being able to

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
create these new experiences and

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,480
products for different people

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,520
but what i realized was that who i

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
really wanted to be

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
wasn't this business development

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,600
marketing person who i wanted to be

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
was hacker woman i wanted to be the

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
person behind the actual product the

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,880
person who was building the person who

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,600
was creating the thing

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,439
that other people got to use and so i

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
looked at that and i said man i really

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,400
want to get

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,240
into the technical side of things and so

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640
i decided to learn how to code

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,560
i left my job at my startup and decided

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,439
to spend about three months learning on

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
my own

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,119
and then applied and got accepted into a

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,159
boot camp for another few months

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,680
and started my journey as a developer

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
i worked as a developer for a couple

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
years but really

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
what happened that kind of kick-started

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
my code newbie journey

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
wasn't just coding it was my twitter

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
journey

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
so my twitter journey started because i

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
looked around at the people

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
in my boot camp and i looked around at

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,000
our collective experience and i said to

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
myself

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
you know the education is great our

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,640
professor our teacher is amazing

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,799
but the real value in doing this boot

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,719
camp isn't just the education

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
it's the people it's having that

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
community of people to look to look up

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,640
to to get support from

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
to really grow with and having that

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
community meant

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
everything it was the big difference

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,520
between learning on your own which is

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,560
very sad and lonely and frustrating a

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
lot of the times

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
to being around people who also felt

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
frustrated and also got upset and

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
also felt stupid a lot of the times they

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,239
were learning how to code

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,440
and having those mutual feelings and

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
sharing that experience

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,840
really changed the entire game and made

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,640
it feel a lot more doable a lot more

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,319
feasible

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,239
and so i said to myself i want to give

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,400
other people an opportunity

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560
to find their people and to find their

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
community even if they're not in a boot

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
camp

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,319
because the boot camp was pretty

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
expensive at the time it was about

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
eleven

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
twelve thousand dollars these days it's

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,560
20 25

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
000 and i said to myself how do i bring

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,120
people together

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,239
who don't know that they can

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
leverage each other and their

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,040
relationships and their connections in

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
order to be

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
really great developers how do i bring

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,040
that community together

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
and so i started a twitter chat and a

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,319
twitter chat is when we meet every

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
wednesday evening at 9 00 pm that was

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,840
our designated day and time

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
and for one hour i would tweet out

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,360
questions and the questions would be

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
things like what are you excited about

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
what are you learning and where do you

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,920
need help and

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,080
every week people would come on and talk

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,920
and connect and in responding to my

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,000
questions really what they were doing

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
was they were talking to each other and

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,879
we started off every twitter chat

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,319
exactly the same way

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
we started with we are the most

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
supportive community of programmers and

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
people learning how to code

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
and we kicked off the chat with our

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
three rules be supportive be honest be

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,599
nice

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
and this really set the tone for the

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,640
expectations of the chat and the real

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
value that you were getting

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
once you join this chat you are going to

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
be with us and you're going to create

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
this dynamic dialogue and conversation

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
and really help each other out

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
those were the expectations and so we

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
did this chat

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
and eventually our community began to

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,439
grow we began to get bigger and bigger

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,680
and here is a lovely wall of people

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
saying really nice things about how much

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
they're enjoying the chat

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,400
now as a community builder i learned a

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,480
few things

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,959
i learned that it is really important

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,599
that people feel safe and feel loved

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,599
people need that feeling especially when

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
it comes to entering a community

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
and being a part of something that's

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,560
bigger than themselves this feeling of

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,400
safety and love is absolutely essential

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
the second thing i learned is that it's

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,240
not really about a place

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,080
it's about a shared experience i see a

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
lot of people start communities by

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,040
creating a slack channel or creating

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
a twitter account and not really

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,919
thinking about the experience that

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
people are going through

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,400
because it's not that we literally had a

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
twitter account or had a slack community

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,160
or these days

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,240
have a community on forum is the fact

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,000
that we had the shared experience

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,320
and our shared experience was the

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,320
twitter chat our shared experience was

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,040
going through these conversations

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,800
on a weekly basis for one hour and using

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
that as the thing that connected us that

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
brought us together and from that shared

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,800
experience is where we're able to build

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
our relationship next is the rules on

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
recruiting and filtering

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,960
it is really really important that we

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,960
had those three rules that i mentioned

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,880
a little bit earlier those rules were

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
essential to recruit and to filter

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,720
they did one thing in terms of

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,600
recruiting which is that they said hey

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,199
if you are this type of nice helpful

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
supportive person

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,560
you want to hang out with us we want you

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
here so it's recruiting people and

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,080
calling people

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,720
to us and attracting them to what we are

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
doing

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
but the second thing it did was it

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,160
filtered people out if you are

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,199
not a loving kind mushy gushy emotional

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
kind of person

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,080
we're going to annoy the crap out of you

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
you're not going to want to hang out

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
with us

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
and so by being kind of over the top

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,440
loving and over the top supportive and

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
over the top full of good fields and

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
positive vibes

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
we kind of set ourselves up to be a turn

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
off for people

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
who aren't really that type of that type

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,720
of personality and that type of

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,639
predisposition

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,919
so in that way those rules really help

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,520
us recruit and filter

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,680
and kind of keep our community nice and

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
strong but it's not just as a community

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
builder where i learn things

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
i also learn things as a developer as a

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
developer i learn

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
the people are generally helpful and

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,919
it's up to you to ask for help

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,520
this came through when we're building

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,360
parts of the code to the app

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,280
this came through we're asking for help

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
with code movie on the technical side

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
and the non-technical side but it was

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
such a refreshing

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,880
thing to learn that people really are

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
eager to help you and eager to support

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,199
you

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,880
you just have to ask them and they're

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
really on standby ready to

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,319
to do something on your behalf if they

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
feel like they believe in your mission

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
and luckily

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
we had a mission that people really

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
believed it

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
the fifth thing is the power of twitter

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,919
mentorship this has been an

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
absolutely incredible phenomenon to

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
watch and if you're active in tech

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
twitter

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,360
then this is probably something that is

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,479
familiar to you but it is amazing how

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
people will say you know hey i'm

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
struggling with something i'm having a

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
hard time

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
i don't know how to do this interview i

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
don't know how to do this problem and

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
twitter will

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,599
be there ready to mentor and when we

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
think of mentorship we think of this

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
long deep relationship where you've

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
known that person for

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,680
years you meet on a weekly monthly basis

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,759
you have coffee you talk about your

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,800
hopes and dreams this is a very intimate

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
relationship

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
and that's kind of hard to come by it's

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
hard to find people like that that you

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,160
also

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,479
mesh with and connect with and so with

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
this twitter mentorship idea

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
you don't need that level of depth but

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,520
you can still get a lot of value

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,360
you get a lot of value from just

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,199
tweeting hey i'm having a hard time

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
someone slides in your dms and says hey

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
you know i saw your tweet what do you

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,039
need help with

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
um or vice versa are you reaching out to

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
someone else through their dms and

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
saying hey

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
i'm having a hard time can you help me

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
and them saying you know what do you

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
need

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,720
so this idea of this quick twitter

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,440
mentorship has been a really great

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
phenomenon to watch

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,360
so i noticed that some topics were a

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
little too big for twitter we did these

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,160
chats for about six months

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,319
and there were some things that just

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,360
didn't quite fit the twitter chat

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,520
um experience and didn't didn't

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,440
fit the twitter chat mold and so i said

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,039
to myself what is a better way

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,720
to have some of these deeper more

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280
complex conversations

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,879
and that started my my podcast journey

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,800
my code interview podcast journey

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
so we launched a show called the code

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,599
newbie podcast

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,680
and it's one of my favorite things that

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,199
i've ever done and we launched a show

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
almost every week for

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
uh six seven years we've done hundreds

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
of podcast episodes

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,479
and this was our opportunity to

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
interview people and really dig into

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,080
their story to dig into

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,319
how they became developers what they're

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
working on to introduce new technical

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,680
topics to

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,039
our community of developers and to

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
really make sure to

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,640
to open the perspectives and experiences

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,680
of people who are breaking into

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
technology

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,279
now as a community builder i learned

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,560
that stories are

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,600
everything people love stories more than

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
education

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
more than learning more than expertise

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
people really want to hear

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
a good story and having people say oh my

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,920
goodness i could totally relate to that

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,160
you know babysitter who you know was

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
working on weekends and learning how to

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,040
code at night

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
and eventually you know broke into tech

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
i can really relate to her journey

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
uh being able to say you know that truck

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
driver is one of our one of our

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,920
favorites

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,160
our story of um a man a father i believe

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,320
who was driving trucks for for over a

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,920
decade and slowly but surely learned how

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,760
to code and eventually became

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,440
a developer himself these are all

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
stories that people get excited about

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,320
and love hearing from

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,760
they're an opportunity for people to

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
connect to each other

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,000
and for people to get inspired by things

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,399
that maybe they can do as well

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
related to that is that representation

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,600
matters

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
we're very intentional about who we uh

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
who we talk about and who we bring onto

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,920
the show

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
and we work really hard to make sure

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,480
that our our lineup is very diverse

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
very inclusive we're inclusive of people

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
from different backgrounds

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,360
ethnicities genders parts of the world

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
we try to really

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
diversify our lineup and this is very

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
intentional

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,680
it's because we really believe that

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
representation matters we believe that

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,519
it is

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,000
much much easier to achieve a dream

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,320
to achieve a goal if you're able to look

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,480
at someone like you and say oh wow

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
if they did it i can do it too that is

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
such a powerful notion

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,640
and so we want to give people as many

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
opportunities to relate to our guests as

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
possible we want to show

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
all the different ways you can become a

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
developer and

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
make people feel like they are being

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
represented in the stories that we bring

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,800
to them

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
and as a host what i learned is i need

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
to get out of the way that is my primary

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
responsibility

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
although it is my show and i am the host

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
and i make

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,680
uh the final decisions on things at the

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
end of the day it's just not about me

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,760
it's really all about the guest and it's

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,160
my job to make the guests feel

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,680
like they are the true star of the show

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
and just to illustrate what i mean by

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
this

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,120
here is a graphic of one of our episodes

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,240
this is uh season five episode eight

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,920
many seasons ago and this is uh our

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,079
track for both myself

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,160
and for our guest chad fowler as you can

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,880
see i am that top

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,519
row in the green and he is the bottom

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
blue

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,560
and as you can see chad talks a lot more

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
than i do

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
i don't really say that much and you can

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,000
see that from the sound waves that

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,519
that fill up the the row and so you can

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
see there that i'm really doing my best

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
to kind of step back and make sure that

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
chad gets uh

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
gets his space and gets up gets his

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
opportunity to shine

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,839
same thing with scott hanselman which is

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,519
episode 17 is a very very early episode

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,120
i'm at the top scott's at the bottom as

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
you can see scott

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
talks a lot more than chad scott's got

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,120
lots of great stories and things to

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,959
share

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,399
and the interesting thing is most of the

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,120
sound waves you see

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,800
on my track aren't even me talking it's

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,160
me going

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,000
and it's really just those sound effects

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
and it's my way of active listening and

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
participating

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,600
and really taking a step back and making

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,680
sure that scott has enough room

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
to do his thing now as a developer what

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,560
i learned

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
is that there's truly no one way to do

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,240
it this is my favorite part

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
of hearing these developer stories

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
people have gotten into tech in a

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,440
wide wide range of things as a developer

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
this is such a reassuring thing to to

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
listen to and to hear

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,399
ultimately there is no one way to be a

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,360
developer and there is no one way to

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
build a product

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,399
there are many different ways there are

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
many different avenues there's many

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
different things

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,279
you can try and break and fix and

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,040
ultimately there are

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,440
general best practices there's probably

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,360
a set of ways of things that you should

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,560
not do and things you can avoid

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,000
but ultimately the the main goal uh the

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
main thing that we're trying to do is

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
just get to that finish line

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
and end up being really strong

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
developers and there is

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,440
an endless number of ways to do that and

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
these shows this podcast is really a

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
great reminder

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,440
of the different avenues we can take

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
the number 10 thing is that junior

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
developers are assets

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,440
this is one of my favorite things of

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
doing these interviews is for

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
more senior people ask them you know

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,160
what's it like to work with the juniors

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
on your team what is that experience

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
been like

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
and over and over again i hear that

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,720
working with junior members

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is great it's an asset juniors offer a

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
fresh perspective

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
juniors ask a lot of really great

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,079
questions juniors are

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
really great people to see things from a

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,160
different perspective

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
and to really uh bring in a new a new

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,360
edge a new twist

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
on the way things are doing and the way

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
things are happening

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,760
they challenge the status quo because

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,560
they don't have

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
you know ingrained um you know their own

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,360
way of doing things

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
yet so they're able to learn very

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
quickly and be more malleable

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,079
and they're able to very comfortably go

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,959
wait a minute why are we doing this

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,600
because it comes

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,639
from a place of sheer curiosity and

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
trying to understand

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,160
it helps kind of challenge you and make

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,199
sure that you know what you're talking

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
about what you're doing

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,040
so juniors are a great addition to the

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,920
team and it's been wonderful just

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
hearing uh

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,519
more senior developers call that out and

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,199
support our early

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,519
early career developers number 11 is

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,240
that consistency is powerful

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,880
it is so important to just continuously

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,320
show

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,079
up for us that means that we uh you know

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
do the podcast on a regular basis we

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,480
used to do it every week

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,160
now we do it um in season so we do every

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
week for eight weeks and we take a month

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
off and we go back

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
eight weeks take a month off but

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,760
consistency is really powerful and this

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
shows up in developing too

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,600
it is really important that you keep

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
coding uh one of the things that we hear

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
is people say you know

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,880
i go on and off and i start and then i

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,399
stop and people ultimately

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
need to just keep being really

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,560
consistent and keep going

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
in their coding and that consistency is

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
really important

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
so we've been doing the podcast things

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
are going great we're having a great

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
time

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,880
and then i get an email from a company

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
and this email says hey

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
i'll pay you 200 bucks if you run an ad

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
on your show

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
and i said to myself holy crap i can

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,440
make money from this

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,639
and so i decided to take my podcast

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,320
and transform it into an entrepreneurial

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,800
journey and that's what we will talk

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,519
about next so as an entrepreneur with

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
co-newbie

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,360
i ended up building a business that was

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,839
based on sponsorships and advertising

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
and so

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,040
everything except for our conference was

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,040
free to

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,240
uh to our community then of course we

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
charged a ticket price for our

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
conference

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,240
uh which was still very inexpensive very

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
very low cost compared to other

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
conferences

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,360
and everything else we did we did for

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,040
free with the support of our sponsors

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
and advertisers

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,720
and so in that entrepreneurial journey i

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
learned a few things as a community

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,519
builder

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
i learned that it is very important to

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,199
capture the value you create

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
i've talked to many community builders

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,560
who put out

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
a lot of really great work and don't

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
make any money from it and aren't able

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,199
to sustain themselves

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
and what happens inevitably is they burn

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,560
out they burn out they cut back on the

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
activities they're doing or they stop

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,199
all together

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,639
they're not able to fully fulfill their

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,040
mission of supporting

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,880
their community as much as they want to

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,399
and ultimately i understand that not

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
everyone can turn their thing into a

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
business

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
but i think that finding those

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,399
opportunities to capture that value

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
and being really open to that and really

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
intentional about that

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
is really important to the

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,519
sustainability of what you're doing

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,519
and as a developer i learn the

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,040
sustainability is very important

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,440
uh as as a code newbie founder

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,040
um it really is talking about that money

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,959
aspect that financial aspect

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,360
but in terms of coding we're also

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,120
talking about this idea of you know open

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,920
source of collaboration

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,839
of giving yourself to your community and

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,040
making sure to do your best

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,199
in um and in bringing them what it is

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,920
that they need to be better developers

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,720
and so for that that means us being able

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,519
to

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,680
do our work consistently do it well and

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,360
do it over a long period of time

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,360
and that sustainability especially comes

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
into play when we talk about open source

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,399
and how a lot of open source you know

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,040
contributors

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,959
really burn out and they really do you

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
know just just hit a wall after

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,199
so much of giving and giving and giving

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,000
so being able to go at a steady pace

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,040
being able to manage your own health and

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
your own energy

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,480
is really really important both in

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,799
community building and also

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,000
in building a product so things were

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,520
going really well

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,240
and then we decided to introduce a

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,760
second show called the base cs podcast

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
and this show was all about teaching

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,919
computer science so we talked computer

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,160
science in little bite size chunks

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
of 20 minutes each and i did this with

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,439
my co-host vada hijoshi who wrote the

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,799
blog series called

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,839
basis blog series and so in doing this

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,280
podcast uh what we learned was something

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,120
about accessibility

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,039
so we got this really nice email from a

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
listener who said thank you so much for

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,440
listening

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,520
for you know putting together the show

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
it's been a huge value add

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,320
to myself and uh you know it's been

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,360
really powerful for me because

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,880
i'm blind and i can't use a lot of the

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,280
computer science material

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
out there because i can't see and a lot

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,480
of it is very visual

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,320
and it was really great to hear a

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
resource literally hear a resource

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,000
that i could use and i thought about

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
that and i said whoa

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,160
i never thought of it that way i create

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,000
a podcast because i i like audio and i

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
think audio is a really great medium for

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
this type of content

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,280
but i really wasn't thinking about it in

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,880
terms of an accessibility standpoint

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,559
and that's what brought me to our 14th

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,760
lesson which is that accessibility is

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,720
everywhere even when you're not

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,640
expecting it

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
every time you draw something every time

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,520
you write something every time you put

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
something out in the internet

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,440
there is an accessibility angle to it

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,480
whether you mean there to be or you

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
don't

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,600
there is going to be some group of

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
people who are able to access that

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,400
content

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,840
people who aren't and it's your job to

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,919
think about the people who aren't and

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,080
figure out how to bring them into

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,960
the equation how to bring them into your

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
community

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,480
so it was just a really eye-opening

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,320
experience to think that

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,559
accessibility isn't just about you know

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,960
color contrast or the wacag

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,919
it really is about everything that we do

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,559
period including

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,480
a conference and that brings me to my

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,880
next journey which is my conference

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
organizer journey so we organized the

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
conference called

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
codeland and this conference is one of

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,640
my favorite things

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,520
one of my other favorite things that

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,840
i've ever done and we had a really great

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,640
conver in-person experience before covid

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,000
and then now it is uh it's become remote

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,559
and it was a really great

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
opportunity for us to bring together our

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,080
kodi people from the internet

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,679
and really bring them together in real

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
life to have them

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,120
see each other meet each other get to

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,520
know each other hear talk from each

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
other

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,000
and just build a physical community for

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
uh for our first time i thought it was

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,640
going to be a really powerful way

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,559
to do things now at the end of

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
this this code movie conference this

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,600
codeland conference

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,200
what ended up happening is you know i

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,960
asked people to give me feedback

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,240
and i said hey you know tell me what you

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
like what you don't like what you think

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,039
we should improve

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,720
and i thought the conference went really

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,039
well i was really excited

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
and you know i i get home and i open my

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,960
inbox

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,559
and i get a slew of emails of all the

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,080
things that we've gotten wrong all these

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,039
little things like forgetting

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,200
to put food labels on certain foods uh

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,280
the furniture was too small is one thing

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,480
i heard from uh from uh

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,000
um an attendee water bottles versus you

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
know a jug of water was another

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,039
piece of feedback that i got

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,480
environmental concerns things like that

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,080
and there was just a whole list of

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,200
things that uh i

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,640
saw that i was not ready to that i was

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,360
not expecting because i thought we did a

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
great job

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,880
and a little bit that inbox at first i

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,240
felt a little disappointed i felt

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,080
man like i thought we did really well

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
look at all things we got wrong and then

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
i thought to myself you know i should be

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,919
really grateful i should be really

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,320
grateful

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,600
that people cared enough about what

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,600
we're doing

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,440
to really um tell us how we can do

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,440
better right that shows that people

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,039
really give a crap about what we're

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
doing and our mission

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,320
and there's this one email that i got

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
from a friend of mine who gave a nice

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,280
pretty thorough

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,559
list of feedback and i said to her i

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
said you know thank you so much for your

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,520
email

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,039
very thorough you should go to other

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
conferences and tell them you know give

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,760
them your feedback because your feedback

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,400
was just so good like it was so

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,880
specific and so detailed and she said to

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,120
me

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,880
oh i don't do this for everyone i only

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,880
did this for you because i know

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
you'll do something about it and i

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,919
thought about that and i said

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,280
huh not only do people care enough to

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,840
give me this feedback

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,120
but they also trust that i'll actually

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,200
do something about it

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
i never thought of it that way before so

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,600
as a community builder i learn

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,320
that feedback is love feedback is people

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,919
saying i

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,760
care enough about what you're doing that

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
i want you to do it even better

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,520
that i want it to be even more amazing

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
even more magnificent

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,120
and i see potential in doing this an

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
even better way

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,640
and living up to its full potential and

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
i would like to help you get there

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,919
that's really what feedback is all about

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,600
and when you look at feedback through

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,159
this lens all of a sudden

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,799
it hurts a lot less and it becomes a lot

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,679
more

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,039
easy to take in and to really um you

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,039
know take into yourself

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
and act on so feedback is definitely

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,039
love

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
the 16 thing is that small consistent

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,919
acts build trust

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,679
one thing that really made me think

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
about that last email where she said you

00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
know i

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
i sent the sheet because i know you'll

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,159
do something about it is i wonder to

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
myself

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
well how do you know that what have i

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,679
what have i done how do you know

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,960
that i'm going to be the person to take

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
these little bits of

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
bits of feedback and do something about

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,159
it where

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,919
what is the proof of that and i thought

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,840
through my experience

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,440
just with code movie and how i've you

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,480
know worked as a founder

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,400
and how i have um managed myself as

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
a creator of the of the company and i

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
said to myself you know it

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
really isn't in anything grand it's

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,159
really in these small little acts

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
it's in showing up every wednesday for

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,760
the twitter chats it's in emailing um

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,679
hopefully quickly

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,080
and responding to people's questions and

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,360
concerns it's responding to people's dms

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,679
it's getting on the

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
countless phone calls i've gotten on uh

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
in the in the

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
in the last years um talking to people

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,320
who are new to

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,440
coding new to development who just want

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
a little bit of help a little bit of

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,480
advice

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,559
it's in all these different little acts

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,200
that have built trust and confidence

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,320
over the years and it's really this long

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,159
track record

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,960
of little things that have added up to

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,880
the sense of trust overall

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
as a developer i learned that

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,760
application is much

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
more important than tooling this comes

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,520
in to our conference

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,559
talks our talks were very much geared

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,840
towards

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,600
the why and the how versus the what

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
and so instead of talking about you know

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,840
this is what this framework is

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,280
and does we talk about it in terms of

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,200
this is how this framework

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,640
helps solve a problem and this was

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,320
really important to us it was really

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,400
important for us to showcase

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,440
not what's not just what technology can

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,679
do but

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,520
uh what it can do for you and how it can

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,559
solve a problem and how it can benefit a

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,240
true community

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,919
and this focus on application was

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
something that we saw people really

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,559
gravitated towards

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,360
so the next thing is that everyone is a

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,120
newbie

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,880
this was a saying that did not come for

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,720
me it actually came from our community

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,480
when people would say you know i may be

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,919
a senior developer i may have 10 years

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
under my belt but ultimately

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,840
everyone's a newbie and that is

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,559
certainly true even with our more

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,840
advanced

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,360
topics and our more senior topics uh or

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,480
even our beginner topics there were

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,159
people who

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,840
even if they were senior could benefit

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
from the beginner topics because they

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,960
were beginners

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,559
in that topic and this happened so much

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
there was so much crossover where people

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,720
who

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,480
felt like they were really junior in one

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,840
area found they actually knew a little

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,200
bit more in a different area

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
and people who were really experienced

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,440
in one knew nothing about the other

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,279
and so it really helped us kind of set

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
this culture of

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,960
everyone is new no one knows everything

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,480
and we're all

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,080
learning and relearning and kind of

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,480
starting over and over again

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,400
and a lot of times we're back at the

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,480
beginning whether we like to or not

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,640
and having this mindset is very healthy

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,919
and helps us be open to learning and

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
growing

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
now this next section comes with a bit

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
of a trigger warning we are going to

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,120
talk about some

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,400
mental health um some depression type

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,120
thing so if this isn't

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
uh your jam please feel free to skip the

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,840
next

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,159
minute or two so next we're going to

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,600
talk about my mental health journey now

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,880
my mental health journey was a really

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
really big part of my

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,600
my story not just as a community builder

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
but just as a person as a person in tech

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,360
and my mental health journey began a

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,279
couple years ago when i was feeling

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
really really depressed for for months

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,960
at a time i didn't know what was

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,320
going on i hated everything i was just

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,840
very down i

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
i you know i had a really hard time

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,640
functioning getting out of bed i slept a

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,840
lot

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,600
all those things that you hear about

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,360
when it comes to depression and then i

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,559
would have months of pure

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,760
bliss and i would have an amazing time

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,840
and i would be really productive and

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,760
really energetic and really creative

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
and i kept going back and forth through

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,799
these cycles

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,880
and didn't know kind of what was going

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,880
on and didn't piece together that what i

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,679
had was not actually depression

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,600
it was bipolar and it took about a year

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,400
after my diagnosis to actually say to

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,880
myself

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,880
okay i need to do something about this

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,120
and i lost that one year of mental

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,039
health because i kept saying to myself

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,279
you know you don't need drugs you don't

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,559
need to do anything about this like just

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,799
just eat well

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,320
work out and you know do your best i'm

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,919
sure i'm sure you can manage it

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
and i thought almost as a sign of

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,600
strength that i didn't need drugs and i

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,640
saw it as a sign of

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,400
um preserving who i was

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,080
one of my biggest fears about bipolar

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,919
and taking medication for it was i was

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,039
afraid to confront it i was afraid to

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,559
accept that

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,760
i did indeed need help because if i

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,080
did and if i got on medication and if i

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,080
became a brand new person that i would

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,880
lose myself i would lose this identity

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,559
this person

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
that i've gotten to know all these years

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,159
and i was afraid of finding out

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,720
the things i loved about myself my

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,919
creativity my passion my focus

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,000
wasn't really me it was this disorder

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,480
that was what i was really afraid of and

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,039
so about a year of you know battling

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,559
this and

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,799
you know kind of going on and off being

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,400
depressed being happy going up and down

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,840
i said to myself i can't live like this

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,960
anymore i have panic attacks almost

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,799
every single day

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,400
and i said i can't i just can't do this

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,240
i i need to fix my

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,919
my problem and so i ended up getting on

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,360
medication and it completely

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,559
changed my life so as a human i learned

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,120
drugs are great drugs are awesome

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,279
i am very taking medication has been one

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,520
of the smartest things that i've done

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,360
in my in my life right for both my

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,399
career for my personal health

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,159
my professional journey and i learned

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,080
that you know there's nothing

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,440
shameful about asking for help and

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
there's nothing shameful

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,360
about taking treatment if and you know

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,279
if you need it and if you get something

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,279
that can actually benefit you

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,559
the next thing i learned is that mental

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,960
health is indeed

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,679
self-care when i think about self-care i

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,120
think

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,520
candles and you know bubble baths and

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,039
you know meditation and those things are

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,600
definitely self-care and those totally

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,720
count

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,720
but i think just as valuable is um you

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,600
know not not beating yourself up just as

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
valuable

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
is you know clearing your mind is being

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,399
on you know medication if that's what's

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,000
best for you

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,760
it's going to therapy it's doing all

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,320
these things to really take care

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,000
of your brain of your mental health and

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,960
that is showing yourself

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,080
self-love and self-care as well now what

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,520
i've learned and hopefully what you've

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,559
picked up on is that developers and

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,559
community builders

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,760
really aren't that different whether

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,200
you're building an app or you're

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,159
building a community you're going

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
through the same

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,000
journey of understanding building

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,520
listening and iterating

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,880
you're trying to understand your

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,440
community and you're trying to really

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
get

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,200
what it is that they need and what it is

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,279
they want you're constantly building

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
something new whether it's a podcast an

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,000
app

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,240
a conference whatever it is you're

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,159
creating something new all the time

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,159
you're listening you're going back to

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,720
what you created and you're taking in

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,679
that feedback whether it comes in that

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,399
little you know

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
ask me ask me a question support button

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,200
on your website

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,520
or whether it's just an email or a

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
feedback form that you email people

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
you're always listening and you're

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
trying to get that feedback and see what

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,720
people say

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
and then you iterate you rebuild you fix

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,399
those things you relaunch

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,120
you deploy again you fix those things

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,360
that you

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,200
uh got wrong the first time and you try

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,159
one more time and you keep trying until

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,000
you get it right

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,320
and you go through this feedback loop

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,640
over and over and over again

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,919
no matter what it is you're building and

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,080
all these steps fit

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,159
right into community building and fit

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,760
right into product development as well

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,000
so whether you're building an app or a

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,240
community good work takes time

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,120
and patience it's a lot of iterations

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
it's a lot of

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,399
interviews it's a lot of listening i've

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,399
listened to

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,760
hundreds and thousands of people over

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,039
the years uh

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,520
and i'm still learning what the

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,200
community needs and what uh and what we

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
should be building for them

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
and good work is never done and never

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,640
quite feels like you're finished

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
every time you think you've nailed it

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
you learn something new that happens or

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,559
the world around you changes

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
and the world says you know hey i think

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,600
that uh

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,399
you know this new trend is coming up or

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,159
this new company has popped up or

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,679
this new concern has happened especially

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,120
in the last couple years i'm sure we can

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,000
relate to all that's been happening in

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,200
the world

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,279
and now it's time to regroup to bring on

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,080
a new product a new perspective

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,760
um a new podcast maybe and really speak

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,559
to the needs of the community and the

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,039
audience

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,720
so that's my story hopefully you enjoyed

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,320
it you learned maybe something from it
