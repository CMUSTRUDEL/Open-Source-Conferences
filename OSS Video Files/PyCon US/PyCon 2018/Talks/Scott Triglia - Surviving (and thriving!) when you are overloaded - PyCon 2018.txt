Title: Scott Triglia - Surviving (and thriving!) when you are overloaded - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: Scott Triglia

Taking on leadership roles always includes new demands on your attention and time. Inevitably, your finite work week will conflict with the sheer amount of tasks you have to do. How can we as leaders keep stepping up to new responsibilities while balancing our pre-existing ones?

This talk will focus on strategies for managing a too-large workload without abandoning important tasks or doing a shoddy job. We’ll look at techniques to prioritize what work matters most, identify tasks we should be doing ourselves, and finally delegate the rest to build our team’s skills while reducing our own workload.

session

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,280
today's Scott Scott Trillium is here to

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,320
speak us speak to us about surviving and

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:24,029
thriving when you are overloaded

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:26,670
okay Scott please take it away all right

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,830
thanks everybody for coming out so my

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,539
name Scott trillion if you would like to

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,949
ask me questions on Twitter now or later

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,320
maybe later

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,059
I'm at Scott Trillium and we're going to

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,070
talk today about having way too much

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,460
work to do and what we're gonna do about

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,770
it

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,379
and to get us started here I want to

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,260
tell you a little story it is 90%

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:50,010
accurate and we'll see if you recognize

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,969
any parts of it so when I'm having a

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,120
good day at work

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,949
I look approximately like this right I

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,640
like to lay out on the floor of my

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,010
office

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,809
keep it real casual I have an all beige

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,390
office like a photo studio this is

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,920
normal and you know work on my

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,299
old-school laptop and keep my sleeves

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,479
rolled up just the right blend between

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,010
business and casual but we're not here

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,409
today to talk about me on a good day

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,930
we're here to talk about me when I have

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,820
too much work to do so when the work

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,259
starts to pile up maybe I look at JIRA

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,330
and I realized that I haven't you know

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,990
finished all the tickets recently I get

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,009
a little stressed right I'm starting to

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,920
realize that things aren't going well

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,020
and that calm casual posture turns into

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,920
a permanent hunch in the corner of the

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,840
office staring at my own computer and it

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,810
doesn't always get better right

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,000
sometimes all I'll work hard I'll try

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,649
and knock out that backlog and I'll find

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,689
that in spite of all that effort I'm

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,970
actively going backwards

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,579
somehow the backlog is increasing not

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,850
decreasing and things just aren't

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,740
healthy I can't even look my novelty

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,960
1960s terminal in the eye anymore

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,270
because every time I open it up and I

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,399
look at what I have to do I realize oh

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,380
my god it's getting worse this is

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,170
terrible my stress levels shoot up right

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,099
and it's not just about going to work

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,910
when I come home this problem follows me

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,840
right

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,599
I see the stress when I'm interacting

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,670
with my wife I see the stress when my

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,819
workout regimen goes from pretty

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,220
terrible to completely non-existent and

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,900
it even starts to affect my sleep right

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,959
and I'm great at sleep that's a real red

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,150
flag so this is kind of what we're here

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,250
to talk about today is when we're in

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,010
this spot what can we do about it right

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,250
this path if it doesn't get better if it

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,349
doesn't improve leads to burnout and not

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,870
the pretty kind of Instagram style

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,790
burnout it leads to really ugly burnout

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,549
right this is like Scott's life is in

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,079
complete shambles kind of burnout I come

00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:52,090
into the office people look at me in the

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:53,579
morning and they just say Scott you look

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,220
so tired

00:02:53,579 --> 00:03:00,220
thanks guys so what can we do about it

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,620
um my hope today is that I can kind of

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,150
walk you through some strategies walk

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,610
you through some stuff that's worked for

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,940
me this is not gonna be rocket science

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,709
if you came kind of hoping to hear you

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,190
know the most miraculous ideas from on

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,780
high

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,310
you should not be here this is not that

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,049
kind of talk I want to give you

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,120
practical stuff things you can start

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,730
applying tomorrow realistically and get

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
results from they're gonna be relatively

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,250
few adorable kittens but I hope you'll

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,790
enjoy it nonetheless so let's talk

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,530
through what we're gonna cover I promise

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,200
something realistic and we're gonna hit

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,090
three pretty easy points today we're

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,130
gonna talk first about noticing that

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,109
we're overloaded in the first place

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,299
turns out that this is surprisingly hard

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,579
and how quickly we notice actually makes

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,019
a difference for how bad it gets we're

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,000
going to talk about identifying our

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,500
priorities and figuring out out of the

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,599
whole world of things we could be

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,829
working on and maybe especially out of

00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,840
the worlds of things that we aren't

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,760
working on where should we be putting in

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,500
our limited time and then we're gonna

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,329
talk about all the rest of that stuff

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,180
whatever I decide that I'm doing right

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:06,310
now but I need to not be doing how can I

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,019
kind of give that a good home turns out

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,700
your co-workers don't enjoy it when you

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,470
just drop a bunch of tasks in the corner

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,910
and light them on fire we want to come

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,019
up with something a little bit more

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:20,289
graceful than that so I want to say this

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,030
before we get started a really really

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,800
big assist in this whole problem space

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,500
is having a supportive environment

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,670
no big surprise I've been really lucky

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,400
at Yelp for

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,040
six years now to really feel like if I

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,110
was overloaded I could come to my boss

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,580
or my co-workers and be honest about

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,870
that and they would support me and

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,220
figure out something that was going to

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,830
work for actually making my workload

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,740
realistic instead of whatever mess it

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,620
was right then and the other reality

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,480
here is that as you might notice I don't

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,850
suffer from a lot of sort of systemic

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,280
biases or things that are fighting

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,610
against me when I want support from the

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,020
company now that's a sort of a lucky

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,120
thing in my life and the systemic

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,470
unfairness about the world but I want to

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,790
be honest about this stuff and I don't

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,410
want to pretend that this advice is

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,370
going to be equally easy for all people

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:12,370
to apply so with that said let's jump on

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,500
in and you might be wondering a little

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,420
bit Scott why are you talking about

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,490
noticing being overloaded this seems

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,470
like a little bit of a waste of time I

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,010
know I'm overloaded because my life is

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,450
terrible

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,900
we don't need a whole section on this

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,000
right all I can say in response to that

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,430
is in my own experience this is

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,200
surprisingly hard it doesn't seem like

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,780
something that should be that bad but

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,880
the reality is I only noticed the fact

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,160
that I'm sort of snowed in under tasks

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,680
when I've made bad choices for like

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,720
weeks at a time and anything I can do to

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,700
notice that more immediately is a good

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,860
thing so forgive me the slightly

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,830
redundant section and we'll go through

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,190
it one of the things that makes it

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,470
really easy to just sort of not realize

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,660
that you're overloaded are things like

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,120
impostor syndrome right we're very good

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,210
for better or more likely for worse at

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,650
blaming ourselves for any deficiency in

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,810
terms of how much we're getting done so

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,360
you might look at your backlog and say

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,220
you know what I'm behind

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,930
I'm not successfully doing all this work

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,240
but it's only because I'm so bad at my

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,100
job and if only I were better if only I

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,370
used the right text editor surely all

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,470
these problems would go away right the

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,840
kind of nice reality about this problem

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,820
is even and I don't think this is true

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,680
but even if it is true and the problem

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,170
is that your skill set is actually not

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,960
up to the task in some ways that's okay

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,150
right if I have so much work and I'm not

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,190
ready to do that much work and it's not

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,900
the impostor syndrome talking guess what

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,599
I'm still overloaded I still need to do

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,759
something about

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,649
so kind of no matter which way this

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,210
works out you still have a problem to

00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,479
fix so I'd encourage you to not think

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,849
about this um treat it like we treat

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,860
blameless post-mortems right we try to

00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,300
not go around and point at different

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,009
people and say you know what

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,020
you broke the site this week I guess

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,990
we're gonna fire you that's we I think

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,699
we try not to do that when it comes to

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,349
thinking about how you're overloaded try

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,909
and treat it the same way instead of

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,949
saying Scott's terrible at his job and

00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,899
maybe he should work a little harder we

00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,189
want to say how can we make sure that he

00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,839
has the right amount of work for his

00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:20,089
current skill set and his support within

00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:22,789
the company and the reality is is that

00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:24,169
as we try and catch overload there's a

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,749
good reason that we want to catch it as

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,939
early as possible right this kind of

00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:30,169
stuff compounds over time and it's not

00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:32,719
gonna get any better if we don't pay

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,360
attention to it if you think about kind

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,740
of the area under the curve here

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,149
unsurprisingly if you catch it way more

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,219
to the left-hand side of that diagram

00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:41,539
you're in a much better spot and you're

00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:43,849
gonna just have less work to dig

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:45,199
yourself out from underneath and you

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:47,209
really don't want to hit that knee in

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,709
the graph on the right hand side that's

00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,509
when your whole life you know falls

00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,519
apart and you're in a really bad spot so

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,499
we're gonna try and pull our moments

00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,119
that we realize oh I have too much work

00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:59,019
and I need to do something about it all

00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:02,149
the way to the left side of that graph

00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:04,849
so how do we go about this right how do

00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,069
I notice overload in my case and how do

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,779
I make sure that I'm not just cargo cult

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,050
in something that some presenter at

00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:14,509
PyCon told me to do I hope that you can

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,550
all find your own symptoms and realize

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,039
what it feels like honestly very

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,869
viscerally when you have too much work

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,529
to do and sort of build a list of these

00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:25,519
so that you can identify things later on

00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,110
I'm going to talk about a few of mine

00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,699
you may recognize things that are

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,159
relevant to you but I'd encourage you to

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:34,039
think it through on your own as well one

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,630
of mine when the same important item is

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,750
sitting at the top of my to-do list for

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,849
a long time I'll be honest with you a

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,800
certain PyCon talk was sitting at the

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,930
top of my to-do list for a long time and

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,269
I wanted to work on it I knew it was

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,860
important but the reality was I wanted

00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:50,389
to spend time on it right I wanted to

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,420
give it the proper attention it deserved

00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,980
and so it just kind of sat there and I

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,449
started doing all the other stuff and

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,130
is a really common failure mode for me

00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:59,329
personally and I know it's because I

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,399
have too many things on my plate right

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,920
now

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,540
the flip side of that is usually when

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
that important task is sitting up top

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,329
what I'm doing instead is the stuff I'm

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,579
comfortable with my job right now at

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,589
Yelp really focuses on things like

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,899
building roadmaps for teams and

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:20,750
supporting sort of the development of

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,029
other technical leaders and when I get

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,000
sort of overburdened or I'm otherwise

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:28,040
distracted I kind of slide back into the

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,990
stuff I used to do in my old roles so

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,670
maybe I'll start doing some bug fixes

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,740
because I see them or I'll start fixing

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,389
pet peeves and services that I really

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,639
care about but maybe aren't super

00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:40,760
important so I have to keep an eye out

00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,860
for this one but the number one red flag

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,750
for me the thing that always comes up

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,699
and this is how I know that I'm really

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,769
in a bad spot is the amount of time I'm

00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,420
working and this is probably something

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,100
that applies to a lot of us but for me I

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,500
know this is absolutely something to

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,870
look out for so if I'm working late into

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,569
the evenings if I'm working on weekends

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,399
especially and if as I go to bed I'm

00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:02,899
failing to fall asleep normally

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,130
something I'm really good at and it's

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,019
because I'm thinking about something

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,720
over and over in my head those were all

00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,550
red flags so this is my symptom list it

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,769
might not be yours but build one for

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,180
yourself and then the most important

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,490
part is we want to build a regular

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,769
routine around evaluating those symptoms

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,600
so just because you have a really

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,310
excellent list of how it feels when

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,350
you're overloaded if you never look at

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,029
it and this is the default then you're

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,490
gonna not really notice when it applies

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,319
so I do something really simple here I'd

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,389
encourage you to start simple maybe a

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:34,250
weekly check in writing it down in a

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:36,230
text document doesn't have to be fancy

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,120
the point is you just want to try and

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,899
measure it and try and keep track of it

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,389
over a period of time and this is maybe

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,040
where you're thinking there's a problem

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,930
here right some of these things I'm

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,000
proposing are really hard to measure

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,500
accurately and maybe you're getting a

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
sense that like I understand how to

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,839
track ticket velocity in JIRA but how I

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,910
track how much stress I'm under at work

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,490
feels really squishy and I have no idea

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,290
how to write that down I was reading

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,550
people where which is a really excellent

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,410
book and if you haven't heard of it you

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,540
should read it and I came across this

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,000
quote that I'd never seen before and

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,170
instantly really loved and it resonated

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,140
with me

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,850
Gill's law and it says look things are

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,190
hard to measure I'm gonna be honest with

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,170
you but it's always better to try and

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,790
measure them don't run around saying ooh

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,740
that's really tough to measure I'm just

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,180
gonna not that's not an option there's

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,920
always some way you can measure it

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,260
that's better than literally paying no

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,560
attention to it in a structured way so I

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,940
try and apply this to this problem and

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,710
then the reality is you're not gonna

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,150
nail this on the first try you're gonna

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,920
come up with some symptoms that feel

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,570
reasonable you're gonna try them out

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,370
you're gonna see how it goes in

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,900
production and you're gonna iterate from

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,390
there right this is how we do software

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,920
we shouldn't you know treat this as if

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,280
we have to get it perfect the first time

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,510
or else the whole thing's a failure and

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,910
you can have the people around you

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,740
really assist you so your teammates or

00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,820
your colleagues if you trust them and

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,590
feel like this is something you want

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,940
their help on their sort of their

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,860
day-to-day with you and they can help

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,840
notice your boss is hopefully someone

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,490
you can bring this to or if you don't

00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,530
have anybody like this at work maybe you

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,480
take this home with you and you ask your

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:15,200
spouse or another loved one to sort of

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,480
help you keep an eye out so we've built

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,700
this way to detect when we have a

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,680
problem but I haven't yet answered other

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,450
important questions like what on earth

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,300
do we do with it so let's talk about

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,480
that and we're gonna really focus on

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,400
this topic of prioritization as the way

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,620
to attack this problem we're not gonna

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,770
focus on sort of trying to eke out the

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,960
last bit of a sort of efficiency from

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,030
our email workflow we're not gonna try

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,890
and treat this as a problem we can solve

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,050
by configuring them just the right way

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,600
we're gonna say hey we're just doing too

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,640
much maybe we should do a little less

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,770
and we're gonna do that by really just

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,720
asking ourselves look I'm doing a lot of

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,040
stuff right now maybe I can't even tell

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,710
you what I'm working on right now I just

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,730
know it's too much and ask what we

00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:03,020
should be working on instead I'm a

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,910
metaphor person I really like visual

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,650
metaphors in particular so there's a

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,390
podcast called manager tools and they

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,240
talk about sort of the amount of work

00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,620
that I'm doing as a box it's called a

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,810
juggling metaphor but they they use a

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,460
box and this is essentially the finite

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,170
amount of time that I have to spend in a

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,180
week let's call it 40 hours for the sake

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,830
of argument and I fill it up with all

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,160
the tasks that I'm doing right and these

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,870
are differ

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,670
sizes some things are harder than others

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,470
but I fill it up to the brim and that's

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,050
sort of what I'm spending my time on and

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,639
of course the rub comes when somebody

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,709
comes in the door maybe it's my boss or

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,149
my co-workers or my own brain and says

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,860
hey Scott you really ought to do some

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,160
more work right it was a great idea and

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,509
so I have all this extra work what

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,430
should I do with it how do I solve this

00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:46,579
problem

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,439
anybody bigger box wow that would be

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,569
great right I'll just work 50 hours a

00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:52,250
week yeah no I mean what I usually do

00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:54,350
and this is a pretty like careful

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,850
approach is I usually just stack it

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,529
right on top and kind of try and balance

00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,420
the whole thing right make sure I don't

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,300
tip it over it'll be fine I'll totally

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,310
be able to solve this and this looks

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,839
silly in the metaphor and I think that's

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,399
a strength of the metaphor because like

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,250
you can't realistically do this for a

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,439
long time there are a few really basic

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,769
things that come out of this that I

00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:17,449
think are valuable one of them is that

00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:20,120
my ability and time are finite I can't

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,579
build a bigger box maybe if I'm really

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,870
really good at my job I'll eventually

00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,069
shrink how long it takes me to work on

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,709
some of these tasks but to a first

00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:30,680
approximation my time is my time and I

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,139
don't get more of it every week another

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,000
shocking lesson if I'm fully loaded and

00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,189
I want to do something new I should

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,199
probably remove things that I'm

00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:41,089
currently working on again this is a

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,160
really obvious statement but it's

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,790
amazing how rarely we apply this to the

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,589
stuff that we do day to day and not all

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,199
tasks are equally hard or equally

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,910
important some stuff that I've put into

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,730
my box I need to be working on right now

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,240
some stuff is really optional and I need

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,490
to think about which is which so there's

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,079
a variety of ways for us to look at all

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,809
of the work we're doing right now and

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,910
try and figure out sort of roughly what

00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:09,889
are the tasks I'm spending time on if

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,329
you really hate the idea of doing this

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,939
manually you can use something like

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,649
rescue time which is an application you

00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:17,360
install it it'll watch the programs you

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,680
open and how long you spend on them and

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,300
sort of give you a cute report at the

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,009
end of the week saying look Scott you

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,509
spent 40 hours on hacker news I don't

00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:26,029
know why you expect to be able to keep

00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:28,040
up with all your work I don't like doing

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,990
that too much but to each their own if

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,089
you want to do it manually I don't think

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,009
this is too difficult I look at this the

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,470
places I spend a lot of time things like

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,080
a ticket tracker

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,270
more realistically my calendar my

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,590
appointments that I have going or sort

00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,240
of the tool that you use to push code

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,130
and you sort of just roughly get a sense

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,240
of I'm spending eight hours here two

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,440
hours there and so on and the real key

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,200
here is that we're doing a lot of work

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,490
but we want to make sure that we're

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,710
doing the work that's important for our

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,700
own role and if we're doing a bunch of

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,100
work that's important for somebody

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,660
else's role we want to make sure we find

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,930
somebody else that's appropriate to do

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,760
that this here is the Eisenhower matrix

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,560
sometimes called the Eisenhower box and

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,210
it's trying to break down this idea for

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,950
everything we work on of whether it's

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,870
urgent whether we need to be doing it

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,420
right now or not and whether it's

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,980
important is this what my role is meant

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,050
to do or is it important for somebody

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,280
else I'm gonna be generous and assume

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,990
that all the work you're doing is

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,760
important for the company or the project

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,260
that you work on and it's only a

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,790
question of whether your role should be

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,580
doing this or whether this is

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,950
appropriate for someone else so this top

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,780
left portion of the diagram I'm not too

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,400
worried about if it's urgent for your

00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,840
role if it's urgent for the company and

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,670
it's important for your personal role

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,230
I'm gonna guess that you're working on

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,580
it right now if you're not you're

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,290
probably gonna hear from somebody real

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,820
soon and they'll correct you and they'll

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,830
let you know hey this is both important

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,380
and urgent so you've probably got this

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,180
under control

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,560
this top right quadrant is a little

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,750
harder right these are things that are

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,940
really important to whatever your job is

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,370
right now but nobody is breathing down

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,040
your neck to make them happen and it's

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,240
super super easy for you to just

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,690
accidentally never work on this stuff

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,130
and so it's sort of the sum of these two

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,710
boxes that we want to pay a lot of

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,090
attention to and hopefully all those 40

00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,740
hours a week that we're working or going

00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:18,070
into something in this area and we want

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,830
to be intentional and correct on that an

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,970
old boss of mine Alex levy kind of

00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,470
talked about it like this and I

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,140
appreciate this because it seems out

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,210
from individual tasks it says look I'm

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,980
gonna sit down and just ask myself what

00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,900
should my role be working on right what

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,030
are the big challenges not the small

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,220
discrete tasks but the big challenges

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,170
and then I'm gonna pick a few of them

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,720
maybe three four somewhere in there and

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm gonna focus on those with my time

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,310
and then you get to zoom back down onto

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,720
the individual tasks and ask okay am i

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,290
working on things that further those

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,550
three or four goals

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,680
and this will hopefully capture a lot of

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,720
those longer tale less urgent things

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,560
that are still really crucial to your

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,540
current role and what that process is

00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,040
gonna do is it's gonna leave out a bunch

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,480
of stuff that you might be working on

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,270
right now right these are things that

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,730
are urgent they feel urgent your role is

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,810
maybe not perfect for them but it's not

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,540
like you can just drop them on the

00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,300
ground and forget about them and so that

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,980
brings us to our final section here what

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,930
do we do with all this work that we've

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,910
said I don't think it's right for me

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,280
maybe my boss and my colleagues agree

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:26,210
but someone's got to do it right we

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,610
can't just forget about it and I think

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,800
for me this is where a really a light

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,240
bulb moment happened when I realized

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,700
that I was mentally treating these

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,610
things as binary I was imagining that if

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,560
I filled a role in the past the only

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,330
option was for me to completely abdicate

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,760
responsibility or keep filling that

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,620
exact same role and when I say it like

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,080
that that's kind of silly of course it's

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,700
not that black or white and so I find it

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,050
useful to think about just the level of

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,640
involvement you have with a particular

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,700
task

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,040
I'm usually a little allergic to four

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,110
letter acronyms around business or

00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,000
around process but I actually find this

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,790
one super super relevant and useful

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,320
so the rasty model focuses on these four

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,450
traits and you can imagine these as

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,850
roles you can have within a particular

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,600
task or goal or project so I can be

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,010
responsible

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,510
which means I'm running around writing

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,030
code or maybe making something happen

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,370
there's usually a few of these I can be

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,170
accountable this is like the Project

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,790
Lead give or take so it's all on me to

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,060
make sure this thing happens correctly I

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,500
can be consulted think of this as sort

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,450
of someone's asking my expert opinion

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,550
and I come in for a little while and aid

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,220
in whatever they're trying to decide or

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,990
I can just be informed and this is like

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,600
an email right somebody says hey Scott

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,540
we're doing this fYI and that's kind of

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,070
the limit of my involvement so having it

00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,810
broken down like this it becomes pretty

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,430
clear that there's actually a few ways

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,230
you can be involved and they do not all

00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,940
have the same amount of time constraints

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,470
they do not all have the same amount of

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,350
authority within the project and those

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,570
are both good things so if I had an old

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,760
role where I was responsible for service

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,440
testing and I was also kind of leading

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,090
it within the team maybe I did this over

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,650
the course of a few years and this is

00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,950
really my expertise this is my

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,260
wheelhouse I might realize like oh my

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,240
new role really shouldn't be focusing on

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,559
this I don't want to leave it right I

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,120
don't want to drop it on the ground cuz

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,010
testing your service is still important

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,200
but I want to find somebody else I can

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,600
train up to take that responsible and

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,669
accountable position and I want to stand

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,320
off to the side maybe I'll be consulted

00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,490
maybe I really trust them and I'll just

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,080
kind of be informed of what they're

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,760
doing and there's gonna be a lower time

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,559
commitment for me and it's gonna give

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,149
them an opportunity to step up into that

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,649
role and at least for myself I have to

00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:38,779
be really careful of accidentally

00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:40,130
falling into those old roles it turns

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,110
out that if you've done something for a

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,299
long time if you care about it if you're

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,299
used to working on it it's super easy to

00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:48,860
find yourself just ending up still doing

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,510
those same roles so maybe I don't want

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,240
to be responsible or accountable for the

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,770
testing but hey I care and I'm here and

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,080
I saw you do it wrong so I'm just gonna

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,779
hop in and do it for a little bit and

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,490
that's really easy to accidentally do I

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:04,159
think there's a lot of ways to solve

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,740
this for myself I like something like

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,960
the Pomodoro system not because it makes

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,970
me a Productivity genius but because my

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,429
lizard brain is useless and it likes to

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,470
respond to shiny things so this is one

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:17,419
way to kind of keep it contained it'll

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,890
force me to ask as I start you know each

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,809
bit of work like hey what am i working

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,220
on right now hopefully I'm comparing

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:24,409
that against this list of things I said

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,299
was really important to me or maybe I'm

00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,190
just saying hey is the thing I'm about

00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,870
to do for service testing more like

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,640
being consulted or is it more like I'm

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,799
trying to be a project lead and adjust

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,240
accordingly so find what's right for you

00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,770
I don't think this is one size fits all

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,450
but the goal is to make sure you're

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,230
doing what you said you would do not

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,850
what you're used to doing and one of the

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,140
really exciting things about handing off

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,299
work to other people and especially

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,490
about taking sort of a leadership

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,049
position that you used to do and not

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,640
doing it anymore is you get an

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:55,610
opportunity to grow the people around

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,350
you so just because I've spent three

00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,179
years doing a lot of service testing

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,860
doesn't mean that other people wouldn't

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,409
like that challenge wouldn't learn a lot

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,120
from it they just need the right sort of

00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,590
fostering environment they need somebody

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,390
to stand there and help them out when

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,340
they get stuck and this is the role that

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,929
you can play and as a side benefit

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,309
you're doing less work as well right you

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,559
can focus on the things that you really

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,389
want to do so this is a

00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,279
opportunity for you to be honest right

00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:20,870
recognize that things are not as easy

00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,610
for other people if they're new to the

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,590
area but still set them up for success

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,960
and you get to work on the right stuff

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,470
while you're at it

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,990
Julie Pagano gave a talk a few pecans

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,879
ago about these sort of challenges the

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,919
invisible challenges working in tech and

00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:38,870
she covered a lot of topics I recommend

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,490
you go check it out but one of the

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,769
things she talked about was killing your

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,450
heroes and what she meant by this was

00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,980
she was talking about coming to PyCon

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,749
and seeing all these luminaries in the

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,879
field meeting them and just being

00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:52,399
awestruck right there's no way I could

00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:53,929
do this as well as they have I imagine

00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,429
that they were all born straight out of

00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,379
the womb writing cpython

00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,700
and like this is not something that I'll

00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:00,999
ever live up to

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,679
I just can't it's just not in my DNA and

00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:05,539
I really admire her point here which was

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,830
that's not true right no matter how much

00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:08,929
it might feel that way no matter how

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,090
much it might seem that way all of us

00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:13,009
got to where we are piece by piece we

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,110
often got to where we are by stretching

00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:17,690
a little bit and by having people there

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,539
to mentor us and support us and excel at

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,759
what we do so treat all the things that

00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:24,230
you hand off this way emphasize to the

00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,940
people that you're interacting with like

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,279
look I got here piece by piece

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,999
I learned this on the job so can you and

00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:34,999
I'm here to help you get there so let's

00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:38,299
wrap up here I hope I've convinced you

00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:39,350
that burnout is not good hopefully

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,480
that's also not something you

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,249
particularly needed convincing of but

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,649
the reality is we slip into it all the

00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:47,539
time so the core thesis of this talk is

00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:49,700
that being overloaded having too much to

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,289
do is bad for absolutely everybody it's

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,759
bad for you it's bad for your colleagues

00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:54,980
it's bad for the project or the company

00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:56,450
that you work within and what we want to

00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,460
do is take an intentional approach to

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,799
that it's not rocket science

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,200
these aren't particularly challenging

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,149
things to apply we're just not applying

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,840
them by default and it's worth giving it

00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:11,259
a shot and kind of the core argument

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,519
here is that it's worth it to do less

00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:15,470
you're doing too much right now by

00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,149
default it's easy to slip into a mode

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,529
where you're not particularly effective

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,840
because you're saying yes to everything

00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,879
and if you're interested in kind of a

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,519
management book that summarizes all of

00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:27,289
these concepts about focusing

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,820
essentialism is a pretty good read so it

00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,420
focuses in on this idea that look you

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,010
just need to be

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,660
doing a few things really well and

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,260
that's basically what we're talking

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,760
about when we focus on prioritization so

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,830
we want to make sure that we ourselves

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,890
are doing the right work and we also

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,270
want to be really sharing and honest

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,460
with the people that were around right

00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,320
emphasize the fact that look you don't

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,700
have to just say yes to everything you

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,800
can craft the stuff that you're working

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,360
on to a point where it's fits how much

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,540
time you have and you'll be better and

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,540
more effective for it so we talked about

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,370
three steps here number one we said look

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,510
before you can do anything about the

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,460
problem you have to know there's a

00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,990
problem and we talked about how it's

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,390
important to notice it as early as

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,280
possible in that process so that you can

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,810
go ahead and react to it quickly and you

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,720
have less work to dig yourself out from

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,550
underneath we said we wanted to

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,440
brainstorm sort of what we should be

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,970
working on with sort of the reality

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,830
behind the scenes being that what we are

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,690
working on and what we're sort of

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,670
forgetting or just not even thinking of

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,050
might really matter and if we take a

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,240
step back look at those high-level

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,970
challenges and then focus back in on

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,460
individual tasks we can sort of reorient

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,920
our self and be in a much better spot

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,320
and then after we've done that we're

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,640
gonna have a list of tasks that we know

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,780
we aren't going to work on these are

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,610
things that are left over

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,590
maybe we accidentally focused on them

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,060
but we can't just leave them alone right

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,920
they might be really urgent they might

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,540
be super important and we need to train

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,430
other people up to take that work off

00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,260
our hands so whether that's something

00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,940
that you just have a pet peeve about or

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,370
whether it's really important critical

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,890
work finding the right people who want

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,720
to step up who are capable of taking on

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,760
that challenge and then mentoring and

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,830
fostering them so that they succeed is a

00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,570
super rewarding process and for myself I

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,930
really like this idea of not having

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,250
Heroes of emphasizing all of our

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,440
humanity and the fact that we got here

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,990
piece by piece and everybody else around

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,000
us can learn to improve themselves - I

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,830
like superhero movies just as much as

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,020
the next guy but that's not really the

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,540
kind of dynamic I want in my team I want

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,260
everybody to realize that you know we

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,210
can all make it and so if I can have you

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,370
come away with one thing that you do as

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,200
a result of this I would love if you

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,460
really just took a little slice of the

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,800
time that you put into things like

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,440
efficiency into your

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,750
them configuration into how you handle

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,580
your email or try things like GTD and

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,590
just focus a little bit of the time on

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,150
this question of prioritization and of

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,860
noticing the fact that you have too much

00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,510
work to do upfront I think you're gonna

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,190
see really wonderful benefits from it

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,220
and I know it's worked really well for

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,990
me in the past so with that I'm Scott

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,490
trillion if you'd like to talk more

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,020
about this I'll be out in the hall or

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,790
down at the Yelp booth today and

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:16,980
tomorrow thank you all so much

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:16,980
