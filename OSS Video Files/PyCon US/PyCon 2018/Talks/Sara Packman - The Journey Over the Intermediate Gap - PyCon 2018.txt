Title: Sara Packman - The Journey Over the Intermediate Gap - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06

Description: 
	Speaker: Sara Packman

Congratulations on finishing your first tutorials or classes in python! In the parlance of the hero’s journey myth, you’ve had your ‘threshold moment”: you’ve started down a path that could lead to a long and fulfilling career. But the road to this glorious future is frustratingly obscured by a lack of guidance in the present. You know enough to realize that you don’t have all the skills you need yet, but it’s hard to know how to learn those skills, or even articulate what they are. There are no easy solutions to this problem. There are, however, a few fundamental things to know and advice to keep in mind. Drawing from my own experience and with input from others, I’ve compiled some helpful hints about the skills, tools, and guiding questions that will get you to mastery.

hello

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,670
this talk is the journey over the

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,309
intermediate gap by Sarah Pakman there

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,330
will be potentially time for some Q&A

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:28,470
afterwards and so we're looking forward

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:30,179
to hearing your talk thank you for that

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,810
introduction and thank you for coming to

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,489
my talk

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,290
um it's called the journey over the

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,020
intermediate gap that will be clearer

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,120
and clearer in a few minutes but first a

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,860
little bit about me that's my twitter

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,890
handle you can feel free to tweet at me

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,980
or follow me but I don't tweet very much

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,570
so it won't affect your feet at all but

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,370
I'm happy to have conversations on there

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,230
if you want to reach out to me I

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,690
graduate I went to HACC bright which is

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,280
a software engineering bootcamp thank

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,780
you yeah there was a bunch in the

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,829
audience for women in San Francisco I

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,539
graduated about three years ago and

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,000
since then I've been working as a

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,070
software engineer at Clover health we

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,740
make it's a Medicare Advantage plan you

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,780
can find out more about us later and I'm

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,450
an all-purpose nerd I love diving into

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,580
any kind of topic and learning much more

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,890
about it than I need to know and one of

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,610
my favorite topics to get into is myths

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,049
and mythological structures so in this

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,820
talk we're going to be using the hero's

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,619
journey as a metaphor for the whole talk

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,150
and the hero's journey is a structure

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,280
that underlies a lot of myths and

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,130
stories that we know here's a very

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,920
simplified version our hero starts off

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,509
in his home world or her home world it's

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,150
they get a little bit of basic training

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,220
and then they get a call to adventure

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,409
they step over the threshold and meet

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,979
some mentors and allies which help them

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,860
along the way

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,170
they have trials and challenges often

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,329
culminating in a capstone challenge

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,189
where they win a prize and return to

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,049
their home world it's often used as a

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,340
metaphor for life sometimes coming of

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,380
age any kind of journey of

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,060
self-discovery I'm going to use it as a

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,270
metaphor for the budding technologists

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,890
we pick we I talk picks up the story

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,360
right around the time when the hero is

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,459
trying to get themselves out of the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,840
beginner stage and into the special

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,500
world of learning and growing and

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,230
becoming

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,410
fully autonomous technologists so what

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,350
do I mean about the intermediate gap

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,820
around this time beginners are newly not

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,730
beginners are starting to look for

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,260
materials to help themselves advance but

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,380
a lot of materials are either too easy

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,180
or too hard so my exam I have an example

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,940
here consider the django girls tutorial

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,740
which is an excellent resource but from

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,950
my perspective which is the thing that I

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,750
tried when I first graduated hack right

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,370
this is what the django girls tutorial

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,410
teaches you teaches you how to install

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,790
Python do a little bit of terminal

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,730
navigation teaches you a little bit

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,870
about Django here's some models and how

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,780
you display the data and they're like

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,220
great go forth and build some stuff and

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,989
I kind of already learned how to do this

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,050
that was my experience at the bootcamp

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,400
and I'm surrounded everyday by web apps

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,370
that I know are way more complicated

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,110
than I know how to build and I so this

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,750
didn't really help advance my knowledge

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,910
at the time as I was putting together

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,770
this talk I went back and looked at it

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,540
and I see that they have a what's next

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,430
section that looks really great but I

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,060
didn't notice that before or it wasn't

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,150
there so that's an improvement and on

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,290
the other side things can be too hard so

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,959
this was a book that was passed around

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,970
my office at the time which has a lot of

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,000
good tips and but I found it very

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,380
difficult and I'm gonna show you why by

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,140
telling you what my thought process as

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,790
as I read this phrase so the first thing

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,940
it starts off as as explaining as

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,850
functions are first class objects okay I

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,769
looked at the table of contents I looked

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,750
at the index I looked throughout the

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,120
book but I could not find a definition

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,700
of first class objects anywhere so

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,500
already I'm a little confused but then

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,900
the next phrase he says meaning it's

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,220
like oh great he's going to tell me this

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,380
is why I read books I will learn now and

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,079
then he says you can refer to them

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,120
directly and I was like that's great I

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,430
know how to call functions is that the

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,220
same thing I'm not I don't really know

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,410
what that means exactly assign them to

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,760
variables well it must be something

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,930
different than calling an object and

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,790
assigning the output to a variable

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,610
because otherwise he would have said

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,770
that instead passed them as arguments to

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,150
other functions which is the thing I had

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,420
no idea what to do a function is the

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,310
thing

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,810
does something how do you pass a thing

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,810
that's doing something to another thing

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,600
made no sense to me you can compare them

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,220
in if statements which also made no

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
sense what does that even mean you have

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,300
two things that are eggs that can

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,710
execute code and then like what what

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
does that mean to be able to compare

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,450
those two things it was one function

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:56,880
better than the other no idea and then

00:04:48,450 --> 00:05:01,410
etc like what else can they do and also

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,030
what is the first class object so this

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,920
is a really great book I've gone back to

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,960
it now and I've found it useful but at

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,880
the time I didn't know some basic stuff

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,460
that it assumed that I know and it was

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,830
very hard for me to follow so everything

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,450
kind of feels like this cartoon which is

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,160
one of my favorite cartoons there there

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,930
are a lot of steps between beginner

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,580
things and advanced things but they're

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,930
not really documented anywhere and you

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,750
can't really figure out what they are

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,410
and I'm why is this why does this gap

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,540
exist

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,070
I don't really know but I've had some

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,540
theories based on my experience too

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,300
based on talking to some other people

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,950
one of them is that as no two people

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,680
that are stepping over that beginner

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,810
threshold are the same they bootcampers

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,030
have one set of experiences and within

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,980
them there's a hugely variable amount of

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,690
experience that they have college grads

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,130
have another one maybe a college grad

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,770
would know exactly what a post callous

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,670
object doesn't have no problem with that

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:59,220
that was not me and also so you can't

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,570
write a begin a tutorial for somebody

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,800
that might come at it from a million

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,530
different angles it would be hard to

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,210
write that one also at this point the

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,320
technologist has to start specializing

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,300
and there are so many different ways

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,920
that you can go you can be a web apps

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,510
engineer like me or you could be a data

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,820
analyst you can be a data engineer

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,200
you're going to IT security it's you

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,200
can't write one tutorial that might

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,510
cover all of those things so this is

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,010
very frustrating for the beginner too

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,740
because there's no way to sort of get

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,650
yourself out of this but I learned that

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,690
there that you can get through it I know

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,460
this because I held an open space last

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,920
year on this particular topic and I got

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,900
a lot of really good feedback also this

00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,570
is sort of reflective of my journey as I

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,580
went through B as I sort of went through

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,689
this phase as a software engineer

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,639
clover health I worked really hard and I

00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:49,590
learned a bunch of things absolutely

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,939
both my experience and through the open

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,879
space that I'm going to share with you

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:56,370
today so what do I learn how did you go

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,740
forward from here the first step is

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,419
often overlooked but it bears stating

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,900
you have to actually step over the

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,240
threshold

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,759
heroes have a call to adventure and they

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,099
can choose to not do it but they all do

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,349
it otherwise there would be no story in

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,909
the same way technologists often feel

00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:13,349
like they're not ready to start to get

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,930
out there and start coding to start

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,969
working and trying to do things but you

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,650
have to get there that's the only way to

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:22,229
learn where you're strong and where you

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,270
can spend some time learning and it's

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,370
helpful to remember at this point that

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,810
it's really hard but the heroes are

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,060
often not ready when they make that

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,759
first step over the threshold they have

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,469
a lot of learning and growing to do the

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,750
second step is to find your mentors

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,699
heroes typically have mentors and allies

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,550
that are key to their success they're

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,370
very important teachers and helpers but

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,690
do not complete the journey for the hero

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,930
similarly you also need to find some

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,639
people that you can ask for help but you

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,440
cannot expect them to actually do the

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
work for you

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,729
your mentors are a light and allies are

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,460
people that have more experience in a

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,719
particular area than you usually they

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,520
can help explain the different

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:05,039
technology disciplines remember I said

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,120
you have to start specializing often

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,129
beginners don't even know what those

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,650
specializations means so the best way to

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,669
figure that out is to talk to people

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,650
they can help you get started on

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:15,120
projects and suggest good projects to

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,310
work on to help test out your skills

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,169
they can also answer questions which is

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,879
incredibly important if you find

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,009
yourself stuck as a beginner on

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,990
something it's much better just to go

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,940
ask for help than to sit there and

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,440
wallow it's especially important because

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,330
one of the biggest blockers for

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,130
beginners growth is the specialized

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,199
vocabulary in different technology

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,029
disciplines your mentor can give you an

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:39,630
answer to those definitions much faster

00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,640
than you can googling around you can

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,899
find mentors and allies if through a

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,820
number of different ways if you're

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,930
already working the best source of

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,940
mentors and allies are your co-workers

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,640
the people that sit right next to you

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,190
many of that I can easily say that

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,260
without many of the support of my car

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,300
many co-workers support I

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,100
not be here as software engineer I would

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,650
not have ever come to PyCon and I would

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,200
not even be giving this talk I rely on I

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,110
relied on them extensively you can also

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,760
find mentors through alumni associations

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,830
I know the hack right one in particular

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,780
is very strong and the women there are

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,910
always ready to help newer graduates

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,550
along the way there are a variety of

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,580
community groups pi ladies software and

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,590
data carpentry can are there to teach

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,330
and to help spread knowledge of

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,920
technology to a lot of people so they

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,800
are people ready and willing to work

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,140
with you and there's also domain

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,970
centered groups like programming for

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,070
historians that know exactly the unique

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,870
technology technological problems that

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,890
you might want to be solving in a

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,200
particular domain

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,550
there's also open source projects as you

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,560
get in there's a lot of people there

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,210
willing to review code and help and you

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,020
can develop relationships there that way

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:51,360
help you go forward the next thing is to

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,550
learn to work work collaboratively

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,160
heroes have a team of people to help

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,630
them along the way and similarly you

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,450
need you need to learn how to work on a

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,010
team as a technologist students and new

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,080
technologists often work by themselves

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,660
it's a very lonely pursuit but out in

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,460
the world you have to work on a team in

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,520
order to build something that's strong

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,740
and robust but most importantly learning

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,080
to work with other people helps you grow

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,030
it exposes you to new techniques much

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,890
like Moana right here is learning how to

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,630
sail from Maui just by watching him

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,490
that's the same way you what you learn

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,110
watch other people code you read their

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,630
code and you get exposed to things that

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,490
you wouldn't have thought of before

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,470
code reviews are the best are one of the

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,240
best ways to do this but a lot of the

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,490
benefits of code reviews are also

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,140
present during pair programming either

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,360
way it's important for you to see

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,370
someone else's code so that you can see

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,920
new techniques and also get your code

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,810
reviewed this is part of one of some of

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,930
my own code and someone explaining to me

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,860
the benefits of breaking down the codes

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:55,380
into easily testable pieces the fourth

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,690
is to rely on the work of others heroes

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,700
always have some sort of tool that is

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,830
left behind by an ancestor often it's a

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,090
broken sword in the scene Moana is

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,500
finding a bunch of boats that her

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,400
ancestors left behind and they forgot

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,000
about these tools are key to the hero's

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,700
completing

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,070
Jurnee similarly you've got some tools

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,820
that people have have left behind for

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,920
you this looks like pythons vibrant

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,390
ecosystem there's a lot of stuff in the

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,430
standard library that can help you get

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,830
over standard problems like parsing a

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,240
CSV it's much easier just to call into

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,700
that library than to actually worry

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,140
about formatting finding all the commas

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,740
in the string and breaking up the data

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,360
along that along them you can also rely

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,310
on third-party libraries like requests

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,260
requests you can get can help you get

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,380
and post from different services without

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,090
worrying about the details of HTTP these

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,500
are just two examples there are so many

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,540
more in the standard library and on

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,040
third-party packages and talking to your

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,920
mentors and allies is a great way to

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,650
learn about more of them just to find

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,970
just a note on this one I when I was

00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,580
going through this it felt like cheating

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,100
to learn the library because I needed to

00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,900
I felt I needed to understand everything

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,510
understand how everything works and I

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,060
felt like I was shortcutting myself if I

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,650
use the library but that's not and

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,180
that's a good instinct but it's not

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,930
really super helpful for someone who's

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,520
just stepping over the threshold they

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,530
the library can help you get past

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,410
problems there's no sense in sitting

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:25,140
there struggling through a problem that

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,600
has already been solved it's much more

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,220
useful to complete a project and then

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,170
when you feel you have a solid

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,760
understanding of a system as a whole you

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,710
can go back and look at these libraries

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,330
many of them are written in Python so

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,950
they're readable and you can learn by

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:42,870
reading the code and maybe you can even

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:45,000
improve it fine the next step is to get

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,370
to know your tooling heroes have several

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,380
tools and tricks to help them on their

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,240
journey coders also have an array of

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,770
helpful tools that can help them that

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,900
can be helpful but they can also feel

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,180
confusing if you haven't put in the time

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,830
to learn them and it does feel like a

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,370
lot of time and it does feel like a lot

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,750
of time that you that isn't really along

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,589
the lines of learning how to write

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,480
Python but it's so helpful you if you

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,670
have a good well configured toolset

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,680
you'll get some fun stuff in your editor

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,160
like syntax highlighting text completion

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,350
and text manipulation linters are really

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,770
underrated because they can help correct

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,870
your code

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,240
and help you detect like when you've

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,860
mistaken forgot to define a variable or

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,510
when you accidentally have one equal

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,370
sign instead of two

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,350
and they can also clean up your code

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,760
before you put it up for review so that

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,290
your reviewers can focus on the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,440
structure of your code rather than the

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,540
small stylistic points finally learning

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,450
how to use a debugger and rep and a

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,250
repple is so helpful guess it lets you

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,590
step through your code line by line and

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:52,000
seeing what's happening on every step of

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:53,530
the execution brief note I had a lot of

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,450
conflicting advice on this when I was

00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,310
coming up and I confused me so I just

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,370
want to break this down right now there

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,110
are two types of code of waist edit code

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,600
one is an integrated development

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,160
environment an IDE they come with a lot

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,280
of this stuff kind of already built in

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,830
along with like how-to syntax analysis

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,260
and a lot of other useful tools some

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,820
people swear by this because the ID can

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,430
actually teach them about the language

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,380
as they go alternatively you can just

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,510
get a text editor some of them come with

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,360
syntax highlighting already built in but

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,680
they're pretty bare-bones the good thing

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,750
about this is you can focus on learning

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,600
code and not learning your text editor

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,950
this is the path I chose but either is

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,690
good it's really up to your personal

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:40,750
style I'm going so fast so try and slow

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,000
down um so then the last thing here is

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,950
study is to study I know I was pretty

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,030
down on studying before you shouldn't I

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,680
said you should get out there and

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,820
practice and not worry about having to

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,430
learn and everything before you get out

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,050
there but once you have been practicing

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,540
for a while and you have an idea of

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,520
things that are confusing to you it's

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,830
useful to go back and look at books and

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,930
courses that might be helpful but choose

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,760
wisely you don't want to waste time on a

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,060
course or a book that's not really

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,470
working for you you to get find a book

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,120
that works for you pick them that pick

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,080
some that match your learning style if

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,700
you learn by doing

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,620
don't pick a book that has a lot of

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,450
explanatory text because it will just go

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,010
right over your head pickup up that has

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,630
tutorials in it that can help you

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,040
understand where I'll walk you through a

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,710
project and help you understand what's

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,960
actually happening it's okay to pick up

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,930
books that seem too easy this will force

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,390
you to practice and review the stuff

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,930
that you've already learned before you

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,149
and it's good to go at your own pace but

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,940
be wary of going too slow that can be an

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,960
indication that the resource is too

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,820
advanced for you and that you need to

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:46,649
set it aside for a later time what do I

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,450
learn a lot of this advice is super high

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:49,920
level here's some concrete advice about

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,990
books that might be good to pick up no

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
matter where you're going the first is

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,830
version control the most common version

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,149
control I know about is git that's what

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,899
I use every day but there are other

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:03,149
kinds so with git it would be it's good

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,680
to know how to commit code in it's good

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,390
to know how to choose what code you

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,310
commit this is called staging and git

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,990
and it's also important to know how to

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:15,180
branch or fork and make a pull request

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:16,920
into a master branch testing has been so

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,930
helpful to me and it's really important

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,520
to learn how to test it's good it's

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,080
important to know what makes a good test

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,180
and when is it appropriate to write a

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,860
test it can help you it can also help

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,450
you develop faster because it allows you

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,190
to test little pieces of code in

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,110
isolation to make sure that it works

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,120
rather than having to set up a whole

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,940
environment just to check that like one

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,290
method works command line is chell

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,850
navigation this is how you're going to

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,990
interact and how you're going to with

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,089
your computer and how you're going to

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,560
run code you need to know how to

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,980
navigate through directories make new

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,700
ones delete stuff create new files read

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,290
the files use cat see the permissions on

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,970
different files because otherwise you'll

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,370
waste hours trying to figure out why you

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,589
can't edit anything and you need to know

00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,940
how to get rid of things finally

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,360
learning how to manage your environment

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,860
is super important I spent so much time

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,179
on trying to figure out why things were

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,770
going wrong when it was something messed

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,120
up in my environment it's really

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,339
important to know how to create a new

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,160
one see what's in your environment add

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,020
stuff to it and then destroy it all and

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,589
rebuild it when it just gets completely

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:22,709
messed up so I'm almost done I just have

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,449
a few last things to say my first last

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,610
slide is a summary of what we talked

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,309
about remember to actually get out there

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,690
and start practicing and start working

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,940
find some mentors and allies to help you

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,830
along the way work collaborative so you

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,170
can build bigger and better stuff and

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,880
learn from those around you make use of

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,380
libraries so that you don't get stuck

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,660
solving a problem that's already been

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,460
solved spend the time to learn your

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,590
tools and set them up the way you like

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,280
them and study things that are confusing

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,690
to you but

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,390
don't waste time on resources that

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,480
aren't working to you my second last

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,060
slide is a theme that emerges I was sort

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,980
of putting this together and it's that

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,100
incremental progress is really important

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,520
it's kind of the road to mastery here is

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,470
very long and there's a lot to learn no

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,550
matter which direction you go it will

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,620
feel like you have to learn everything

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,450
all at once but don't do this human

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,730
brains can absorb that many that much

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,290
information all at once take things one

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,600
step at a time and remember to practice

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,880
what you have learned before to make

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,400
sure your foundations are strong before

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,360
getting on to something else

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,820
and my last last slide is a warning and

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,670
a little bit of a pep talk this is

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,500
really hard the hero has a capstone

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,440
challenge and often this is called the

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,510
abyss you're gonna face giant problems

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,430
you're gonna face giant mean scary lava

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,910
monsters you're gonna and it's going to

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,590
be really difficult but you will get

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,760
through it in this scene

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,410
Milana has already figured out the

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,140
answer she already knows how to get her

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:55,860
prize and she will succeed I hope that's

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,930
not a spoiler and I'm here to tell you

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,950
that with practice perseverance and

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,570
patience you will also get through it

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,430
thank you very much i'm from clover

00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,200
we're hiring so come say hi at the job

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,810
fair tomorrow and that's my talk thank

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,270
you for attending

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,270
[Applause]

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,110
Sara thank you that was a wonderful talk

00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:27,490
filled with some great gems thank you we

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:29,880
have a few moments for Q&A we ask that

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:33,190
you keep your questions short and direct

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,230
to the speaker and if you have longer

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,270
questions or comments that you please

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,340
wait until after the talk to discuss

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,960
them with Sara

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:45,270
if anybody have any questions please

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,270
form a line right here at the microphone

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,980
hey Sara thanks so much for the great

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,140
talk really appreciate it thank you in

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,830
one of your slides you gave a list of

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:03,970
some general CS things like version

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:06,790
control and testing and so forth I was

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:11,080
wondering if you could also share with

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:13,660
us Python concepts that you found to be

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,040
more intermediate level I understand

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,230
people have different opinions about

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,220
this but would love to hear from your

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,770
experience what Python specific

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:28,390
roadblocks you may have come across yeah

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:30,280
so I think okay I have to think about it

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,559
for a second but I think the question

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,870
was about Python specific roadblocks or

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,120
things that were really useful I think

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,370
kind of understanding more about object

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,470
Python objects as objects and classes

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,360
that can be edited and things that you

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,070
can do stuff and objects that you can do

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,559
stuff with was really important for me

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,970
um also like the whole first class

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,890
object thing and understanding that

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,330
functions are also objects just like all

00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,620
the other objects and you can do the

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:58,120
same kinds of stuff of that that was

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,470
also pretty key yeah and then learn but

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,630
learning how to use libraries is

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,490
actually one of the biggest ones because

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,710
I I was the person that spent a lot of

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,330
time trying to like parse a CSV by

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,070
finding the commas when I could have

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:13,000
just like plugged it into CSV so I think

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,590
getting out there and building will be

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,840
much more useful than like deep-diving

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:20,200
on Python specifics you'll learn the

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,110
specifics as you build stuff thank you

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,420
oh go ahead sorry are you aware of any

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,860
like online resources where you can get

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,200
mentorship like

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,870
during kind of relationships like is

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,120
there a place on the internet I can like

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:37,030
push a big like piece of co2 and then

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,860
someone will review it for me that's a

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,470
really good question and the good news

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,540
is that some are coming up the bad news

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,510
is none of them really have a lot of

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,940
sway that I know about I know that Stack

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,250
Overflow recently introduced a code

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,990
review feature that people could use I

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,240
also know that there's like a lot of

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,150
interview prep sites like exorcism do

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,540
where you could design an algorithm to

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,669
an interview question and then someone

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,590
will like critique your algorithm but

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:07,179
that's not quite the same as code review

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,540
because interview questions are their

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,580
own special breed of problem there is

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,350
not one that I know about just yet

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,740
although I know some people have had an

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,090
idea for building just such a site so

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,530
maybe I'll if you follow me on Twitter

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,870
I'll tweet about it when it's up and

00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,270
running but yes I agree we need those

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,309
things thank you for your question thank

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,010
you for the talk I was wondering for

00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:31,630
books to read or resources if there was

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,669
any that you found really helpful for

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,370
your journey and any that you like to

00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:38,559
share yes so I don't know if you noticed

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,650
but all of those are links and I will be

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,559
sharing these slides out on Twitter

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,410
afterwards so feel free to look at them

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,330
and see these are links to the thing to

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,250
my favorite tutorials on each of these

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,240
topics there are lots of them though so

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,490
you're going to have to find that one

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,480
that works for you the version control

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,940
one is a link to the at lassen tutorial

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,980
which is good for staging committing

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,049
branching pull requests all the things

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,840
that I talked about the testing one

00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:10,570
links to test driven development Python

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,250
which is obey the testing goat command

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,900
line is Sheldon no obligation links to

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,970
the appendix and learn Python the hard

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,070
way because that has a lot of really

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,120
good stuff in it for navigating the

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,070
terminal

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,860
and Pyun bin Conda just links to the

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,450
documentation for piping Conda there's

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,830
not like tutorials about it it's more

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,240
about you should learn to use these

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,840
things by building it yourself by

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,940
building your own projects yeah my

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,210
question is how do you know what to

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,010
learn next like is you hit a block

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,010
somewhere where you're like oh okay I

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,490
know more than the

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:47,120
people around me but I know I don't know

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:49,580
that much and I want to improve but I

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,550
don't know where to start or even where

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,100
to go yeah so how do you get out with

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,990
that home yeah so first of all if you

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,190
look around and you say I know a lot

00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,960
more than the people around me but I

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,210
don't know that much like just be aware

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,710
of impostor syndrome is a thing and

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,130
maybe that's your impostor syndrome

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:10,760
talking but how do you how do I pick

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,770
what to learn more it really depends a

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,200
lot on those kinds of things you're

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,000
curious about like for me right now I'm

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,190
starting to feel pretty solid in writing

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,860
web apps and Python so I'm starting to

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,230
try and learn other stuff and like I'm

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,360
some for some reason drawn to like

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,370
learning a more low-level language and

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,230
understanding how the computer actually

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,090
works even though that's not something

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,280
that I use in my day to day life so

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,560
that's just been a thing I'm curious

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,610
about and that's what I'm gonna try to

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,770
find time to learn about yeah I think

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,730
just staying curious and observant the

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,280
stuff that it sort of piques your

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,390
interest I don't have any good answer

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,390
because there are so many ways that

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,160
could go build something that you're not

00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,990
familiar with like get hardware if you

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,070
don't know hardware like just find

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,460
something you've never learned before

00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:02,800
and be a beginner at that Thanks yeah

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:06,020
thank you Hey

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,100
the question I had was regarding I you

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,500
had a lot of great examples like

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,660
communities you can rely on for for

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,040
sharing knowledge and learning from yeah

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,370
I was wondering if there's like any

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,140
slack groups or like more real-time yeah

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:21,110
communication platforms that you've used

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,910
and you found really helpful well a lot

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,590
of the slack groups that I use in real

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,350
time communication stuff that I use is

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,850
is based off of these groups like I'm in

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,910
the pie lady slack and in the hack right

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,460
slack I'm sure a lot of other groups

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,530
have slack channels I not I don't have

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,120
time to wander out and look at all the

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,430
slacks but like there's a lot of them

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,650
that you can join I also tend to be

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,450
focused on women's centered groups just

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,220
because I want to it's important to me

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,370
to bring more women into technology so

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,050
that's where I go but yeah there's a lot

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,520
I don't know any off the top of my head

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,320
but keep out keep your ears open and

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,150
I think SF python has a slack for

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,400
example which is a more general user

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:04,470
group so yeah thanks yeah thank you so

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,570
this will be quick one of the previous

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,440
questions was about how to know what

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:13,140
where to look at next I would like to

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,600
just say that one two things you can do

00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,360
to sort of keep your interest piqued on

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,800
what else is going on is listening to

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,890
podcasts there are a couple good

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,050
podcasts on Python Python bites has news

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,610
things that are coming around and talk

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,340
Python to me there are a couple others

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,960
and then looking for mailing lists there

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,250
are two that I'm subscribed to but I

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,230
can't think of what they're called off

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,540
the top my head but you just see things

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,820
come in like new projects that are going

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,960
on or news that's happening in you'll

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,760
see something that piques your interest

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,520
like oh I have no idea anything about

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,950
that and you know when you're getting

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,440
bored and not sure what to look at next

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,970
just stuff flying at you will kind of

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:58,980
give you an opportunity to look at new

00:26:50,970 --> 00:27:00,060
things thank you alright if there are no

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,410
further questions

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,820
let's give Sara another round of

00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:10,810
applause

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:10,810
