Description: 
	Speaker: Shannon Turner

Knowing how to code and being able to teach it are two separate skills. When we have expertise in a subject, it's common to take for granted that we'll be able to effectively communicate our expertise to someone else. Come learn (or re-learn!) how to teach and discover practical examples you can put to work right away.

By sharpening your teaching skills, you'll be a more effective mentor, trainer, and team member.

hello everybody um this is going to be

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:15,150
your next birth here sides each one with

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:17,550
an eternal hello everyone and thank you

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,920
so much for coming to my talk

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,490
I'm Shannon Turner and this is you are

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,439
an expert here's how to teach like one

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,080
when we have expertise in the subject

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,699
it's really common to take for granted

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,669
that we'll be able to effectively

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,280
communicate that expertise to someone

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,469
else because knowing how to code and

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,410
being able to teach it these are two

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,550
separate skills so today you will learn

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,539
or perhaps relearn how to teach and in

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:52,800
so doing become a better mentor manager

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,079
teacher and presenter so first a little

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,219
bit about me I am the founder of here me

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,890
code like I am woman hear me code which

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,739
offers free beginner friendly Python

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,150
classes for more than 3,000 women in the

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,680
Washington DC area

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,680
I started

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,910
thank you I started informally teaching

00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,250
just a small group of friends who I know

00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,620
who wanted to learn how to code and I

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,900
did this around my kitchen table and I

00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,950
never really imagined that hear me code

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,370
would be a thing but it has grown and

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,640
totally taken over my life so this talk

00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,480
is really based on everything that I

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,150
have learned that I could cram into

00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,670
thirty minutes this is based on you know

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,729
I developed the curriculum for the first

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,150
eight months I taught every single class

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,250
and now I hardly ever get to teach

00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,650
because the students have become the

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,660
teachers I do one-on-one train the

00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,229
trainers with every single teacher and

00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:04,710
I've been a teaching assistant many many

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,750
times and so I think these are the four

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,690
main categories of advice that I would

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,190
give to you to help you be a better

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,950
teacher mentor manager and presenter

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,940
because I think these four categories

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,690
are really what you need to keep in mind

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,400
as you're presenting so number one know

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,040
your audience number two use examples

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,410
that connect number three know what to

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,260
hold back and number four foster a love

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,720
of learning to start off know your

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,810
audience and here I want to take my own

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,780
advice and say who is going to get the

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,330
most out of this talk do you have to be

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,480
a teacher in a formal setting do you

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,720
have to have any teaching experience

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:55,049
definitely not this talk I am aiming it

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,330
at folks who maybe manage a junior

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,810
developer and want to help them reach

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,760
their potential someone who manages

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,430
mid-level developers and wants to see

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,150
them grow into senior developers maybe

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,269
you teach coding at any level formally

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,790
or informally or help others to pick up

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,040
these skills or maybe you're thinking

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,400
about giving a talk at PyCon next year

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,859
and want to pick up some tips so if you

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,170
fall into any of those categories or

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,830
adjacent to I think you're going to get

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,290
a lot

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,500
out of this talk and I'm hoping to give

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,530
you practical takeaways that you can put

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,780
to use right away to help you be a

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,100
better presenter better teacher better

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,540
mentor and better manager so first off

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,000
with know your audience

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,930
let's connect with them you might have

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,210
noticed that my very first slide was who

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,880
the heck am i why am i standing up here

00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,790
why might I be an expert on the subject

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,580
of teaching what can what can I offer

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,740
you why should you listen to me so

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,180
connect with your audience because

00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,180
you're gonna be spending a lot of time

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,680
together and I also like to take

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,690
attendance we're not going to do that

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,550
today but I like to take attendance

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:17,030
because I care about getting to know

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:20,190
them too next up what motivates them

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,680
find out what motivates your students

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,840
because if you know why they want to

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,850
learn and if you know what they want to

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,350
learn that can help you tailor your

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,970
lesson and when we have a large class

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,550
tailoring your lesson means touching on

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,220
the different motivations for people in

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,350
the room so for instance I framed this

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,450
talk as being interesting and applicable

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,620
to many different groups of people

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:50,630
people who are mentors managers thinking

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:55,680
about giving a talk next year and so on

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:58,380
and set expectations because people

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,870
attending your talk or taking your class

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,380
or learning from you should know upfront

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:08,100
what they're going to be learning so

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:11,880
that also helps you to set and create a

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,130
lesson goal and a lesson plan and you

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,380
should stick to that what do you want

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,570
students to take away from your lesson

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:25,470
for example I said for this talk that I

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:28,110
wanted to give all of you a series of

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,460
tips that you could put to use right

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:39,030
away to help you be a better mentor

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:41,880
manager teacher and presenter empathize

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,920
with your audience what is their level

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,440
of understanding and don't make

00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,990
assumptions because if you assume too

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,510
high then what you're talking about

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,940
might go over people's heads if you

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,250
assume too low you're probably being

00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,620
condescending and that's not going to

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,810
work out well now you could ask but keep

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,050
in mind that people may not want to be a

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,120
hundred percent truthful with you know

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,720
their level of comfort with the material

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,980
they might pretend to know things so

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,010
what's the solution here

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,040
I think it's reframing the way that you

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:25,440
teach so that it's accessible to people

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:28,680
at many different levels and kind of

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,230
related is don't make anyone feel less

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,390
than because nobody likes being talked

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,400
down to and if people feel like you're

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,560
talking down to them they're gonna tune

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,560
the rest of what you say completely out

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,229
remove distractions

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,000
what could get in the way of learning

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,120
this could be so many different things

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,880
and I want you to think really broadly

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,910
about what might constitute a

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,540
distraction this could be things like

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,270
can you see the the words up on the

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,970
screen is the font size too small is the

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,560
contrast not high enough Python does a

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,440
really great job of removing

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,380
distractions by even if you can't hear

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,530
me they've got live captioning which is

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,770
incredible think about all of the things

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,229
that might get in the way of learning

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,770
all of these roadblocks this could be

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,900
other things like sexist jokes

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,780
unexplained acronyms really take a broad

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,940
view anything that might get in the way

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,940
of learning and remove these roadblocks

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:44,190
and use live coding sparingly because a

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,890
little bit will go a long way now if

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,500
you're only doing live coding and you

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,780
don't have any slides this can be really

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,800
difficult to follow because students are

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,479
like looking at their

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,030
screen and trying to look up at yours

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,940
trying to follow along it can be really

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:03,599
challenging it's also difficult to refer

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,699
back to a known working example so if

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,039
you're going to use live coding that's

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,860
fine just make sure that it's not your

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,949
whole thing because that can be really

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,400
challenging it's also really prone to

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,520
errors and if you've ever like given a

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:24,210
live demo it's very nerve-wracking right

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:27,210
and you're prone to fixing those errors

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,789
on the fly and that might derail you and

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:33,149
you might not meet your lesson plan and

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:37,620
goals so if you're gonna do live coding

00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:41,899
just a little bit and remember your

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,360
journey where are they in their journey

00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:49,200
because nobody hits a home run the first

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,829
time think about how long it took for

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,250
you think about how you didn't become an

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,770
expert overnight think about how much

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,980
work it took for you to get where you

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:08,220
are and remember your journey try to

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,310
empathize with them smash jargon make

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,529
sure you define acronyms or insider

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,930
speak don't assume that everybody knows

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,770
what they are even if they're super

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,050
common to you or better yet use more

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,800
accessible language and a great way to

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,790
do that is keeping it conversational

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,560
speak as plainly as possible use

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,820
uncomplicated words to explain what you

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,500
mean or

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,829
pretend that you're having a

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,490
conversation with Python hey Python can

00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:44,310
you open up this file sure Shannon which

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,490
file I'd like you to open a tendis dot

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,250
CSV okay are you reading to that file

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,890
are you writing to it I'm reading from

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,410
it and even though I don't have code up

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,560
here you can all picture what that might

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,570
look like

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,779
so to recap because a little bit of

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,130
repetition is also a great teaching tool

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,470
know your audience can

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,470
next with them what can they learn from

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,260
you why should they listen to you find

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,110
out what motivates them what they want

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,590
to learn and why because that can help

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,230
you tailor your lesson accordingly set

00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,470
expectations so they know upfront what

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,120
they're going to be getting into

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,980
empathize with them what is their level

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,430
of understanding and don't make

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:36,300
assumptions don't make them feel lesson

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:38,190
nobody likes being talked down to remove

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,870
distractions and think about

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,770
distractions in the broadest possible

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,640
terms you use live coding sparingly

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:50,280
because a little bit goes a long way

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,560
remember your journey because you didn't

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,500
become an expert overnight and you

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,870
shouldn't expect them to either smash

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,860
that jargon make sure that you're

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:04,500
defining acronyms or other common

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,850
concepts even if you are super

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,770
comfortable with them and you already

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,230
know what it is make sure you're

00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,500
defining it and keep it conversational

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:17,010
use uncomplicated words to explain what

00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,760
you mean next up we're going to move to

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,800
examples that connect number one rule of

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,820
this is to use examples that people

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,250
already understand here me code we take

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,880
attendance to teach for loops and we do

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:36,860
it again to teach enumerate this is a

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,500
photo with how we do that so we have a

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,390
couple of folks standing up one way that

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,740
attendance can look is you stand up you

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,130
say your name you sit back down

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,530
and this is actually how we teach for

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,300
loops in here may code and what that

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:55,020
code might look like would be something

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,930
like for name and attendees print name

00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:01,440
so this is something that people are

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,390
very familiar with already and so when

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,420
it comes time to learning for loops it

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,460
really does connect well with people

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,550
other examples that are great for things

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,010
like loops and lists include things like

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,190
days of the week months of the year

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,810
these are things that people already

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,819
understand

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:26,560
so you don't have to explain them

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:29,050
already they make for great examples use

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,480
specific examples

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,449
fubar and bass I'm sorry but they don't

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,629
mean anything it's just an abstract

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:42,019
generalization and even if you're

00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:44,269
comfortable with foo bar and Baz new

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:47,899
learners really struggle with it and

00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:50,779
it's really confusing so I want to

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,790
challenge you because I know folks use

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,199
foo bar and best because it's easy its

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,290
quick you don't kind of think about it

00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:01,069
too much but I want to challenge you to

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:04,339
take a little bit of extra time and come

00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:06,579
up with an example that is specific

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:10,370
something that people will connect with

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:14,420
great way to do that is to draw on your

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,999
vast expertise right think about all of

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,920
the ways that maybe you have used these

00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:22,610
concepts that you're teaching in the

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,339
past think about how you have used these

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,399
concepts and work them in to your lesson

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,050
and ask yourself questions like how will

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,319
students be able to use what I'm

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:36,199
teaching another way of thinking about

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:39,740
this is don't just teach the syntax

00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:42,139
teach the context for why you're

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,410
teaching this right folks should know

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:48,889
right away why they'd be able to use

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,889
this what am i great my favorite

00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:55,639
examples of this is in here me code at

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:58,670
the end of each class we demo real skill

00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,209
level appropriate projects at the end of

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,059
the lesson

00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,750
and one of our frequent teaching

00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:08,389
assistants

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:11,949
she teaches with you know how you can

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:14,480
use string methods slicing and

00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,610
conditionals to validate whether a

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,889
social security number is valid or not

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,199
you can do all of this by the end of

00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:24,499
lesson one and that's a super practical

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:31,399
thing that she actually does in her day

00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:32,180
job ask yourself questions like why so

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,000
what

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,130
when will I use this because these will

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,400
these questions will help clarify one

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,350
fewer examples are practical and two if

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,040
you should be teaching this concept

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,620
right now or even at all and again when

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,780
you're thinking about your examples they

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,410
don't have to be applicable to every

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:57,890
single situation but examples that are

00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:01,610
clearly defined that relate to something

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,680
actually real and practical where you

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,470
understand why you're using something

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,060
those are the best examples those are

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:13,940
ones that really connect with people and

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,830
teach one concept at a time because it's

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,500
really difficult to learn more than one

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,450
thing at once and I don't just mean you

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,410
know making sure that your slides aren't

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:27,710
super cluttered although that too before

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:30,380
I took my own advice on this on here me

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,780
codes lesson two slides I was teaching

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,440
the three main ways that you could use

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:39,380
list dot pop all in a single slide I had

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,950
my list days of the week and I had days

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:46,100
of week dot pop to remove the last item

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:50,150
from the list I had days of week dot pop

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:54,050
index to remove a specific item from the

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:57,020
list and I had day is equal to days of

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:00,320
week dot pop to remove the last item and

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:03,010
save it into a variable I had all of

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,920
this on one slide what was I thinking

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:09,140
but now I've broken it all up onto three

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,210
slides and it's much easier to

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,240
understand because each concept comes

00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:18,020
one after the other so don't be afraid

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:22,130
of having a lot of slides it's better to

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:25,190
break them up and model good behavior

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,140
model that behavior that you want to see

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,910
and it's not just about having

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,610
meaningful variable names although

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,250
that's very important to make sure that

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,010
you are documenting things well make

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:41,740
sure that your code is readable rather

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:43,490
than clever and be flexible because

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,779
especially if you're knowing your

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,910
audience your examples

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,889
mic snacked with lots of folks but they

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,050
might not connect with everyone so you

00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:54,839
may need to use lots of different

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,790
examples even to teach the same concept

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,709
and you might think ah Shannon aren't

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,050
you being really repetitive and kind of

00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,970
restating the same thing over and over

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:07,559
again yeah

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,959
but it can work and mistakes are gonna

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,959
happen I'm sorry but they're just gonna

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,909
happen no matter how much you prepare

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,409
they're gonna happen so when you make a

00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:21,780
mistake turn it into a teachable moment

00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:25,949
explain what happened and narrate how

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:28,470
you're fixing it oh crap I've got got

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,549
this named error here it's telling me

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,500
that I haven't defined this variable oh

00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,570
it's because I made a typo I just

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:41,669
misspelled the variable name and there

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:43,830
now it's fixed but sometimes doing it

00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:46,470
wrong on purpose can actually clarify

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,419
what's happening so I hear me code when

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,399
we're teaching strings you know we teach

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,080
how you can use single quotes and you

00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:53,880
can use double quotes pretty much

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,970
interchangeably as long as you're

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,679
consistent but what happens when you you

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,760
when you start your string with a single

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,309
quote and end it with a double quote by

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,070
making these mistakes on purpose in

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,620
front of everyone this lets us talk

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,210
through the error message in front of

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,820
the group so when folks make that

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,940
mistake on accident next time they're

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,299
going to be really well prepared

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,580
so to recap examples that connect use

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:27,270
examples that people already understand

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:31,409
things like taking attendance days of

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,500
the week months of the year use specific

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:38,070
examples and when you can be practical

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:42,059
drawing on your experience of how you

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:46,080
have used this concept to in your day

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:48,090
job or somewhere else so draw on your

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,730
experience and use those practical

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:54,030
examples ask yourself questions like why

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,559
so what when will I use this and make

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,929
sure that you're only teaching one

00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,220
concept at a time don't be afraid to

00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,110
break up

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,490
your slides into multiple different

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:08,280
slides model good behavior make sure you

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,130
are demonstrating what you would like to

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,559
see be flexible because even your best

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,490
examples might not connect with

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,289
everybody mistakes are going to happen

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,140
so turn them into teachable moments and

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:25,760
sometimes doing it wrong on purpose can

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,320
help clarify what's actually happening

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,020
next we're gonna go to know what to hold

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,390
back answer the question that was asked

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,400
try not to go too far off script or

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,340
ad-lib too much or go on a tangent

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,159
because this can end up being much more

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,320
confusing than than enlightening so try

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:51,740
to ask them answer the question that was

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:55,200
asked of you nuance isn't always helpful

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,030
teach the most common situations because

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,159
that painful corner case that you've

00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:05,460
bumped up against they might never

00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:10,740
encounter it and teach the pool not the

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:15,059
ocean learning is like an ocean it's

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,820
impossibly vast it's deep it's murky

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:21,330
there's lots of pressure and it's filled

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:23,909
with sea monsters which is why when

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:28,320
we're learning to swim we start off in a

00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:30,600
pool don't overwhelm new learners with

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,070
that ocean of information that they will

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,490
eventually learn teach the pool not the

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,070
ocean

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,840
no one is relevant in the moment and

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:45,780
what is best saved for later and don't

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,720
cover too much material I will say that

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,090
I cut so much material from this talk

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,870
that I really wanted to include that was

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:58,320
super important to convey but there just

00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,360
isn't enough time and so I had to cut

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,000
lots of material you'll you will

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,110
probably cover less ground than you

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,330
think so

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:10,559
make sure that you practice practice

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,539
practice time it and be ready to cut

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,919
even if it's material you really want to

00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,450
cover

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,490
so to recap knowing what to hold back

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,580
answer the question that was asked don't

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,710
go too far off script or on a tangent

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,860
nuance isn't always helpful so teach

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,769
those most common situations teach the

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,720
pool not the ocean don't overwhelm your

00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,700
new learners with that ocean of

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,549
information that they will eventually

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,240
learn and don't cover too much material

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:43,649
all at once

00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:48,460
finally let's foster a love of learning

00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:50,980
reward curiosity children ask the best

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:55,659
questions until it's crushed out of them

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:58,450
by tired adults we all start out curious

00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:02,009
and full of wonder children ask

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:05,190
questions like why is the sky blue

00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:08,169
questions that adults tend not to ask

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:11,409
questions that adults tend to take for

00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:17,019
granted but always questions like well

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:20,350
why what if right so encourage that

00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:22,749
curiosity reward it don't crush it out

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,629
of new learners because new learners

00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:29,740
start off asking these great questions -

00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:34,259
a great way to do that is with this

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:39,580
magic phrase I don't know let's find out

00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:42,940
this magic phrase reminds people that

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,399
you don't need to know everything it's

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,659
also an honest phrase because nobody

00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:54,009
knows everything it's a humbling phrase

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:58,139
remember this one another phrase I like

00:22:54,009 --> 00:23:01,539
is great question I love your instincts

00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:03,570
don't be annoyed when a learner is

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,980
mentally jumping ahead a few slides

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,289
asking about material that you're about

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,929
to cover because that's a sign that

00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:13,090
you're doing a good job that's a sign

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,649
that they are extrapolating from

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:20,139
something that you've taught them and

00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:23,649
celebrate progress give positive

00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:26,450
feedback to encourage growth but we all

00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:29,200
know that negativity stifles learning

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,400
makes us not want to do it anymore right

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,730
please keep this in mind when you're

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:39,800
posting on Stack Overflow and again

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:44,000
remember your journey you didn't become

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:48,170
an expert overnight but also you can be

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,690
the mentor that you wished you had you

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:56,300
can be that person to somebody else move

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,690
about if you're only if you only pay

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,610
attention to one slide make it this one

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,850
teaching concepts through movement makes

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:08,210
for unforgettable experiences what do I

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,560
mean by this here's a photo from lesson

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:15,440
one with how we teach slicing we have

00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,660
six people holding up cards one with

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,830
each character on it spelling out Python

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:24,050
py th o N and we have folks step forward

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,900
if they are part of that slice and we

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,690
call out different slices and this

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,720
really does work to you know teach

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:35,630
slicing but most importantly is people

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,520
remember it no matter how good your

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,620
slides are no matter how much time you

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,050
spent on them no matter how many times

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,180
you practiced people probably won't

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,150
remember your slides but they will

00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,760
remember activities they did as part of

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,700
your lesson one thing that we do to

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,040
teach enumerate is remember how we teach

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,740
for loops you know for name and

00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,290
attendees print name stand up say your

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,180
name sit back down so that's how we

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,940
teach for loops and once people have a

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,970
good grasp of for loops let's throw some

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,940
enumerate in there and now we ask folks

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,240
to stand up and say their index as well

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,000
as their name and so that helps to

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,940
solidify the for loops but also

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,910
enumerate when we teach zip we have

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,890
people form up into two lines we pair

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,190
them off like they're walking in a

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:31,430
wedding when I'm teaching while loops I

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,350
hold out a handful of candy and I have a

00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,670
volunteer say Haitian and can I have a

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,470
candy here you go

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,720
hey Shannon can I have a candy here you

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,250
go hey Shannon can I have a candy nope

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm all out

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:47,630
and this is actually how we teach these

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:50,480
concepts and people remember it we all

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,270
learn by teaching it is a great way to

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,659
reinforce and solidify what we've

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:59,179
learned it is a very humbling thing and

00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:02,080
no matter how many times you've taught

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:05,840
you will learn something new by teaching

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,179
but also your students will learn by

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,580
teaching as well so make sure that

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:13,340
you're creating opportunities for your

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,679
students to teach others one way I love

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,679
to do this and here me code is I will

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,350
walk one person through all of the

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:25,730
installation the setup and running their

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:28,100
first hello world and then I say can you

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,549
show your neighbor can you walk them

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,440
through them right away it solidifies

00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,650
what they learned and it creates a bond

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,690
between people at the same table and it

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,419
gets set up an installation done really

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,240
quickly

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:46,909
so to recap fostering a love of learning

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,740
reward curiosity don't crush that

00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:51,200
curiosity of you're out of your new

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,720
learners great way to do this is with

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,570
the magic phrases I don't know let's

00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:02,630
find out and great question I love your

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:06,260
instincts celebrate progress and move

00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,900
about if you can teach through movement

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:13,039
that is going to make for unforgettable

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,900
experiences we all learn by teaching but

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,850
your students will learn by teaching as

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:21,200
well so make sure that you're giving

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:23,780
them opportunities to teach and now you

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,390
are an expert you know how to teach like

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,130
one and I would love to hear about how

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:32,780
you're incorporating these learnings

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:35,600
into presentations talks tutorials all

00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,750
of that so please say hi at Shannon V

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,909

00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,100
slides and when the video is all

00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:47,120
finished I will also post it here

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,590
