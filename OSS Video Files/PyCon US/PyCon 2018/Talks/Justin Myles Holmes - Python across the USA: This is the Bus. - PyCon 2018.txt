	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
so we have Justin miles Holmes who's

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,550
living probably they dream everybody

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,219
would love to be dreaming would love to

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:26,600
be living right now so please help me

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:26,600
welcome Justin miles Holmes this is the

00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,180
first

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:46,649
the song of time

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:46,649
[Music]

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140
a reminder that we have a limited amount

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,870
of time together here now in a limited

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,730
amount of time on earth we of course

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,070
lost John Perry Barlow this year who I

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,440
think gave for my money the greatest

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,949
PyCon keynote in the history of Pike on

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,180
or at least that I know about so let's

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,080
get right to it let's talk about the bus

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,840
now of course talks about hardware are

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,520
not strangers to Pike on by any means

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,049
but this is a pretty big piece of

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,220
hardware there's a photo of the bus the

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,830
day that I got it

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,110
it's an international 3800 that's the

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,460
you know the truck which is used to make

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,729
lots of things not just school buses

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,819
it has Thomas coachwork Navistar t4 44

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,030
engine which is also now called a power

00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:39,000
stroke 7.3 the total weight rating is

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,819
29,000 pounds but we usually only have

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,550
about 13,000 between 13 and 14 thousand

00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:48,420
in it its diesel gets about 11 miles to

00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:51,090
the gallon and so just quickly run you

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,189
through our journey on the bus we

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,520
started in May 2016 in New Paltz New

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,210
York we visited I think 35 States maybe

00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,700
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,009
dozens of national forests parks all

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,229
kinds of conferences festivals you know

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,939
wonderful beautiful get-togethers with

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,229
lots of lovely humans across the

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,220
continental US and a little bit of

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:14,160
Canada we ended December 2017 in Fresno

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,070
California at Derek Payton's house he

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,420
was really awesome at you know he let us

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,920
park our bus there for quite a while and

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,670
we used his hackerspace to continue to

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,440
build on it

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,109
our longest off-grid stretch was 71 days

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,829
and by off-grid stretch I mean we didn't

00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:34,410
plug in to the regular power grid we

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,780
didn't use any power from the alternator

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,900
so we didn't use any power derived from

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,690
any petrochemicals at all and that

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,980
includes a drinkable water cold beer in

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,690
Star Trek right we have standards

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,040
so yeah the fridge and the electronics

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,519
all have to be working for us to count

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,290
it as an off-grid day this is Gabbie

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,810
Simard more she painted a beautiful

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,760
mural for us she couldn't come to the

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,090
talks but she will be here for the

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,860
sprints

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,140
this awesome mural that she painted I

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,730
think want us a lot of goodwill around

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,930
the country here we are in the

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,170
Everglades

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,370
here we are the tiny-house festival of

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,349
Georgia which is a pretty awesome

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,730
gathering and we were had Lions out the

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:17,680
door the whole day of people that wanted

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,290
to see all kinds of things going on in

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,629
the bus here we are camping at a state

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,640
park in the Dakotas under the redwoods

00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,709
and of course last year at PyCon many of

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,290
you took the opportunity to hang out

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,200
with us in the bus and we really loved

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,450
having those those guests all those

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,609
guests at PyCon and elsewhere here's the

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,680
primary crew myself my partner Chelsea

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:43,959
and our offspring Fibonacci interesting

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,389
you know if it Bonacci has most afib

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,019
Minaj's life has been in the bus so

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,459
that's kind of an interesting

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,989
perspective to keep in mind it's not

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,230
something I'm gonna go into in depth in

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:56,170
this talk but so here's the question for

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,250
the audience as I described this journey

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,049
and only a little bit of detail so far

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,790
how many of you think either right now

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,889
or recall having thought in the past

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,109
when a similar journey was described of

00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,940
living in a tiny house or a bus or a van

00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,769
how many of you think oh I've always

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,889
wanted to do that raise your hand if

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,349
that thought occurs to you right so it's

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:19,810
what is it 90% right it's almost

00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:22,720
everybody this is what everybody says

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,729
this is what the grocery store clerk

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,470
says this is what the gas station

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,180
attendant says what everybody that we

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,610
talk to when it's parked somewhere and

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,860
it's a really hard thing to respond to

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,660
so a lot of my talk is the rest of my

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,090
talk is just gonna be kind of responding

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,889
to that notion I've always wanted to do

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,199
that first thing to think about is well

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,120
why were we able to do it

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,800
obviously there's privilege at work and

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,810
I think I'd like to set a precedent that

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,580
every pie can talk include an element of

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,500
how privilege helps the person achieve

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,020
what it is they're showing off we have

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,210
personal privilege you know like I'm I

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,490
work remotely and I'm a fairly in-demand

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,490
developer and I never had a lot of the

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,050
you know sort of ordinary economic

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,720
concerns that you might have if you're

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,479
working in one place at one job in one

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,159
city and of course the political

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,590
privilege that we enjoy we're a white

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:14,110
family driving around this nation's

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,690
highways

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,190
largely without fear of being pulled

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,390
over and eventually having an encounter

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,920
that leads to incarceration

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,760
statistically speaking if you're a

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,250
person of color

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,170
you're much more reasonable and having

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,630
paranoia on that topic and so we were

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,490
had the privilege of not needing to as

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,190
much not to say I had no paranoia by the

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,230
way and also it's just easier than it's

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,660
ever been to do this stuff right there's

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:40,420
videos on YouTube to do almost anything

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,000
that you'd want to do on the bus there

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,440
is a community a nationwide and of

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,630
course worldwide but for the purpose of

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,980
this talk nationwide community of Python

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,070
people that you can look up any little

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,180
town you go to there's a Python meetup

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,520
within a hundred miles

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,750
you can drive there in a couple Amina

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,610
might not be going in that day of course

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,620
but you can find contacts and say hey

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,570
you know I'm in town and I'd love to

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,280
show off the bus if it's possible for me

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,800
to get a shower so on and so on it's

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,740
very easy to travel the country through

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,320
the network of a Python and of course

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,890
Python to make all the systems go to do

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,480
what we need them to do Python you know

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,730
we have talked about how it can be used

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,890
as a glue we have a lot of glue in the

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,290
bus right but the bus is a really good

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,460
example of using Python for glue so

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,110
let's take a deep dive and you're just

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,400
one of the systems I thought probably

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,740
the one that most we wanted to hear

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,620
about what is our power system okay so

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,330
here you see our breaker boxes the one

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,650
on the right is AC power which we almost

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,740
never use and I'm not going to talk

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,450
about the device on the left is shunt

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,760
reader the device in the middle is what

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,670
I more want you to look at that is our

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,990
DC breaker and if you look at the lower

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,840
part of the picture you can see a really

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,520
big DC breaker that serves is

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,460
essentially an emergency shutoff that

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,050
red button there although we found it

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,570
was used in non-emergency situations

00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,950
often when the bomb Beno realized he

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,050
could like push things into it so it's a

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,930
little more obscure than it was in this

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,910
picture brief aside about volts and amps

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,170
for off-grid systems architecture I know

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,520
there's all kinds of metaphors about

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,570
power about volts and amps and maybe

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,670
some people are really familiar with

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,460
them some people aren't usually you'd

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,870
say something like amps are the total

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,100
amount of water flowing through the pipe

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,750
and volts of the amount of pressure

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,700
pushing the water through the pipe I

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,230
think for off-grid systems architecture

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,550
it's good to adopt a completely

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,370
different view which is that volts are a

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,930
compatibility layer if you have service

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,630
at 12

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,280
volts you're compatible with 12-volt

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,780
devices and so you need all the

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,600
compatibility layers for all the

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,669
voltages that you want to surf amps are

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,680
a rate of expenditure right as you're

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,780
using power you measure how much you're

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,550
using in amps right so now remember it

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,530
volts times amps or watts

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,150
we usually count watt hours which is

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,880
pretty typical sometimes we say wow is

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,810
for short and wires think of wires is a

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,639
currency right you're budgeting in wires

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,220
solar panels this is of course how we

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,770
get power from the Sun we adopted a

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,090
belief that it's useful to be able to

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,099
take the solar panels off the roof of

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,199
the bus put them somewhere in the Sun

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,970
and move the bus into the shade so we

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,830
opted for these flexible lightweight

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,070
panels and they're on about a 55 foot

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,259
run so I can if I can find the right

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,669
parking situation I can have the panel's

00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,770
in the Sun with the bus in the shade for

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,620
a few days and I think that's pretty

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,330
essential they're flexible so they curve

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:31,590
to meet the shape of the roof and we get

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,150
they're rated at 120 watts each that'd

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,770
be 700 total but we've never gotten

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,099
anything like that about 500 is where we

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,950
top out batteries we opted for lead acid

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,690
batteries we almost were able to make

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,110
lithium make sense but we went with lead

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,029
acid for a couple reasons one the

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,209
economics of it right now are still just

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,920
ahead and you know environmentally of

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,570
course lithium are much better but if

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,520
they're recycled let ask the batteries

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,620
are 100% recyclable if you you know

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,240
responsibly take care of them and - is

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,529
the road batteries on the bus the bus

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
that cranked the the batteries that

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,640
crank the engine are also LED acid so

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,260
having the same chemistry across both

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,700
means that we can unite the two systems

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,770
and use them to charge each other make

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,070
one big battery bank in situations where

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,600
we want to do that like for example if

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,740
the road batteries haven't been fully

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,150
charged in a while which on a big

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,970
vehicle you want to do and we've got

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,589
more than enough solar power we can open

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,029
the system and let some of that flow

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,029
into the road batteries which is pretty

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,200
cool alright so let's talk about volts

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,550
here's our battery config I just showed

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,709
you those four batteries here they are

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,050
six volts each okay we run each of these

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,490
pairs in series which gives us 12 volts

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,290
and then we run those in parallel

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,260
keeping it at 12 volts now imagine each

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,610
of these two banks are about a little

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,040
more than two and a half

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,050
kilowatt hours which means that the

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,190
burning of them parallel so we add those

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,180
together and we get a little more than

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,320
five kilowatt hours now let's visit the

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,730
inside of the bus remember I showed you

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,380
the breaker panel let's see what that

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,820
looks like okay so we have devices that

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,880
are connected to the breaker panel we

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,660
have our fridge our computers our lights

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,769
and so on all of these devices also I'm

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,810
not going to talk to you in depth about

00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,420
this but all of these devices in some

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,779
way we have like little custom bit bents

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,970
of Python for like the fridge the

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:18,630
Dometic 94 z it's Wi-Fi controllable

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,190
right so if the forecast calls for

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,550
clouds and the batteries are getting low

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,740
we can turn one of the two zones off and

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,010
so to save power right so those are some

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,959
of the ways that you budget the negative

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,970
side of all devices is connected to the

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,110
bus frame okay and then we've got the

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,730
battery system which I just showed you

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,290
on the last slide positive is connected

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,360
directly to the breaker panel the

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,390
negative is connected through a shunt to

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
the bus frame okay and that's gonna be

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,600
important when we talk about amps

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,730
remember that shunt we do also serve

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,769
other voltages some what we do 20 volts

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,769
for laptops deskah you know we have a

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:58,050
desktop computer like an all-in-one

00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:00,570
screens monitors and the bus USB C has a

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,130
20 volt option and we do 5 volts all

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,310
over the place 5 volts it's really

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,339
moving in to be one of the most popular

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,910
voltages for all kinds of small things

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,560
because you know it's USB so all our

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,610
lighting pretty much all our lighting

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,019
not all our lane but close to all our

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,060
lighting are all our LED strips our

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,209
Raspberry Pi or Wi-Fi BeagleBone black

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,949
all these things are all 5 volts we

00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,720
almost never turn on our inverter we

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:28,920
almost never take power that's in our

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,680
batteries and turn it into AC power mics

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,810
now inverter people will tell you that

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,750
their inverter is like 99% efficient and

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,310
I think that it can be but you're also

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,890
plugging in an AC adapter to the other

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,930
end of it so you're going from batteries

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,000
DC to AC through the inverter then back

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,470
to DC with the AC adapter and these AC

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,880
adapters that ship with your consumer

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,480
grade products are not meant for

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,520
off-grid use and are not you know even

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,810
if the inverter is 90% efficient which I

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,350
don't think it is the AC adapter is

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,750
going to take into

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,250
they're 10 or 20% off the top of that so

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,310
we only ever turn the inverter on when

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,860
we need to actually run an AC motor

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:08,430
blender coffee grinder juicer for a few

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,110
minutes at a time that's it okay now

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,270
let's talk about amps okay now we talked

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,910
about that that shunt that the negative

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,070
side of the battery connects to the

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,440
frame through here's the battery system

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,150
here's a shunt number one for all our

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,590
devices shut number two we call our

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,560
petrol charge shunt so that's going to

00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,970
connect to the either our plug in

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,910
battery charger if we're plugged in in

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,470
charge the batteries or alternator power

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,180
okay so you can see the arrow for number

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,440
one is going toward the devices the

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,510
error for number two is going toward the

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,770
battery system shot number three which

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,870
is what we hope all the power always

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,590
goes through if we have enough Sun is

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,970
the for the solar system and here's an

00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,260
actual picture of it I figured this

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,280
picture was a little harder to explain

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,510
that's why I made the diagram but you

00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,550
can see the four batteries in the back

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,160
the shunts they're in the middle that's

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,960
a charge controller on the right there's

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,400
a closer a picture of the three shunts

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,270
that's what they look like those three

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,510
brass things

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:03,510
okay so shunts let you read how many

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,390
amps are going through the system at

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:10,050
that point okay we wrote a project

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:13,350
called stray electrons to do all that

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,720
stuff so what it does it reads the

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,160
shunts about 15 times every second and

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,620
you have to read them rapidly because

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,970
some devices might have a lot of use but

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,580
only for half a second if you missed

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,310
that you won't even have be measuring

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,740
that power draw then every two seconds

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,690
we take mean average of a mean amperage

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,910
we take the average amperage we push

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,650
that via MQTT to all the listeners in

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,120
the bus so we have a big pub/sub system

00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,490
across the internal network of the bus

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,950
so home assists in all of our little

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,450
displays and stuff all listen and every

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,200
two seconds they get an updated how much

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,610
power we're using

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,140
we recorded an influx DB and oh yeah

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,150
recorded an influx TV that's essentially

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,040
what stray electrons does and that runs

00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,210
on our Raspberry Pi which of course is

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,370
right between the hemp seeds and the

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,190
sriracha where else would you put a

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,450
Raspberry Pi our Raspberry Pi works

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,940
really hard it does power management

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,920
which is what I'm describing now but it

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,410
also is a quick aside it's our internet

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,420
gateway controls all the lights on the

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,250
bus are

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,329
all the lights on the bus it runs home

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,880
assistant you know it's the home

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:17,600
assistant server it runs our influx DB

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,519
instance and it runs grow fauna okay so

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,040
here is what we mostly do with Griffin

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,800
ax this is our power consumption green

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,600
is solar brown is petrol charge

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,660
red is consumption in the yellow is

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,010
voltage okay so you can see the voltage

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,750
going up there when we started the

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,889
engine later in the day because we

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,529
weren't getting enough solar I guess

00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:39,350
that day so obviously that was not an

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:42,019
off-grid day and again we did have 71

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,269
consecutive off-grid days here is a more

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:46,220
typical day right Sun comes up and we

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:49,070
get really nice Sun and then slowly it

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,269
gets we get lesson you know fewer and

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,699
fewer amps from it throughout the day

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,930
and you can see the voltage climbing so

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,190
the voltage you say it's a 12-volt

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,070
system but it's really like between

00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,720
eleven point eight and fourteen when you

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,850
have a 12 volt system depending on how

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,040
much current depending on how much

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,240
charge the batteries have anybody want

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,269
to guess with those little pillars of

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,649
red our fridge you know it that's the

00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,060
refrigerator kicking out wow that was

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,380
fast

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,420
yep so there's the refrigerator kicking

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,310
on and it's a two zone fridge so you can

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,660
see they happen not quite in pairs but

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,610
often they happen kind of closely it's

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,649
close to in pairs here you can see I put

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,630
a little purple snow cap on the top and

00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,890
that is for battery inefficiency the

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,570
batteries are only eighty percent

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,699
efficient so when we're not powered by

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,750
solar when we're drawing only off the

00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,339
batteries

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,810
that's reflects that we're only getting

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:35,300
eighty percent efficiency

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,430
here's Fibonacci showing the whole thing

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:45,920
- Harry first of all it's a mic on last

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:47,360
year being in a national forest far away

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,220
from stuff but you know with other

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,290
people camping usually far away from

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,550
power and feeling secure knowing that

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,230
you have everything that you need to

00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,089
work talk to your friends on the

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,529
internet to continue your personal

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,850
growth journey that we all have by doing

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,360
research that we do every day on

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,709
whatever topics on the internet having

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,930
secured you know dry food and

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:11,149
refrigerated food is an incredible

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,329
feeling an incredible feeling it's

00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:17,660
wonderful to feel occasionally like you

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:20,360
are a whole organism rather than always

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,540
needing to be a part of the grid in

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,550
order to be whole

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,829
but that's not the greatest thing Python

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,839
is done for me there's two other things

00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,579
I want to talk about one is it gave me a

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,930
sink for my work I never realized how

00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,459
important this was gonna be but if you

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,100
are thinking about doing the tiny house

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:38,279
or School Bus thing one of the greatest

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,779
benefits that you will reap is that even

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,370
if maybe you're a contractor that's what

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,690
I was doing through almost this even if

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,970
you don't have an active client at that

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,889
moment you have an infinite sink for

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,389
your work that will pay dividends in

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,190
terms of bettering your life down the

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,300
road that's a really hard thing to

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,040
achieve unless you can afford real

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,569
estate or whatever but that that was

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,709
something I didn't fully realize and the

00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,970
most important thing is it took me

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,100
around the country to see how much we

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,130
all have in common with one another we

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,490
all want peace we all want justice we

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:08,880
all want freedom and meeting people in

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:11,189
the deep south in Alabama and of course

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,100
in the West Coast and seeing all that we

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,250
have in common with one another was

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,169
deeply inspiring and I don't think it

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:25,530
was really possible to do that only a

00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:28,620
decade ago and it gives me hope that if

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:31,470
more if more simple basic off-grid tech

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:35,940
is built that it will enable more people

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,830
to see how much we have in common now

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,360
just a really quick song and then we'll

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,460
do questions another thing that we have

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,830
in common is that we all use the same

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:51,780
basic vowel sounds to communicate will

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,190
you go a universal sounds of the

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,260
universe you can hear them even more

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,349
clearly if I say it like this

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,349
[Music]

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:11,520
all right thanks questions oh and by the

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,320
way they don't need to be questions I'm

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
not a big I'm not a big advocate of they

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,680
always form your question in the form of

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,720
a question if you have just want to come

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,720
at me that to you is fine

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:30,630
down at the pike on in in out on the

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,830
west coast in Portland Portland it was

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,930
wonderful but I have a difficult

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:43,110
question for you all right and I'll I'll

00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:47,690
sum it up in one word toast yeah we

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:50,580
don't do toast so we don't cook with

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,560
electric a cook with propane that's the

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,300
one thing we do with propane you can get

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,830
a propane toaster but mass so we do

00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,110
toast either on an iron skillet which

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,790
doesn't quite count yeah toast

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,430
there's no way no perfect way to do

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,590
toast that I'm aware of off-grid you're

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,280
not the first person to use that one

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,690
word either that's an interesting thing

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,030
leave time for a couple more yep

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:16,170
did I see early on that you said you

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:18,480
stopped yes there was like it was it did

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,860
you end to the drinks oh yeah so I live

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,380
in a house in Portland now back in the

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,030
real world by the way living in a school

00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,120
bus causes you to move to Portland and

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,330
think you're living in the real world so

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,300
my question is why why stop yeah it's

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,440
really just sort of external logistical

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,500
stuff I started working full-time

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,450
although still remotely we just kind of

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,650
wanted to live in a house just to change

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,910
it up and live in a house and again we

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,740
have a blessed we have the privilege to

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,240
be able to make that choice I think

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,640
we'll probably do the bus again in fact

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,740
I was even thinking maybe to bring it

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,510
next year to Cleveland Kirin crash who I

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,620
believe is either he's certainly at the

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,740
conference somewhere he's in the back

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,900
there he bought a bus so maybe if people

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,550
are into it we can ask the PSF or

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,440
whomever if we can drive the buses into

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,170
those big cargo bay doors over there and

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,399
do a bus tutorial in side pike on might

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,529
be kind of cool that'd be fun right

00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,450
all right so help me encourage that ya

00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,309
know real good it wasn't like we got to

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,719
the point where something broke or

00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,849
anything like that you know we just kind

00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,769
of wanted to you know it was like more

00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,629
than a year and a half we learned a lot

00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:23,210
we wanted to regroup recharge and I

00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:26,629
think we'll probably do it again yeah

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,200
hey I was just curious what's your

00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:32,749
background educational background and to

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,479
be considered like alternative fuels for

00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:37,940
the bus yeah both well I don't know if

00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:40,009
the first one is just about me but I'm

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,839
happy to tell ya my backer I have a

00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:46,549
degree in political science from SUNY

00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:49,879
New Paltz we have considered alternate

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:51,619
fuel yeah it's just that when we were so

00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:53,330
now I'd probably be more likely to

00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,889
consider it right now the lowest hanging

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,200
fruit was clearly solar because diesel

00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:59,179
was cheap but as diesel gets more

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,119
expensive it makes more sense versus

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,710
solar to consider alternate fuels people

00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,259
have done biodiesel with the

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,200
International 3800 T for 44 e in fact I

00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:11,719
think they've done it with my exact bus

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,039
and so you know it's it's definitely

00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,719
cool idea I'd like to go all the way to

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,759
veggie oil even and do that you know

00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:18,710
self refining and stuff but yeah you

00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,210
know of course you know diesel hacking

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,309
and alternative fuels go hand in hand

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,899
but again the reason we didn't do it was

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,429
because it made more sense dollar for

00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,929
dollar or we were able to we were able

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,489
to lower our carbon footprint more

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,940
quickly with solar than we were with an

00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:34,279
alternate fuel the only other question I

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,139
had was have you gone over to the Rock

00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:39,259
and Roll Hall of Fame there's a very

00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:41,599
famous bus over there I have now but yes

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,629
I will have to convince these original

00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,769
bus so I'd recommend seeing I didn't

00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:46,999
somehow I didn't even know that it's

00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:48,589
across the street I didn't know that

00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:51,469
we'll have to go see it yeah thank you

00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:53,599
so I just spent a month in an RV that we

00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:55,249
fixed up yeah one of the things that we

00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,219
went with an RV instead of the bus was

00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:59,509
it was too darn hot we had to have an

00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:01,849
air conditioner how to run a generator

00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:04,429
it sucked when you were you know but we

00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:05,809
could spend four days off-grid with a

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:07,759
generator which is not really off-grid

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,799
yeah how did you handle it

00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,719
so elastomeric coating on the top is

00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,129
really good it's white stuff that you

00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:14,749
pour supposedly it's environmentally

00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,089
friendly you pour it on and it takes

00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,739
like five days to dry that reduce the

00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:20,870
temperature inside the bus by like 20

00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:23,750
degrees from from like 95

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:26,690
I've 275 or a hundred and plus 280 plus

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,270
so that's a big part of it what was the

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,679
name again it's just elastomeric coating

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,330
the brand we use with snow roof but I

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,799
think they're all about the same the

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,210
other thing that's nice about a school

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,590
boss in particular is it has when it's

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,909
very easy to create cross ventilation

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,320
because of the placement of the windows

00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:41,450
we kept all the original windows of the

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,929
bus so you know you can lower a window

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,490
and put a DC fan in there we were we had

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,600
days when it was uncomfortable but if we

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,090
were parked in the shade we were always

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,010
fine but that's not easy in some parts

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,690
of the country to find to find shade and

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,039
again if you do want to park in the

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,580
shade which is nice I think it's

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,169
probably better for the bus - then you

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,120
have to have a way to get the your

00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:05,870
panels in the Sun you know so that's a

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,010
trade-off there - yeah I we we had a few

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,649
days when we were too hot but we were

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,820
mostly mostly pretty ok the main way

00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,500
that we did temperature control was

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,049
latitude if it was too hot we drove

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,020
north it was too cold we drive south if

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:20,570
you have that luxury so how did you

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,950
connect to the internet yeah good

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,360
question I need that I brought this

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,340
slide up because I knew these were gonna

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,750
be question prompts yeah I think we've

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,380
only got not very much time so I'll go

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,860
through real quickly oh we still got

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,049
three minutes awesome ok yeah so big

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,450
externally mounted Wi-Fi antenna where

00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,770
we can get Wi-Fi from about I think the

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,779
farthest we've ever got it is about

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,850
three miles which and you can go further

00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:45,770
than that right people do people people

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,529
do Wi-Fi for miles and miles with the

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,419
right gear so then generally we want to

00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,350
connect to Wi-Fi so we'd connect to

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:53,539
Wi-Fi then we have a much smaller

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,850
externally mounted Wi-Fi antenna that

00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:57,440
provides local service to people who

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:01,429
happen to be camping around the bus and

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,279
then inside the bus we have both a Wi-Fi

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,409
and wired network so what we like to do

00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,940
is connect via Wi-Fi and then use our

00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:10,039
own gateway our Raspberry Pi is what we

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,590
use as a gateway and then redistribute

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:15,020
connectivity failing that we do almost

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,270
the exact same configuration but instead

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,570
of a instead of using the external

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:23,059
amount of Wi-Fi gear we use I have both

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,250
a gsm and cdma hotspot so depending on

00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,630
where we were in the country we'd just

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,030
connect one of those hotspots but then

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,620
we then we'd lock down the Wi-Fi because

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,120
you know you can't just be providing

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,560
hotspot Wi-Fi to a whole campground

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,720
right sadly

00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,000
all right thanks but I'd love to be

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,100
driving through you know I'd love to be

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,630
driving through failover nodes on a mesh

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,840
network all throughout the country if we

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:50,220
can get that going that'd be a good

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,220
other questions any other questions

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:58,210
thank you so much you in that stuff

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,210
