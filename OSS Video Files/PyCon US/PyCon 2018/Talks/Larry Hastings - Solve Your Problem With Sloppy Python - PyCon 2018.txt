Title: Larry Hastings - Solve Your Problem With Sloppy Python - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: Larry Hastings

Stop writing crappy shell scriptsâ€”write crappy Python scripts instead!

Other talks will show you how to write clean, performant, robust Python.  But that's not always necessary.  When writing personal automation or solving one-shot problems, it can be safe (and fun!) to quickly hack something together.

This talk will show examples of problems suitable for this approach, scenarios where it's reasonable to cut corners, novel techniques that can help break a problem down, and shortcuts that can speed development.
