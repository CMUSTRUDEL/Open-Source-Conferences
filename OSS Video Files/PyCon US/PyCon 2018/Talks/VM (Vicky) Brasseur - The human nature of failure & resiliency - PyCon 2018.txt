Title: VM (Vicky) Brasseur - The human nature of failure & resiliency - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: VM (Vicky) Brasseur

Projects fail in droves. Systems hiccup and hours of downtime follows. Screws fall out all the time; the world is an imperfect place.

We talk a lot about building resilient systems, but all systems are (at least for now) built by humans. Humans who have been making the same types of mistakes for thousands of years. 

Just because failure happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your system. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential.

This talk distills 3000 pages of failure research into 40 minutes of knowledge about the human factors of failure, how it can be recognised, and how you can work around it to create more resilient systems.

By the end of this talk the audience will have an awareness of the most common psychological reasons for mistakes and failures and how to develop systems and processes to protect against them.

welcome today's talk is the human nature

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:14,060
of failure and resiliency by vm please

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,310
give her a warm welcome

00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,310
[Applause]

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,330
Hey hi oh my gosh the microphone is on

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,939
umm hey everyone I have a lot to cover

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,289
so we're just going to dive right in Who

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,300
am I why am I here

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,590
my name is VM brewer but because we're

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,510
all friends here you can call me Vicky

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,540
plus the virtual machine jokes have

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,030
gotten old please don't think yours is

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,910
original because it's not I'm the author

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,829
of this which is as far as we can tell

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,280
the very first book on how to contribute

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,079
to free and open-source software I am an

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,070
authoring community moderator for open

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,079
source com

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,230
the vice-president of the open source

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,680
initiative I'm an open source policy and

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,190
strategy freelancer and I do training on

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,899
how to do this sort of stuff right here

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,519
but before I did all of this I used to

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,260
lead software engineering departments

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,210
and while I was doing that I started

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,710
studying failure as a bit of a hobby I

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,259
did a lot of research into failure this

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,380
is a link to a bibliography of all that

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,450
research currently there are 205 items

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,850
in this bibliography it adds up to

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,220
approximately 3,500 pages worth the

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,259
breacher research into failure

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,450
now this talk is going to take all of

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,369
that and give you the greatest hits the

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,130
things that are common across all those

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,180
3,500 pages of research into failure I'm

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,729
gonna give it to you today in

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,439
approximately 40 minutes here they are

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,270
here's a quick summary these are the

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,590
themes that are common across all of

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,720
that research and what I'm going to

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,850
share with you today like I said there

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,439
are thousands of pages here I'm not

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,119
going to get into everything um I'm also

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,189
not going to give you the secret serum

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,170
that will prevent failure for you from

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,810
here on out I'm just not going to do it

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,090
because it's not possible I will however

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,460
give you a list of questions of things

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,670
you should consider when you want to

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,899
start succeeding with failure I am only

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,830
going to give you an overview again

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,130
because dude 3,500 pages what the hell

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,960
so um there will hopefully be time for

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,820
questions if not now there is a break

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,320
afterwards so catch me after wait and we

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,290
can talk about failure it's absolutely

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,630
fascinating so another thing I need to

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,620
mention has a limitation of this talk it

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,150
does go into a lot of psychology and

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,040
what I have found is most of the

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,980
research almost all of the research is

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,980
done in a Western mindset using Western

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,770
psychology on Western individuals and

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,350
unrelated recent studies have shown that

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,380
a lot of these psychological concepts

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:51,890
that we in Western cultures believe are

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,890
solid truths don't actually hold true as

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:59,450
well for Europe for Eastern Asian

00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:03,200
African cultures so just be aware there

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,580
is a bias here for Western minds and

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,900
finally do save questions for the end

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,340
which is something I really don't have

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,350
to say at PyCon but I include this slide

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,430
anyway so let's get into those common

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,580
themes and we're going to start with

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,630
complexity the world is complex this

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,810
shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,310
people are complex he'll be complexity

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,830
hiding in something as simple as

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,700
chocolate chip cookies is really quite

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,830
mind-blowing we as humans however we

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,410
don't like complexity and that leads us

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,720
to some very unfortunate tendencies for

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,200
starters we have a tendency to ignore

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,780
complexity completely lalalalala nothing

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,239
to see here moving on everything around

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,239
us is constantly changing constantly

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,160
evolving yet research shows we prefer to

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,989
operate as though we are in a static

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,230
environment we will start a project

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,540
we'll take a snapshot in our brain of

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,430
how things are right then and then we'll

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,239
operate within the snapshot while the

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,040
rest of the world moves on without us as

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,850
you can imagine this can lead to some

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,220
problems research also shows that we

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,830
dislike variation we like things to be

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,890
just so and we like them to stay that

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,260
way hence that snapshot we also prefer

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,480
to operate in serial rather than

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,300
parallel because that minimizes

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,250
complexity and it allows us to focus our

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,870
efforts on what we then consider to be

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,180
the best

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,669
so we focus on these static now rather

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:37,699
than the ever-changing complexity of the

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:39,620
future and the parallel projects so we

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,349
can't know everything and we like to

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,060
think we do but we really can't and

00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,580
because we're more comfortable with what

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,430
we know we avoid everything we don't and

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,469
this this is a problem we don't actually

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,599
know as much as we think we know we are

00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:58,430
each and every one of us a walking

00:04:53,599 --> 00:05:01,189
talking dunning-kruger Film Festival so

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,409
we don't know we think we know more than

00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:05,870
we do and because of that we have a

00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:08,539
tendency to overlook a lot of things and

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,060
these are the unknown unknowns and

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:13,250
rather than just some silly thing a

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,250
politician said once this is actually a

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,960
real psychological concept it's a latent

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,259
error

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,909
Leyton errors are overlooked near-misses

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,310
layton errors look an awful lot like

00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:28,639
successes because they haven't failed

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,319
yet and that's because latent errors

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,169
have yet to meet their enabling

00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,839
condition a an enabling condition is

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:39,710
that trigger that turns a latent error

00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,930
to the dark side of failure so there is

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,919
a very good example I like to use for

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,629
latent errors meeting their enabling

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,830
conditions now I won't be able to see

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:50,110
when you raise your hand but I'm going

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,719
to ask you to raise your hands anyway

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,349
how many of you out there remember the

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:59,899
Deepwater Horizon tragedy that happened

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,349
a few years ago yeah oil rig in the Gulf

00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:07,279
of Mexico went boom bad thing so what

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:08,839
happened there was you had to latent

00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,919
errors really there was a lot going on

00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,289
but we're going to minimize things

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,089
because again not going into detail we

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,339
had to latent errors you had somebody

00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:18,500
performing a cementing procedure and

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:21,259
that cementing procedure was filling a

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,949
pipe with cement and while he was doing

00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:26,629
so he was doing it wrong normally that's

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,979
fine that's perfectly fine he was doing

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,990
it the way that they always do it and

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:31,939
there was never a problem but he was

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,879
doing it wrong and because of that gas

00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:36,589
was escaping from the pipe that's latent

00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,750
error number one incorrect cementing

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:42,960
procedure latent error number two

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,340
somebody was welding nearby usually not

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,040
a problem you can have these things in

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,750
close proximity all the time and it's in

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,330
the oil rig right someone's always

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,360
cementing and someone is always welding

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,940
not a problem okay so two Layton errors

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,770
and then we have our enabling condition

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,350
something that does not happen very

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,520
often especially not on the high seas

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:08,580
and that is it was a windless day so

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,250
thanks to that windless day that welding

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,090
that spark caught the gas there was an

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,460
explosion it killed 11 people 16 others

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,980
were critically injured very very bad

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,630
and we had the worst environmental

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,200
disaster our country has ever seen

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:30,480
because of latent errors meeting their

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:34,290
enabling condition now it is possible to

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,760
spot latent errors you can look for them

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,430
in your post mortems do you do post

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,050
mortems you probably should as you're

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,850
doing that as you're looking at your

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,460
post mortem and you're looking at how

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,800
things went ask the group so what

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,169
wouldn't right we've been looking at

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,330
what went wrong but what went right

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,070
pretty much by chance those are probably

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,660
your latent errors and things you should

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,940
consider for your next project but

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,610
here's the problem we're really bad at

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:04,020
post mortems we just don't know how to

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:07,950
do them so we focus on symptoms rather

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,620
than causes when we do look for causes

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,290
we look for just one we look for root

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,150
cause I'm sorry folks gonna tear down

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,200
your little house of cards here there is

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:22,290
never just one root root cause we also

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,790
have selection bias we prefer to look at

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,290
the easy things the things we can

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,290
actually answer very quickly because it

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,500
makes us feel accomplished another form

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,570
of selection bias that we have is that

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,349
we only post-mortem the things that went

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,760
wrong rather than the things that went

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,080
right as well if you post-mortem the

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,030
things that went right you're more

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,740
likely to spot those latent errors that

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,350
never met they're enabling conditions

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,760
but we don't do that for us post mortems

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,430
are things that you only do when

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,770
goes wrong so what do we do

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,260
how can we minimize these tendencies we

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,080
have with just avoiding complexity

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,750
well for starters Dupree mortems before

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,880
you even start your project do a

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,610
pre-mortem rather than a post-mortem and

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,130
start looking for things that might go

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,500
wrong start looking for latent errors

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,980
come up with contingency plans for all

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,020
of them

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,700
get skeptics in the room who will

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,959
question all of your assumptions we'll

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,260
talk a lot more about that in a moment

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,160
and then make your plan in your

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,250
pre-mortem

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,630
but then plan to change the plan because

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,970
if you remember you take that snapshot

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,089
right and we like to work inside the

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,810
snapshot once in a while

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:40,260
plan to pause bring your snapshot into

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,760
modern times and take it again and once

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,600
you take that new snapshot you might

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:51,320
have to adjust your project accordingly

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:54,209
now let's dive into assumptions man

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,209
nearly every single piece of research in

00:09:54,209 --> 00:10:00,029
that bibliography has terrible things to

00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,620
say about assumptions this is when those

00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,720
lessons we never seem to learn for some

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,339
reason we always assume when we always

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,440
assume we're assuming and they were okay

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,940
with assuming we assume research has

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
nothing nice to say about assumptions

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,540
all for starters assumptions are usually

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,000
based on incorrect and invalid

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,000
information we often base them on those

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,040
snapshots we take in our brain and those

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,200
snapshots again they're static

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,029
whereas the world has moved on so our

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,089
snapshots are wrong our assumptions are

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,490
wrong we then use those assumptions as a

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,920
basis for a set of heuristics which we

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,829
apply to real-world situations right now

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,020
and that's not going to work how many of

00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:43,230
you have tried to estimate how long it's

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,240
going to take to complete a project how

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,890
many of you are actually right probably

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,540
none of you if I could see your hands

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,779
and you were you had them still up you

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,850
would be liars every one of you um other

00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,529
really popular assumptions that we make

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,730
in technology that we probably should

00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:01,860
stop doing user needs what is our user

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,660
actually trying to accomplish we think

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,420
we know but we really don't

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,350
and yet we assume we move on and we

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,380
develop things

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,390
what business are we really in this is

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,970
something startups never seem to answer

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:18,290
and they keep failing because of it they

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,050
don't know why they're in business

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:25,050
assumptions usually are based upon a

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,470
poor problem definition we are so bad at

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,450
this

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,470
I am a freelancer now I work with

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,270
companies to help them with their

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,440
open-source strategy and compliance and

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,360
all that sort of stuff and they come to

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,240
me and they say Viki we want to do

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,070
open-source and I say great I want to

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,350
help you do open-source why do you want

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,240
to do it what do you want to get out of

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,910
it what problem are you looking to solve

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,800
for your business and almost entirely

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,870
except for one client I'm working with

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,430
right now who is so amazing they don't

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,830
have an answer they don't know why they

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,230
want to do this and this is common we

00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,850
never really know why we're doing stuff

00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,710
we have a problem we're looking to solve

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,110
but we haven't defined that problem and

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,890
so we're basing our assumption on the

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:06,690
problem that is not defined and so if we

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,100
haven't defined our problem and we're

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,650
basing our assumptions on an undefined

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,150
problem we're basing our solutions on an

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,530
undefined problem and we're naturally

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,750
going to fail because we're doing the

00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,940
wrong thing it is absolutely impossible

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,550
in technology to fail fast if you don't

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,080
define success you must know what you're

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,540
trying to accomplish because if you

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,480
don't to find success you can't define

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,420
failure you can't fail fast if you don't

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,100
know what failure even is now we in tech

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,110
like to say that we don't have time for

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,200
that holy crap

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,630
no we are totally agile we are just

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,060
iterative and it's great you know we're

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,670
gonna just build and move fast and

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,250
break stuff and it's amazing but the

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,610
thing is we don't really have the time

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,170
to do that but we don't have time to

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,170
check the assumptions we have the time

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,080
to do that and to build the wrong thing

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,190
for the wrong person then scrap it

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,720
because we don't check our assumptions

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:05,670
it's terrible so you do have to question

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,950
your assumptions as you are doing this

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,050
entire process always question them and

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,090
that's because psychologists have found

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,130
over and over again that unquestioned

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,080
assumptions become facts in the minds of

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,940
the hearers we have all seen this in

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,560
play when you're sitting there in a

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,410
meeting and the person at the top of the

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,480
desk

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,430
top of the table there says so how long

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,870
is it going to take to do this someone

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,480
else at the table raises their hand they

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,899
say we assume this will take two weeks

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,569
but we need to confirm research shows

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:36,040
that for almost everyone in that room

00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:38,170
especially the person at the head of the

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,740
table they don't hear anything after two

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:45,100
weeks it's it's just a psychological

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,339
thing we don't hear and it needs to we

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,060
need to confirm so this is really common

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:54,069
in all cultures across all industries

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:59,470
but we in technology seem to get bitten

00:13:54,069 --> 00:14:01,089
by it a lot so assumptions they're

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,800
horrible they're terrible they are in

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,269
fact the root of all evil they're not

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,819
the next one is actually the root of all

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:10,949
evil what do we do to minimize the

00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:13,870
impact well please define your problem

00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:16,060
please not only define your problem but

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,230
communicates the definition of the

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,730
problem because otherwise you will be

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,759
sitting in that room with all those

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,670
people and you'll ask them what are we

00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,410
trying to accomplish if each and every

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,839
person in that room does not have the

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,860
exact same answer then you still have

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,610
assumptions that you need to fix and

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,279
communication that you need to fix as

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:39,160
well

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,540
Duprey mortems lists and verify not only

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,970
those latent errors don't just look for

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,939
those but explicitly call out every

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,740
single assumption that you are making be

00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:49,839
very obvious about it it's great to have

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,870
assumptions they're shortcuts they allow

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,720
us to move more quickly but be aware of

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,420
your assumptions and once you have those

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,730
write them down and you need to do this

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,759
because you later need to go back and

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,350
revisit them throughout the process just

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,269
check in every once in a while and those

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,860
assumptions because again you're working

00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,620
in your snapshot you need to update your

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,420
snapshot to the now and when you're

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,160
updating your snapshot to the now also

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,800
go through all of your assumptions

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,019
because some of them might no longer be

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,329
assumptions now you might have knowledge

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:26,550
rather than an assumption but you're not

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:29,939
gonna know that if you don't verify and

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,630
this actually is the root of all evil

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:35,540
businesses clubs projects any

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,240
group of human beings every piece of

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:43,280
research shows that human beings are the

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,050
primary cause of failure surprising huh

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,300
but we can't exactly get rid of them I

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,460
highly recommend you do not get rid of

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:55,040
human beings so that is not the solution

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:59,090
here we are kind of a problematic

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,880
species we are fairly arrogant as the

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,800
top of the food chain we like to think

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Ellen Langer is a psychologist at

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,210
Harvard she was the first person to to

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,960
publish a paper on this

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:14,630
it's called illusion of control we as

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,450
humans again arrogant we like to think

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,880
we have a lot of control over things and

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,760
we don't we overestimate the impact our

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,920
actions can have and we overestimate

00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,800
even what we can just influence let

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,620
alone control and because of that we

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,130
ignore latent errors because we think we

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,950
are in control again near misses

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,750
remember deepwater horizon now if we

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,450
look for latent errors if we're not

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,700
actively ignoring them we can do

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,280
something about latent errors we can

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,950
stop that man from doing his cementing

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,050
procedure incorrectly we can stop that

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,790
man from doing the welding we can

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,480
control these two things because we can

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:59,630
see them and go that's not gonna go well

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,030
and we can control that but what we can

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:05,209
never do is we can never make the wind

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:07,430
blow we can never control enabling

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,819
conditions and therefore we can never

00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:13,339
control fully any situation wherein we

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:17,839
can think we can but we're wrong we just

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:20,209
can't do it so how is your team

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,790
organized your team your project your

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,250
company hell is it actually physically

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,170
structured and organized you know what's

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,020
your hierarchy and all that goodness

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,730
because that organization can have a

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,670
really dramatic effect on the its

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:38,120
success rate and on its reaction to

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:40,430
failures are you in silos are you in

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,670
organizational silos who here knows what

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,320
I mean by organizational silo hey not

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,430
quite everyone the other people are

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,180
probably just doing Twitter

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:54,740
but um so organizational silos you've

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,150
got this team here team C B and a and

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,790
they're all working on their own little

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,310
things very happily going along but

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,440
they're not communicating nobody really

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,630
knows what anyone else is doing and this

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,150
is a problem it dilutes responsibility

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,030
for failure let's say something goes

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,060
wrong over here in team a there's a

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,710
failure in team a and it could possibly

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,600
affect teams B and C but there's no

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,220
communication they don't tell them that

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,440
so teams B and C are gonna fail as well

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,100
because nobody has shared information

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,620
with them silos hamper communication

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,750
they obscure information and they're a

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,420
problem and they increased failures

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,670
within an organization another problem

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:39,050
is when your team is organized around

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:41,240
processes and let's say you've got one

00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,220
team that's dedicated 100% to testing

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,380
and this team is writing that team is

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,890
designing and this team is you know

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:52,190
deploying their all-around processes now

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:55,460
what happens if the process is what's

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,800
causing the failure what do you do that

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,810
well studies show that we as human

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,360
beings are less likely to change the

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,040
process because it also might mean we

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,040
have to change the organizational

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,900
structure in some way and so we don't do

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,240
it and we continue using broken

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,730
processes because of it and that leads

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,330
to a lot more failures

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,520
now both with silos and with with these

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,850
process organize things it does require

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,800
a reorg Anora to fix unfortunately and

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,590
those are we probably all know reorg

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,200
have never fun but it will help reduce

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,600
failures if you have multidisciplinary

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,180
teams because you get a lot more

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,300
communication across teams if you have

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,550
people who cross procedural boundaries

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,350
within a team and you get a lot more

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,700
people who are asking questions and

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,700
questioning assumptions

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,870
so regardless of the structure of your

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,880
team your group your project whatever it

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,789
is regardless of their structure how

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,610
does it react when something fails does

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:03,200
it punish people for failures this is

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,590
pretty common for people to be punished

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,000
for failures if that happens it's

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,150
actually a bigger problem than the

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,299
failure itself because it increases the

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,160
the impact of the failure that's because

00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:18,919
if people are afraid of being punished

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,179
for failure they stop reporting failures

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:25,400
and if people stop reporting failures it

00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,799
is impossible for you to learn from

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,990
failures because that is the only way to

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:35,360
prevent failures is to have failures and

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:38,030
learn from them unshared failures are

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,159
just the experience of an individual and

00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:43,880
that's it and I can stand right here on

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,590
this kind of squeaky podium thing I can

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,760
stand right here and I can gain

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,740
experience it just happens to me now if

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,500
I want to learn from that experience it

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,720
takes an extra step that's an activity

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,820
that's something I have to manually do

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,010
the experience comes at me for free

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,260
whether I like it or not it's my choice

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,600
whether I learned from it and for

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,450
failure it's the same thing we can't

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,970
learn from failures if we don't share

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:16,280
them you don't have the information to

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:18,890
share bigger problem or another problem

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,380
with people being afraid of punishment

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:25,159
for failure is that they stop innovating

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:28,000
they stop trying new things and I'm not

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,710
just talking like that Silicon Valley

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,600
disrupting sort of innovation I'm not

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,309
talking about that talking about the

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,650
kind of innovation that actually matters

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:39,200
the innovation of streamlining a

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,830
workflow the innovation of trying a new

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,650
library just small everyday innovations

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,020
that add up to a great deal of

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,880
improvement in your life we stop doing

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,760
it because we're afraid we're going to

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,570
get punished should it fail so that's a

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,540
big problem I've had people say don't

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,740
worry we don't have that problem I never

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,740
hear about failures at all

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,340
really did you just hear what I said

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,110
people oh yeah if you're not hearing

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,480
about it doesn't mean it's not happening

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:15,100
just means they're hidden and that's

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,100
worse than not having failures at all

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:24,380
another common problem with humans and

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,470
also I might I add my favorite cognitive

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,870
bias I do as a matter of fact have a

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,690
favorite cognitive bias normalization of

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,120
deviance Diane Vaughan is an American

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,980
sociologist she studied the space

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,200
shuttle Challenger explosion and she is

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,590
the first person to write about the

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,440
normalization of deviance yeah Diane so

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,540
normalized a getting difficult to speak

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,050
up here normalization of deviance is

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:53,540
when you have a latent error lying right

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,790
there in the open and rather than

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,670
picking it up and putting it away you

00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,550
just step over it you just avoid it you

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,680
know you just completely ignore lalala

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,020
there is no latent error there all right

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,080
this is a big problem an example I like

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,070
to give of normalized deviance is when

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,230
let's say you were a new programmer at a

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,370
company your talen log files as one is

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,930
want to do and you're looking at log

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,880
files and this error keeps popping up

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,650
and you're like holy what is this

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,750
error OMG and you run to the senior

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,660
developer and you're like hey what's

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,770
this error and they say don't worry

00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:33,110
happens all the time we just ignore it

00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,730
um hey as somebody who used to run

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,960
software engineering departments I'm

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,490
gonna tell you to get that out of

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,540
the log because it's noise that's

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,880
blocking my signal

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,950
so okay that's problem number one but if

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,730
it's an actual legitimate problem if

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,920
that error in your log is legit then I'm

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,830
sorry you are one race condition away

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,390
from catastrophe that's a latent error

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,660
that you are ignoring you have

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,010
normalized that deviance

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,690
so normalization of deviance we do it

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:05,960
all the time we are very familiar with

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:08,000
pressure and stress in technology we

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,430
have this unfortunate tendency across

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,390
all of humanity but particularly in

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,350
technology also medical we do a lot of

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,780
this

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:20,180
we push ourselves too hard we try doing

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,820
too much in too little time usually for

00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,710
no good purpose at all and this leads to

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,370
a lot of problem the obvious problems

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:30,620
are fatigue driven errors read the

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,260
studies in the bibliography about the

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:36,140
impact of this on your healthcare and

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,780
you will this is real this is a big

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,030
problem but it also is a problem because

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,060
but when we're fatigued when we're tired

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:47,660
when we're stressed out we have a

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:50,270
tendency research shows to rely more on

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,340
untested assumptions we will make

00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,560
wild-ass guesses and run with them and

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,180
that's perfectly fine we think is cool

00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,490
it's ok I'm totally stressed I've got

00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,720
 to do I've just got to move on but

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:08,210
it's a problem and it leads to a lot

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:09,860
more failures so remember when I

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,510
mentioned that we like to focus on just

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,910
that one thing we're working in serial

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,370
rather than parallel right we also have

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:20,300
a really hard time not seeing that one

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:21,920
thing through to the end which is a big

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,440
problem if we haven't bothered to define

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,330
what the end is frankly so we're just

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,130
going to keep on going we're never going

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,650
to stop because we don't know what done

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,770
looks like and that's a big problem

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,990
obviously but then we will have the sunk

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,030
cost fallacy where people are like we've

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,310
taken so much time and put in so much

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:44,240
effort we should just see it through

00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:46,400
right ok maybe but usually that's not

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,020
the case

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,720
we also have a problem with killing

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,750
things before they fail when we've got

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,610
project champions those people who are

00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,710
in the group and they've got this

00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,840
reality distortion field you know and

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,480
they're just waving the flag we can do

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,220
it we can do it and they just get this

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,130
groupthink of everyone involved in the

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:10,430
project who they get this deeply deeply

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:13,520
held belief that yeah we can do it yeah

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,890
we can succeed even when all evidence is

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,850
to the contrary people have blind faith

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:22,130
that yes we can do this when there's no

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,040
proof that they actually can and so what

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,800
you end up with is the shambling zombies

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,710
project that never dies another reason

00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,330
we can't pull the

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,090
plug is we aren't taught how to

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,669
communicate we think we're being very

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,890
nice by allowing something to continue

00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,179
rather than telling people I'm sorry we

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,480
have to pull the plug on your project

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:44,880
there are really good easy empathetic

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,649
ways to tell people that we're pulling

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,929
the plug on your project you're not

00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:50,399
being a jerk by doing that you can say

00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:52,710
it in a jerky way and then yeah you are

00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:56,100
a jerk but we don't teach people how to

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:58,890
do this properly and so projects go on

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,980
and on and on and finally they fail and

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,840
everyone's upset so what do we do about

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,980
this what do we do about I already

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,630
mentioned we can't get rid of humans

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,630
that's not one of the options

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,289
organizational changes dealing with

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,659
people anything dealing with people is

00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:18,750
hard I'm in management trust me it's

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:22,169
hard they're hard to start they're even

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,970
harder to finish so keep in mind this is

00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,580
these are going to be very difficult

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,830
things but they're usually worthwhile

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,299
for starters research shows again and

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,340
again and again any sort of

00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,169
organizational initiative if it doesn't

00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,630
get support from the top this is where

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:40,080
grassroots does not necessarily work you

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:42,120
have to get support from the top or else

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,659
your organizational change will not

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,669
succeed ideally your support from the

00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,039
top and this failure stopping initiative

00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:53,279
should be the leaders discussing their

00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,380
own failures their leaders showing what

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,919
they've learned from their failures and

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,110
showing people it's okay and that starts

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,899
to create something that we call an

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,830
environment a psychological safety

00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:09,779
because people see it's okay to fail

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:14,360
now again experiences automatic learning

00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:16,380
is not mistakes are also not automatic

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,090
mistakes are only mistakes because

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,149
somebody points at a and says yo that's

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,409
a mistake before that it's just a

00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:26,580
learning opportunity it's just

00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:30,210
experience now learning it develops

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:34,159
intuition it develops skills how many of

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,340
you out there are senior technical staff

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,630
okay

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,760
I can actually see these hand a little

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,159
bit so I lied earlier um you can put

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,119
your hands down now I can guarantee you

00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,109
didn't become senior

00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:48,119
technical staff because of your age you

00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:53,369
became senior technical staff because

00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:57,179
dude you've seen some man okay and

00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:59,399
I mean you've experienced failure but

00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:02,159
you learned from it you develop

00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,859
intuition and skill and you are using

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,669
those past failures to prevent future

00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:10,739
failures so that's really important we

00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,299
need the failures to do this but you

00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:14,399
can't do that if you're not neat an

00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:19,229
environment where it's safe to make the

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:22,529
failure studies finally are coming out

00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:25,499
all about psychological safety and you

00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:28,139
can find them in the bibliography and we

00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:30,749
are showing that psychologically safe

00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:32,519
teams are the ones that the most

00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:34,739
productive they're the most innovative

00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,599
they are the most cost effective so

00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,999
aside from taking care of your team

00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,089
being just the right thing to do in a

00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:44,159
humane way if that's not good enough for

00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:48,299
you oh honey please it is so good for

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,979
your bottom line so there's lots of good

00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:55,049
reasons to create psychologically safe

00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:56,669
teams so as you're doing your pre

00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:58,649
mortems your post mortems as you're

00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:02,309
having all these discussions around your

00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:04,529
project bring in outside people and not

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,419
just outside from other teams other

00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:08,159
development teams but I'm talking you

00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,129
know bring in customer service bring in

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,529
users bring in marketing and finance

00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:16,079
bring in people who don't think the same

00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:17,939
way you do and have them in your

00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,469
pre-mortem have them in your post mortem

00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:21,629
they're going to ask a lot of really

00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:23,659
interesting questions about things that

00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:26,279
you have been ignoring and glossing over

00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:29,189
these are project skeptics these are

00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,209
these are truth seekers and they are

00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:32,819
really valuable

00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:35,009
they help surface a lot of things that

00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,469
you otherwise wouldn't see and our

00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:39,619
latent errors or failures waiting to

00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,619
happen

00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:46,289
you can also make your projects just

00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,989
more survivable you know just if you're

00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:52,679
going to try stuff make it easier to try

00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:55,260
stuff first of all the easiest project

00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,960
to survive is one you don't even start

00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,270
so ask yourself do we really need to do

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,600
this do we really need to reinvent the

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,730
wheel again or can't we just use it

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,240
library that someone else's used all

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:12,100
right so don't start them at all as

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,409
manager I like this one build in

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,890
checkpoints and milestones into every

00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:19,210
project and if you do funding for a

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,630
project if you're in a big corporation

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,610
that does that sort of funding thing

00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,590
then only fund to a checkpoint otherwise

00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,900
just make this checkpoint a place where

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,809
everyone in the entire organization

00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,480
knows this is a no go no-go situation if

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:37,690
you're not actually moving us towards

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,049
our goal at that checkpoint we will

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,030
probably cancel you but that's okay and

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,130
make sure everyone knows that's okay

00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,929
it's not a sign that you have failed in

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,950
any way just means we're going to move

00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:52,419
on to something else it's fine and if

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,940
you do have something that is

00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:56,860
potentially not very survivable if you

00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,850
have a project that is going to be a

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,070
little more complicated or involved spin

00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,409
it off get it away if you have a project

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,940
that's going to explode honey get it

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,890
away from the things that might be hit

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,780
by the shrapnel

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,309
you know because otherwise that you're

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,539
going to have ripple effects from that

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:19,090
potential failure should it actually

00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:22,980
fail all right so let's talk about some

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:25,270
ways that you can work with failure

00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,480
experiments are controlled failure and

00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,370
they are amazing we literally as human

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,700
beings would not be here without failure

00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,919
and that's because of evolution in

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,520
life-forms as in all other things no

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,140
change is possible without some failure

00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,570
evolution itself is just a constant

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,610
series of works for now solutions and

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,350
maybe in a thousand years will have a

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,230
better it works for now solution it's

00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,919
just constant series of these so your

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,059
experimentation should also be similarly

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,090
continuous if you want your business and

00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:01,000
your project to evolve as you're doing

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,919
your experiments you have something in

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,870
mind we're testing for this we want it

00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,649
to look like this and this is your

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:10,899
success right redefine that's

00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:14,259
don't have your success for your

00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:16,509
experiment B we got the outcome that we

00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:18,730
were hoping for have success for your

00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:20,919
experiment mean oh we learn something

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:24,509
really good that we can use for future

00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:29,739
experiments so seek the truth first and

00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:31,929
traditional success second now

00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:34,299
experiments can be very risky remember

00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:37,029
the shrapnel all right but that doesn't

00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:39,220
mean they all have to be risky think of

00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:42,549
experiments like your financial

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,369
portfolio balance them with high risk

00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:47,080
and low risk because otherwise you're

00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:49,090
going to put your company your team your

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,879
project all these things at jeopardy if

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,779
everything is high risk also like

00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:58,059
investing do it for the long-term right

00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,710
you don't just do that day trading and

00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:00,970
assume you're going to make millions of

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,509
dollars because that's not the way

00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:06,639
trading works if you invest in the long

00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,260
term with your experiments you are

00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:10,629
experimenting multiple times you're not

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,889
just trying once having it not get the

00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:14,609
outcome you want and then walking away

00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,929
done we tried it it's not going to work

00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:19,839
because that's that's not the way you

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:22,990
can have successful experiments the

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,359
nature of successful experiments we do

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,040
like to say fail fast most of us don't

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,809
really know what that entails but it

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,520
does start with making things small and

00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,960
survivable again I talked about

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,839
survivable with that nice little

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,329
shrapnel metaphor but if we keep

00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:40,299
experiments small not only are they

00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:43,450
quicker to iterate upon but it also

00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:46,299
means that the outcomes are very very

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,549
closely situated to the actions which

00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:53,379
means we can more easily determine

00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:55,119
cause-and-effect when you go into an

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:56,619
experiment assume they're going to fail

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,849
I just said assume I'm sorry we're not

00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:59,619
supposed to assume anything

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,140
I will acknowledge that we are assuming

00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:04,030
here and I will confirm it later but

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,069
expect that some of them will fail

00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,270
because if you don't then you're going

00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:11,680
to be very disappointed with your

00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:13,960
experiments and you have explicit

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,059
success and failure criteria know what

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,980
you're looking for and if you don't know

00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:19,780
that you can't know when you're not

00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,370
hitting that mark you can't know what

00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,620
failure looks like

00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:26,110
and to make everybody again more

00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,320
psychologically safe have an exit

00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,450
strategy one of the things that research

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,850
finds is that people are unwilling to

00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,990
say that their experiment failed because

00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,900
they don't know what's going to happen

00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,370
to them personally at the end well my

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,150
project failed so what am I gonna get

00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:44,590
canned you you can come up with an exit

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,690
strategy for these things you can make

00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,040
people feel more secure they know what's

00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,020
going to happen to them at the end and

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,190
it's not bad but if you don't have an

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,160
exit strategy people will be

00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:56,500
uncomfortable

00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,210
okay so introspection which is really

00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,080
not a great title for this slide but

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,430
we're gonna work with it you each and

00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,920
every one of you beautiful individuals

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,510
in this this hall you want to get better

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,080
from failure you want to learn from it

00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,640
the best way to do that is to actively

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,190
start inspecting your failure

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,060
environment so what sort of questions

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,710
should you be asking what are you trying

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,590
to accomplish if you can't answer that

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,660
and if everyone in your team in your

00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,630
project can't answer that the same way

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,270
you might have a problem step number one

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,770
make sure you know what you're doing

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,570
what's your user trying to accomplish if

00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,370
you're doing this for yourself whatever

00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,620
your project is that's one thing but if

00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:41,620
you're doing it for some external entity

00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:44,710
or person make sure you don't assume you

00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,320
know the answer to this question what

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:50,260
are those assumptions list them out be

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,760
very explicit about it because you want

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,640
to check in on them to make sure they

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,670
still hold true or not true or you still

00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,370
need more information have you looked

00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:03,030
for latent errors probably not because

00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,030
most people don't

00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:10,300
what does failure look like most people

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,640
if you think of this at all you think of

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,280
it in the success case but it's not

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,620
always obvious it's not simply black and

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,780
white that failure is the opposite of

00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,520
what you had to find a success so be

00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,580
very explicit what failure looks like

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,290
and then be very clear with people

00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,440
what's going to happen should their

00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,840
experiment fail because then they will

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,580
feel more safe even trying because there

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,640
isn't that giant question mark hanging

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,589
over their heads

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,569
do you have a post mortem process do you

00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,309
have a promoter and process figure that

00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:42,170
out in advance so everybody knows there

00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:45,619
is an preset expectation that you will

00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:48,289
be doing this how does your organization

00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:50,119
treat failure if it punishes failure you

00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:53,420
can try to change your organization but

00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,989
frankly between you me and the wall get

00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:59,900
out because there are some things that

00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:01,970
you just can't change on your own and if

00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,650
your organization is pointing fingers

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,089
and blaming people and punishing for

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,259
failure that's one of the things that's

00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:09,410
going to be very difficult for you to

00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:12,410
change as is an a culture that doesn't

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:13,970
provide psychological safety if you're

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,249
not in a psychologically safe

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,380
environment if you don't feel you have

00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:21,140
the freedom and the support to

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,910
experiment and to fail then you might

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,910
need to find a job that will allow you

00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:28,279
to do that now the answers to all of

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,690
these questions they're going to be

00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:30,950
different for each and every project

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,380
each and every team each and every

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,880
company right and so therefore the

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,410
solutions are also going to be different

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,480
for each and every project and team and

00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,460
company and that's why there is no

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,589
silver bullet here that's why I can't

00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,269
just hand you this happy little serum

00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:47,059
that's going to make all failure go away

00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:48,410
forever it's actually really hard to do

00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,369
this properly you do have to think

00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:53,150
everything through

00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:55,460
so please just take the time ask these

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,710
questions answer these questions and

00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,650
communicate your failures across the

00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,480
entire organization for those of us

00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,009
those of you who have been snapping

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,119
pictures all this of all the slides

00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:08,230
you're going to be very disappointed to

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,380
learn they're already available online

00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:13,819
so they are here at internet archive

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,279
also here is a link to that bibliography

00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:18,529
I mentioned my contact information

00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:20,900
twitter handle at the top freenode irce

00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:24,499
and nick in the middle and my email

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,299
address and of course my book I will

00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:28,670
leave this up while we do Q&A so are

00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:34,489
there any questions but not comments

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:37,819
disguised as questions please come on up

00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:42,319
to the microphone it looks like we have

00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:44,589
three and a half minutes maybe four

00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,589
minutes

00:39:52,610 --> 00:40:00,380
thank you for the talk thank you live

00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:02,480
demo a lot of these complexity analyses

00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,430
are always concerning about what happens

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,230
when things go wrong with complexity and

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,930
I feel like the other half of the coin

00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,390
is can complexity work for us like are

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,680
there anything like latent successes I

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,540
think a lot of people would call this

00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,760
luck but I'm curious if anything in the

00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,620
research has talked about latent

00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,840
successes or how interacting variables

00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,120
might contribute to our success

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,180
they they do talk a lot about variables

00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,310
um very few of them think of them or

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,370
discuss them in context of latent

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,200
successes because nobody's interested in

00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:35,330
that frankly we're all very interested

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,400
in the failures because we love watching

00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,600
a train wreck

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,460
it's just when those things we do in

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,320
humanity right we we love clicking

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,960
through on those horrible clickbait you

00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,610
know things that we see on BuzzFeed so

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,280
no that's it's actually a really good

00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:52,010
perspective though which is why I

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,710
recommend that in your post-mortem you

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,780
also look at the successes right because

00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,880
those are very telling as well they can

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,470
tell you a lot about a what you did

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:07,130
wrong but also they can help find the

00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:08,960
latent errors next hi for those of us

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,540
who are not at the top or close to the

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,090
top what tips if any of you have for

00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,800
trying to convince upwards to adopt

00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:19,130
things like this or how do we be more

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:22,220
helpful towards leaders who do want to

00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,390
adopt things ideas like this you see

00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,770
this is really weird because I'm used to

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,440
repeating the questions and I don't have

00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:31,460
to so so how do you manage up

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,320
essentially yeah it depends I don't know

00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,150
the people you're working with and the

00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,760
answer to how do I manage up or how do I

00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:42,260
manage at all is one of ethical

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,550
manipulation and in order to ethically

00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,960
manipulate you have to know which

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,360
buttons to push and those buttons are

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,090
different for everyone but it you do

00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,870
have to understand what they value right

00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:56,780
do they value certain things like you

00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,820
know success probably you know and and

00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,160
so you can couch things in a term in

00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,840
terms of things that will push their

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,880
buttons that will help them understand

00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,450
this isn't just for us this is also

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,180
going to help you

00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:12,000
and help show them how this is going to

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,510
support everyone in the group but it can

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,480
often help to lead by example here and

00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:22,079
rather than going up first go lateral

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,900
and work within your team and have your

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,369
team be the shining example of

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,020
collaboration and communication and you

00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:30,359
know pre-mortem x' and post mortems and

00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,630
documentation o for love a dog please

00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:36,869
doc everything you know and that can

00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:39,480
help then become your pilot project and

00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:41,070
you can point to it it's very helpful to

00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,500
point to something and say look this is

00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,960
successful can you help me scale this up

00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,760
and they're more likely to listen to you

00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,470
at that point thank you welcome hello hi

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,420
thanks

00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:57,960
so you mentioned spin it off for a

00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:00,060
high-risk project that kind of felt like

00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,619
just basically delegating off like

00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,440
people who are gonna die in an explosion

00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,880
to die what can you say a little more

00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,119
about that

00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,050
so this often is done with companies as

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,450
they are they they want to do some sort

00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,829
of skunkworks type thing and it's not

00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,349
going to work in their existing

00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,640
organization because it's going to make

00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,770
other people jealous that they're not

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,440
working on the skunkworks it might

00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:27,390
actually impact their work on other

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,250
products you know and so they will spin

00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,950
it off into another company to another

00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,349
team into a lab and they will spin it

00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:37,109
off like that now well I do say

00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:39,930
explosion and shrapnel that does imply

00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:42,480
that I assume which we shouldn't do

00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:45,569
I assume it's going to fail and it might

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,270
not so I'm not necessarily sending

00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:50,579
people off to their deaths because it

00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,980
could be a very successful situation and

00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:55,290
often spinning these projects out in

00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,540
that way gives people a lot more freedom

00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:59,700
than they would otherwise so they can

00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,770
experiment more and do things that they

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,660
wouldn't otherwise be able to do in the

00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,910
typical structure of the group they were

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,839
in so there it does give you a lot more

00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:12,780
freedom in that way and again have an

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,839
exit strategy let people know what

00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,420
happens if this fails what happens if we

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,890
can't make this experiment work right

00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,250
we're gonna bring you all back in you're

00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,740
gonna work

00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,000
this we're gonna move you to another lab

00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:26,340
so people know that they're not just

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,810
going to get cut okay thank you

00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,370
welcome we are have 40 minutes or 40

00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:37,260
seconds if there's any more questions

00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:37,380
otherwise okay great thank you all thank

00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:44,659
