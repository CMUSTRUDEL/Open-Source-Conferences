Title: Mariatta Wijaya - What is a Python Core Developer? - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: Mariatta Wijaya

How do you become a Python core developer? How can I become one? What is it like to be a Python core developer?

These are the questions I often receive ever since I became a Python core developer a year ago. Contributing to Python is a long journey that does not end when one earns the commit privilege. There are responsibilities to bear and expectations to live up to.

In the past year, I've been learning more about what it really means to be a Python core developer. Let me share all of that with you.

hello everybody welcome to our next

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:10,710

excited about this session gonna have a

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,820
great talk on what it is to be a Python

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,369
core developer and giving the speech is

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:27,470
my friend here maryada we yaha we see I

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,599

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,300
we won't be having any Q&A afterwards

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,160
but I'm sure Marietta would be happy to

room for like 45 minutes I think it's

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,600
good that we all know each other more so

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm pretty sure everyone in this room

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,119
use Python right you have written at

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,619
least hello world with Python yes you

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,240
use f strings yes and you're all here

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,689
are members of the Python community

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,939
you're here at PyCon meeting interacting

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,400
with other Python is this you're all

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,159
member of the community and and I

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,380
believe many of you here do give back to

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,049
the community by contributing to open

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,079
source can I see how many people have at

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,710
least made one pull request to any open

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,479
source project to see Python there's a

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,189
lot of you there's a lot of you that's

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,470
great that's awesome so thank you so

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,290
much for contributing to open source and

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,030
to see Python

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:57,600
alright Who am I now I am really busy

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,490

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,940
ladies

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,519

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:49,019
PI Cascades so the next one will happen

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,510
in Seattle sometime in 2019 and on top

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,069
of all that I I do contribute to open

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,850
source so it's kind of a new thing for

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,849
me I just really started doing that two

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:03,799
years ago I I really feel a newbie when

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,720
it comes to open source so but last year

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,080
somehow they granted me the commit write

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:16,799
to see Python I can now call myself a

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,780
Python core developer and this talk is

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,790
all about this like since I became a

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,640
core developer everybody has lots of

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,769
questions like what even is a Python

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,239
core developer like what is it like how

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:32,160
can they become a core developer so to

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,350
save myself from answering all of that

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,600
for future generations I'm just gonna

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,560
answer all of that here in this talk and

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,590
I can point them to this video next time

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,380
and to help illustrate the journey I'm

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,470
gonna borrow this diagram which I saw it

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,620
by Caribbean Lyceum I saw this from dr.

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,420
Russell Keith McGee's keynote speech he

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,359
called is the open source conversion

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,670
funnel so he described it as follows

00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,010
like there is a universe of people who

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,780
could potentially use your project some

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,190
of the potential users eventually find

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,530
your project and start using a project

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,079
and some of the new users sticks around

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,299
and becomes a regular user some of the

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,739
regular users stick around and start

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,320
participating in a community becoming

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,669
community members some of the community

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,160
members start contributing to the

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,599
project and become contributors some of

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,310
the contributors stick around long

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,960
enough and eventually becomes the core

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,370
team and some of the core teams becomes

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,620
the leader of the community

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:37,139
I copied it McGee and he talked really

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:41,729
fast too so throughout this talk I will

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:44,850
start with this diagram except I'm gonna

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,040
flip it upside down I felt the journey

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,199
has been more like climbing up the

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,590
ladder going up in the food chain

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,060
instead of going down like that

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:59,760
and I wouldn't be distinguishing between

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,419
potential users or new users let's just

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,150
talk about everyone's the user of Python

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:10,800
and in place of the leader we have to be

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,930
the FL and in my opinion the core team

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,180
they also become the leaders of the

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,080
community and I will talk about a more

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,840
of that later but this is how I felt my

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,930
journey has been I started as a user I

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,210
used Python and then I started getting

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,310
involved in the community going to

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,919
conferences I went to PyCon I went to

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,710
meetups and then I started contributing

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,139
to open source and eventually they gave

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,560
me commit right and I become the core

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,289
team members and I think that's where

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,030
the journey ends like the BD FL nobody

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:52,370
will replace him he will be around

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:56,419
forever forever now back to the question

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:59,010
what is a Python core developer

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:02,300
technically it just means that you have

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:06,000
the commit right to see Python and

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,700
currently there are 89 people in this

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,280
whole world this programming language

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:17,160
with seven million users there are 89

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:19,650
people with such commit writing comes

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,940
with certain nice perks so I get to have

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:27,720
this cool Python logo next to my name in

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,760
the back tracker I get to come to the

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,630
Python language submit free admission

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,580
free lunch

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,470
and it happens every year at PyCon us

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,290
and I get to come to buy some coarse

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,660
prints and uh it seems to be happening

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:47,120
annually I really hope it just becomes

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:50,810
an annual tradition but it comes with

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,900
certain responsibilities once you were

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:57,460
granted commit right you will be added

00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,350
to the Python core team on github and

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,700
you will be added you will be

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:07,220
responsible for 17 repositories

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,160
obviously the C Python the Deaf guide

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:14,720
the paps our workflow performance and

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,350
all our github BOTS you'll be expected

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,990
to subscribe and participate in various

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:24,110
Python mailing lists Python runs our

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:28,040
mailing list so it means you'll get

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,990
thousands of emails I have thousands of

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,320
emails I receive thousands of emails my

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,290
inbox is full I have to figure out today

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:42,040
so you're going to have to learn how to

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:43,660
manage your emails I said that you'll be

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,380
responsible I talked about

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:50,060
responsibilities what I meant is that

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,300
it's expected that you're going to have

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,740
to review a lot of for requests today

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,900
there are more than 600 still open and

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,910
you're going to have to make decisions

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,890
whether you want to accept those peers

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:10,160
or said no and in the past year core

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:14,170
developers has closed more than 6,000

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,560
for requests that's a lot of work and

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,910
when you do accept the full request

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,260
you've gotta be prepared to face the

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,180
consequence I mean if if everything's

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,930
fine it was the right decision usually

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,140
nobody said anything but if it was the

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,490
wrong decision that it actually breaks

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:40,330
things introduced bugs

00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,820
the person who merged the poor requests

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,890
we all have to take the blame you will

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,610
be responsible and follow up and try to

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:55,490
fix things just because you merge it

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:57,440
so it's a huge responsibility and then

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,410
you're going to be expected to help

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,930
people to contribute to cpython because

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:07,640
you you know how to contribute you know

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,930
what you expect and since you have the

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,720
commit right to cpython

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,590
you get to make decisions you get to

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:21,620
tell people what goes in to python or

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:25,550
not you get to shape the language decide

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:28,780
how it's going to evolve that's a huge

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:34,790
responsibility and that makes you the

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:39,410
representative and leader of Python the

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:42,170
language and the community yes there's

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:46,070
there's a PDF file he makes a lot of big

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:48,650
decisions but he takes input from the

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,350
core developers he relies on us to and

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,810
he delegates many things to the core

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,640
developers often he just say I want

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,240
these to happen and core developers make

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,790
it happen

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,480
so we're his helpers well his

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:06,410
second-in-command core developers are

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,900
the leaders of this community so now

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,080
I've talked a lot about what being a

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,270
core developer is people still have lots

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,460
of questions about it so I'm going to

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:21,830
answer them one by one this is one of

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,600
the most frequent question I got a new

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:31,850
user or somebody I just met asked how

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:34,250
they can be a core available but this is

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:38,960
a really big question it's difficult

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,700
concept to explain to just a user so I'm

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,750
going to try to answer some really easy

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:48,200
questions first how can someone be more

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:51,350
involved in the community this is really

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,940
easy because there are lots of ways to

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:58,550
be involved anyone can take part you

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:02,390
start locally help out your local Python

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,070
Meetup I run meetups I know we're always

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,300
looking for help we're always looking

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,670
for people to speak give workshop teach

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:14,180
so if you want to help out reach out to

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,270
your local meetup organizers tell them I

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,780
want to give a talk I know a venue where

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,920
you can host made ups help them out and

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,460
if there's no Meetup

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,620
start one if you don't like to do

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,050
meetups it's too much for you that's

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,980
fine you can just write blogs about

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,810
Python share to the world how you you

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,060
use Python write about your favorite

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,830
library write a tutorial or just spread

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:44,660
the knowledge of Python to everyone

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,970
volunteer at conferences that's a good

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,090
way to contribute back to the community

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:55,570
especially here at PyCon PyCon

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:58,310
conferences rely on volunteers and

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,980
whenever you're interacting with other

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,910
members of the community always always

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:10,850
be a good person the open considerate

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:15,310
and respectful next question how to

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:18,620
contribute to open source lots of ways

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,610
join the communication channels join

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,660
their mailing list

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,880
Ayana see kitaru slack just get to know

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,750
other country viewers get to know the

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,850
maintainer help by reporting issues tell

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,650
us how to reproduce bugs that you

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,080
encounter propose new ideas help with

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,830
documentation this is really important

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,050
every projects I've participated in

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,680
really could use help in the

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,780
documentation review pull request and

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,250
again you're interacting with other

00:12:50,780 --> 00:13:00,850
contributors always be open be a good

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:04,550
person be considerate and respect now

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:08,560
usually after I answer all that the next

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:11,960
follow-up question is always well

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,200
actually I just want to contribute to

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,950
code not the documentation maybe I can

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,230
start with me

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:23,240
but eventually I want to contribute to

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:26,000
code tell me how all right I guess

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,110
people really have this specific desire

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,840
to contribute to codes

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,750
sure if the goal is don't come tribute

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,900
to code you have to first rate the

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,440
contribution guide every large project

00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,880
has one everyone every project has

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,390
different guide different workflow you

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,570
have to up first read that and then find

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:53,360
an issue to work on and then you have to

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:59,530
learn how to use version control like

00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,910
get and then create a pull request and

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,940
then the follow-up question through this

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:07,850
is okay Mary receives your Python core

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,150
developer please be more specific and

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,480
tell me how to contribute code to see

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,420
python this is this is the biggest

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,440
mystery everybody wants to know this and

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:24,080
I I wanted to know this too I asked this

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,670
very same question to the media fellow

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:33,380
two years ago and so I'm just going to

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:36,560
tell you what he told me first with the

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,960
dev guide it really has everything you

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,510
need to know the Deaf guide tells you

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,210
how to get the source code how to use

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,630
kit where our mailing list are how to

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,990
run tests how to compile everything he

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:55,580
said here this is the URL that guy read

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:58,040
it and then next he told me join the

00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,770
core mentorship and Python death mailing

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,590
list and if I ever need had ever have

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,280
questions just ask me the mailing list

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,280
is that just tell them Guido sent you

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,280
okay

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,709
really the first few emails I wrote to

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,490
the mailing list

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:20,519
it started with hey I asked Widow about

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:25,620
this and he told me to write to you so

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:28,560
here is my question then he pointed me

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,860
to the bug tracker this is where you're

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:36,269
supposed to find issues to work on and

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,579
then said what an easy issue create a

00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:44,339
patch patch at a time pull requests now

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:48,269
so these are what we don't old me simple

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:51,269
sounds like it and he never really

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,890
actually gave me any issues to work on

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,880
he never assigned anything to me because

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,130
he didn't know what I was interested in

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:03,089
so that was something that I had to

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:05,339
learn on my own so I started subscribing

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:09,269
to updates to the bug tracker

00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:13,200
so I get email whenever there are new

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,250
activities and then I try to read some

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:20,970
of them find anything that interests me

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:28,260
and then start researching and figure

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:31,500
out how to fix the bug now at that time

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,829
people that start asking me well since

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,600
you've been following the bug tracker

00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:43,050
maybe you can find me an issue to work

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:46,680
on all right give me some time because

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:49,640
in order to really find an issue I have

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,260
to really really watch the bug tracker

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,180
recent some of the issues that I thought

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,310
could be interesting to you and then

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,470
still ask you whether you're interested

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:03,060
and you might not actually want to be

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:06,390
interested so I think I feel that this

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:09,959
is finding an issue to work on is a

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:14,850
skill you're going to have to acquire to

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:18,089
learn and it's going to take time so you

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,240
shouldn't be relying on me or maintainer

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,730
to assign you an issue it just doesn't

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,680
work like that

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:31,410
so so perhaps people want to hear what

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,320
I've been contributing what are my open

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:39,810
sort of contributing contributions for

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,380
inspiration for examples except I really

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,620
don't think I've had many meaningful

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,270
contributions

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:51,210
I fix a lot of typos really this this

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,250
was one of my first contribution to open

00:17:51,210 --> 00:18:02,760
source and one will change this is how I

00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:05,900
started two years ago I really fix a lot

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:13,220
of typos I was reading a pap saw typos

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:17,070
fixing really the moral of the story is

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,140
my contributions have been accidental

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:23,280
like I was it wasn't intentional but it

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:26,150
wasn't really goal I was learning I read

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:33,660
the docs trying to learn how to use it

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:36,870
so problems and I take them I contribute

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,420
very little code to see Python and

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,390
that's something that seems like

00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,360
everybody expects core developers to be

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,800
contributing code a lot of code well I

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:53,760
don't I write documentation I write to

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,060
fight on the developers guide my github

00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,680
bought right even more code than I have

00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:06,090
ever done to see Python so if if you use

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:09,170
iPhone 3 6 4 or 3 6 5 you're likely

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,870
using code generated by my github bot

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:16,260
and I I participate in mailing list help

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:19,310
answer questions and I like to review

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,680
pull requests I try to prioritize

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:25,350
reviewing pull requests from first-time

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,170
contributors because I want to be the

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,630
one to congratulate you on your first

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:34,310
pull request to see Python so that's

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,310
that's how I've been contributing

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,870
and there are lots of open-source

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,470
projects out there that really could use

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,440
help

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:49,050
I just contribute to tools I use in love

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,810
I contribute to Colin

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,140
I made a contribution to warehouse a

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,990
couple months ago I use github and a

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:02,190
HTTP for my BOTS so I started

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:06,300
contributing them to really like look at

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:10,380
your requirements txt file and think of

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,420
contributing them don't be fixated in

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:17,570
contributing just to see Python there

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:20,190
are a lot of open source projects now

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,470
once people start contributing to see

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:28,110
Python they they all have the same

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:34,520
questions please when can you review my

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:38,160
PR I'm sorry I'm really sorry that I

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:42,660
haven't got around reviewing your PR and

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:47,010
now let me share you some numbers since

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:51,990
the migration to get up February 2017 we

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:55,110
have more than 65,000 pull requests we

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:59,730
have closed a lot of them like more two

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:01,850
days I think we merged 5200 the thing is

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,590
that I'm just there's so many of you

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:10,880
there are so many people contributing

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:14,430
more than 800 in the last year there are

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,970
even though there are close to 90 core

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:23,370
developers only half of them are still

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:26,970
active in the last year so we just don't

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,370
have enough time to review everything so

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,830
I'm really really sorry

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:35,340
but there are other reasons in addition

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,260
to not having enough time sometimes it's

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,940
just not my expertise I don't think I

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,560
should be reviewing it I think it's

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,220
something for other color weapons to

00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,909
review that's why I haven't review it or

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,470
maybe I just

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:54,279
it sounds bad I just didn't care it's

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:57,679
it's it's not my interest area and I

00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,799
didn't ask for this change you went

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,489
ahead and cleared up er anyway so i'm

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,009
sorry and i know i when i want to read

00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:12,440
jack appear i'm supposed to explain to

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:14,779
you why i am rejecting it but a lot of

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:20,749
time I have no good reason I just don't

00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:24,409
want it I don't I'm sorry that I find it

00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:28,179
easier to just abandon it and leave it

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:32,679
to the next core developer to review

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:41,419
then to actually say no to you so again

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:44,299
I'm sorry I'm also Canadian so and as

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:48,279
I've mentioned a real accepting a peer

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:52,389
comes with certain consequence and I

00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:59,450
don't always want to accept such

00:22:52,389 --> 00:23:00,889
responsibilities again sorry okay let's

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,679
go back to this really really difficult

00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:07,729
question how to become a Python core

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:11,809
available this is big and and it's

00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:14,330
hardly involve multiple stages but I've

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:16,669
explained to you how to get involved in

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,729
the community and how to start

00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:22,580
contributing and I've explained what are

00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:28,789
the responsibilities of Python core

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:34,580
developers so kind of broken those apart

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:38,330
into smaller questions this is a much

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:41,509
smaller scope how can a contributor to

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:45,889
see Python become a Python core

00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:49,309
developer now when we want to promote

00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:57,470
somebody to be a core developer we have

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:59,410
one really big question can we trust

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,030
this person

00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,610
you're going to be when we give you

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,710
commit right to see Python you will be

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:13,040
responsible for programming language

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:15,440
used by seven million people and if you

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,480
do inspire to be Co developer you need

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:23,740
to earn our trust and there is no other

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,740
way for us to learn to trust you

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,320
other than actually interacting with you

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,530
and these interactions can be in a form

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,770
of you contributing you're participating

00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:39,800
in mailing list you made pull requests

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:42,790
you review pull requests for us the more

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:46,550
you do those the more we get to know you

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:50,620
the more we know you the more we can

00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:53,000
learn whether to trust you or not and

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:57,220
then you're going to have to accept all

00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,790
the responsibilities I've said that and

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:05,210
above all we do need to know that you're

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:09,470
a good person that you'll be kind be

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,510
open considerate and respectful to other

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:20,060
core developers and to other

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:22,430
contributors now a lot of people then

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:26,000
ask me well how did you do all this how

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:29,030
did you earn the trust how did you

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,210
become core developer I really don't

00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,610
know don't don't ask me I I I really

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,830
don't know this is a question you need

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:40,670
to ask to other core developer at v--

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:46,100
for me I really just feel lucky so a

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:48,890
squid or a snake as Brad Raymond they

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:56,090
they know why I why they trust me I

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:59,900
don't I really just feel lucky how much

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:04,390
time I spend contributing way too much

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,270
time then I'm willing to admit so I

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:10,660
realized I had too much time in the open

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,960
source so in the past two months I've

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,820
taken a break sighs

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,660
I'm not contributing until the end of

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:22,350
the month and um except for the days

00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:32,610
when I'm at PyCon and at the spring

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:34,980
way too much time so this people do ask

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:39,500
me this and it always feels like a trick

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,940
question I asked this

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,390
couple days ago here at this conference

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,340
I got asked when I was at PyCon it tell

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,910
ya I was asked when I was at PyCon

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:56,370
Australia people around the world are

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:57,750
curious no I don't I don't get paid to

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,700
contribute to Python

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:07,320
my salary is zero and as the core

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:10,100
developer I don't receive salaries very

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:14,340
few core developers are getting paid

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:17,400
some kauravas got paid to contribute but

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:24,960
not full-time they still put in a lot of

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:30,990
personal time into Python another big

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:34,880
mystery how do i balance all of this III

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,440
don't know I do not have balance I

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,330
forget a lot of things I keep forgetting

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,880
to take my vitamins I run late

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,060
appointments and I double booked

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:52,520
appointment I don't have things I don't

00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:54,510
have my life all balanced I don't know I

00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:00,210
thought I was done with the big

00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:05,310
questions but I ask this question every

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:10,430
day some kordell's has asked me the same

00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:13,800
question the VFL asked me this question

00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:16,790
how can we get more women to contribute

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,790
to open source

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,790
let me first share some numbers

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,120
Python has seven million users and I'm

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:34,280
pretty sure it's a very diverse set of

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:38,000
users and our communities is diverse

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,820
I see our even here at PyCon I see many

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,690
women participating I see lots of people

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,960
of color

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:48,710
I see disabled people I see

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,900
transgender people I see diversity in

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,789
this conference and I think we've done a

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:59,289
great job at that so now let's look at

00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:01,809
the contributors to cpython

00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:09,789
I've told you we have more than 800

00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:16,669
contributors in the last year a lot of

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:26,210
out of all those 800 less than 10 or

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:33,340
women no 10% 10 individuals we have a

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:33,340
team and core developers only two women

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:53,380
I let the shock wears off because this

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:57,640
is real but this is also wrong this is

00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:03,430
not the right representation of our

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:08,660
community this is not leadership

00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:12,620
qualities you should not try to achieve

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:18,400
this you should try to avoid this kind

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,400
of statistics in your own organization

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:26,450
this is this is a problem and I'm

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:31,100
putting this out there so that you can

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:40,100
see what I've been seeing in the last

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:41,809
year I see a gap a really huge gap and I

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:46,520
don't know what to do about it

00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:51,470
I need help I really don't know what I

00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:53,540
need to do so asking me I ask this to

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,150
myself how to get more women

00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:00,290
contributing and I I really don't know

00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:02,240
if people know of another large open

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:06,020
source project with seven million users

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,690
that is doing good with diversity tell

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:14,320
me about it it's like a little I don't

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:18,860
know and I I care so much about this I

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,670
tried to get professional advice I ask

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:25,130
sharp and I've explained to them the

00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:30,080
situation and I ask if they have an

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:34,820
advice and what can I pass on core

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:40,160
developer do to improve the diversity in

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:43,850
the community so they gave me some

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:47,540
advice they said I need to identify the

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,440
problems and they also told me that it's

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:53,830
not something I can do on my own

00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I'm going to need all the corners to

00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:59,440
participate and work on improving

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:16,070
identifying problems I really had to ask

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:19,190
myself like what are their barriers what

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:25,190
are the bearings that applies only to

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:29,240
women that somehow 800 men were able to

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:35,420
contribute to cpython and only so few

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:39,050
women the there are lots of problems and

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:43,820
for me personally I've I faced the same

00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:51,850
barriers I'm not gonna say all of them

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:55,700
here but one of the barriers was I

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:59,620
didn't have any role models I didn't see

00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:03,080
anyone who looked like me

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:07,790
participating in open source for a long

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,410
time I believed it's just maybe I

00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:16,070
shouldn't be doing maybe it's just not

00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:18,590
the place for people like me and it it

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:22,960
was a huge barrier that I had to

00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:26,540
overcome and I just feel so lucky that

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,270
there are members of this community that

00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,790
the BDF algorithm and my son core

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,580
developers have always been there for me

00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:39,230
supporting me helping me throughout this

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:44,660
Tamia I I just felt like it so thank you

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:46,100
all but we we have to do better and the

00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,840
core developers do want to do better

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:56,140
they've acknowledged that there is still

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:58,910
diversity problem in our community and

00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,280
during the language summit few days ago

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,659
after the core developers that they need

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,679
to take part

00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:08,569
I've taught them that going forward

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,060
they're going to have to do at least one

00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:14,389
of the following they're gonna have to

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,720
provide mentorship prioritizing women

00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:19,869
and the underrepresented group members

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,859
they could try to set up office hours

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:28,250
AMA citizens one-on-ones and I've made

00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:32,179
them understand that public forums like

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:35,569
mailing lists are always the safe space

00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:40,310
for women and minorities to ask

00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:43,369
questions so I've told them they're

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:48,200
going to have to be available to answer

00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:50,240
questions in private so and the quarter

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,069
levels have been very receptive they are

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,290
all on board and we are working harder

00:34:54,069 --> 00:35:03,589
to try to be more welcoming to women and

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:08,500
minorities still iirc is there anything

00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:10,760
more I could have done to help improve I

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:15,530
mean I've always been available

00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,150
privately my DM is always open six

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,930
suggests that maybe I could start

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:25,280
sharing more of my experiences I thought

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:27,500
I have but she said it they said it

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,940
could inspire me maybe it could inspire

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:34,849
other women I don't know I don't think

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:38,780
I've done anything spectacular I fix

00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:44,690
typos but if sharing my stories can help

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:47,390
then I will try so oh my my name is Mary

00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,520
era I like and strings and you really

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,380
really want to hear my stories you have

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,810

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,810
will be sharing my stories if you wanna

when I have really really long stories I

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:06,190
might just post them on my website that

00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:14,369
is all thank you so much for listening
