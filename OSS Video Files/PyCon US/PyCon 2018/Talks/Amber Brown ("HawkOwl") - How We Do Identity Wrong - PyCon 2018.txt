Title: Amber Brown ("HawkOwl") - How We Do Identity Wrong - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: Amber Brown ("HawkOwl")

Most software has a user. Depending on the software, the user may need to provide various details about themselves for proper operation -- their name, their date of birth, where they live. However, it is quite common for software systems such as these to ask the wrong questions, collect too much data, and when it comes down to it, serialise the parts of the user's identity wrongly. This talk will discuss common ways that real-world systems store identity wrong, what questions you shouldn't ask, and how you can fix it in your own projects.

hey folks hello everyone

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,340
that's so one request if we could try

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,200
and sit in the center of the row so

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,070
people who arrive late can can fit in

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,510
the edges also let's all welcome amber

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:26,279
Brown who's talking about how we do

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:30,539
identity wrong hello can everyone hear

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:34,380
me okay oh good great so I am amber

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,239
huggy Brown computer owl teen lover on

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,360
the Angry Bird website you can find me

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,930
at at ho Qiao I live in I hail from

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,280
Melbourne Australia and my website is at

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:52,250
least for now dotnet if you want to find

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:54,930
me so what is identity who even notice

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,489
the identity of a person is the

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,079
characteristics they have that

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,979
distinguish them from others this is

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,460
composed of internal and external

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:10,200
attributes generally your internal

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,330
tributes are relatively unchangeable

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,520
they are things like your personality

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,150
your gender and your life experience but

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,100
external attributes tend to change more

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,390
things like your address especially if

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,900
you're a millennial and you move every

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,939
year like me your birthday's now

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,090
sometimes there's some wacky things that

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,770
happen with that especially if you were

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,170
if you're older and were born before

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,409
computerized birth certificates some

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,850
people don't know their birth dates your

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,640
nationality might change you might move

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,509
to a different country become a citizen

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,430
of somewhere else

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,829
you've got the country of your birth

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,950
might cease to exist in the form into

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,229
another your name can also change

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,579
throughout your life as well as some

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,350
things that people think that stay

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,299
relatively static like your social

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,649
security number and your Medicare number

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,489
but we as developers we need to

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,090
sometimes know information about users

00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:13,310
so what do we generally store

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,190
name and address is pretty common if

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,720
you're sending people anything date of

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,430
birth you know it's important to know

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,190
that maybe your users are old enough to

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,989
see such content or sign contracts or do

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,510
other sorts of things that your website

00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:28,610
might want to do there naturally

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,280
nationality sometimes you need to record

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,840
that in in case like for example you are

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,849
the United States esta you need to know

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,910
what country someone is someone's

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:40,819
passport is from their gender possibly

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,590
we store that a lot and their social

00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,269
security number or Medicare number for

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,760
looking up in government systems and

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:52,540
other sorts of small attributes like

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:58,030
that now which of these is immutable

00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:00,830
none of them really unfortunately

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,459
reality doesn't really fit in

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,220
well-defined boxes and we as software

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,950
developers love finely defined boxes

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,140
it's great if most things can fit in a

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,630
single single row in the database and

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,310
never change and not have issues that

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,260
wake you up at 3 a.m. where suddenly

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,930
it's someone with a Unicode name types

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,370
in tape types in their name in Unicode

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:29,090
and then suddenly your website falls

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:34,160
over let's tackle the problems names we

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:36,170
screw these up a lot now most angular

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,290
countries such as England and Australia

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,139
and and the United States will generally

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,600
format a name like this you'll have a

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:47,630
title or honorific such as doctor

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,359
professor a given name like from example

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,819
my name is Amber my middle name which is

00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:55,790
hawky my family name which is brown and

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,709
post-nominal titles for example PhD or

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:02,329
MD or something like that which I don't

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:04,430
have because I'm uneducated here is

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:07,609
someone that a lot of us should know

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,100
that very well fits these boxes lady

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:12,489
Augusta at a King Knoll Countess of

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,489
Lovelace

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,919
but sometimes we miss portions of this

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,530
like Sir John Mayer who was Prime

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,849
Minister of the United Kingdom II does

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,849
not have a middle name

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,350
president harry s truman of united

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,670
states

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:36,650
some people might know this but his

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:39,320
middle name is actually s that's it so

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,360
you know you obviously can't rely on a

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,960
middle name they exist being longer than

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,960
one character

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:55,010
now there's the germans this is a real

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:59,450
person and they have no less than seven

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,880
middle names as well as four words in

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,380
their family name now a lot of things

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,530
kind of trip up on that they don't

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,730
expect you to have spaces in your last

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,130
name and a lot of things don't even

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,960
handle hyphens which is funny

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,610
considering that a lot of people have

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,240
hyphens in their last names i think we'd

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,240
be ok at that and then someone like sure

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:27,110
Joe's legal name is just sure a single

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:33,590
given name can sure use your website i'm

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:36,050
guessing no and this is just the angular

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,660
way of sending things in other places it

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,730
works completely different in chinese

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,590
and quite commonly japanese the family

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,080
name comes first and the given name

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,760
comes after so you can't automatically

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,800
assume that whatever the first part is

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,320
is someone's given name and whatever the

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,600
last part is is their family name so if

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,160
you're given just a string of words then

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,100
just someone's name you can't

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,630
automatically split it up into the

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,470
different sections without them

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,610
explicitly doing it themselves now

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,250
there's a lot of common naming

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,230
assumptions that we have and it's

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,270
covered elsewhere but people's names

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,630
having multiple components or not having

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,120
spaces or hyphens people assuming that

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,980
the that the name that is on your

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,570
driver's license or your passport is the

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,270
name that you actually use in day-to-day

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,180
life they're people having one and only

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,740
one middle name that people prefer that

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,100
their given name is the name that you

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:34,820
call them people assuming that names

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,310
don't change or that people have a

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,860
single name that they go by

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,930
now some people who were married may go

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,930
by their maiden name in some in some

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,210
professional contexts while using their

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,520
new married name in other contexts you

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:55,340
can't assume that they might not want to

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:57,110
use both now names are mutable marriage

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,350
is one of the most common reasons

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,120
changing your last name sometimes taking

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,610
one of the the other partners family

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,130
name or all both partners changing their

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:10,190
their family name to a conjoined family

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,350
name gender transition is also a common

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,600
reason as well as witness protection and

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:18,440
some people just don't like the name

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,050
that they were given a birth and how do

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,580
we store them now we need to think of

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,030
the application and the reasons why

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,950
we're storing them now usually it's

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,810
because we're either referencing some

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,240
sort of government system for example if

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,100
you are a medical institution you quite

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,650
often need to use the name there's on

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,990
someone's Medicare documentation or

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,820
you're like a social service and you

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,770
have a more casual use of someone's name

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,919
it doesn't necessarily have to match up

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,510
exactly to what the government says or

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,640
some services it's important to have

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,400
both because you might want to have a

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,030
user have a more you know a preferred

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,130
name while also having in the background

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:02,600
their name verified by some sort of

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:04,160
government institution now if you are

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,900
dealing with government departments it

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,060
is simply just best to use the schema

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,400
that the government uses even if this

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,990
schema is wrong it is unfortunately one

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,080
that will match up consistently with

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,270
their systems and it's likely that the

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,280
person if their name doesn't fit with

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,210
their regular government systems will

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,190
know how to get around it but it is also

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,950
good to use a single field for casual

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,419
users such as the person that you're

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,860
sending a letter to you you don't need

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,599
to break that up into first name and

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,750
last name and all of that sort of stuff

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,419
it just gets printed right on the label

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,089
if you do need to ask for multiple names

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,430
it's best to minimize confusion and make

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,589
it clear what is used we're making it

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,450
clear that this section is what is for

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,270
your government ID and this section is

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,290
what we will call you when you're going

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,170
around the website

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,760
and often if you want to ask for both

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,130
you could always just ask for the

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,410
government's ID first and then have an

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,420
option is your name different than what

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,220
sees on your ID click here and then it

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,840
shows the rest of the options to enter

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,360
their preferred details and don't assume

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,420
that given a name that you can extract

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,180
out portions of it you must ask for this

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,960
if you need it for example my boarding

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:24,440
pass was for someone called amber hawky

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,700
one word doesn't quite match what's on

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,160
my passport to be honest there is this

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,260
classic article which goes into a bit

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,030
more detail about the falsehoods that

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,740
programmers believe about names it's a

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,060
very worthwhile read you can just google

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,040
false ugh programmers believe about

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,780
names then you'll find it there will

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,040
also be slides posted up afterwards for

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:48,920
a nice clickable link at circle Janet

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,110
now this is an interesting one the first

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,870
question asked is what are you going to

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,600
use the information for why are you

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,360
asking do you actually want to ask for

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,580
pronouns to refer to someone throughout

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,350
your website or do you want to know if

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,170
they're interested in gendered products

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,100
such as you know tampons or pregnancy

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,270
tests all that sort of thing

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,270
usually you only really care about

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,700
pronouns so you want to offer common

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,830
pronouns you want to allow custom ones

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,540
as well you don't want to show this

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,040
information publicly by default you

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,080
should leave it up to the user to decide

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,760
whether they want to let that be known

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,790
to the work or to just any random

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,740
passerby and do you actually need to use

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,810
pronouns in your website after all

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,450
usually you can avoid it but if you're

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,370
asking about gender there's sometimes

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,610
legitimate reasons way where you would

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,850
want to ask for example verifying things

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,070
against Medicare and my passport is a

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:52,100
legitimate use sometimes collecting

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:55,460
information about for programs focused

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,130
on gender minorities is important to

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,660
know that they qualify and statistical

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,430
information for example a lot of

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,230
conferences will ask your gender for

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,860
working out demographics to working out

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,550
how

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,829
well certain outreach efforts are going

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,829
and if you must do this it's best to use

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:15,200
a free-form text box or a drop-down box

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,870
that allows you to then type in another

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,930
option fits everyone doesn't have much

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:25,850
more work and keeps everyone happy now

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,579
addresses now the non Americans in here

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,470
will probably probably be nodding quite

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,810
a bit now things that don't exist

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:37,970
outside of America ZIP codes are a big

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:39,769
thing counties in Arizona if I select

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:48,040
Australia please do not let me select

00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:48,040
Arizona as the state this has happens

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,380
thankfully the Australian post office

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,980
kind of pretty good with working that

00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:01,820
out but things that do exist outside the

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,370
United States Bureau boxes in Australia

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,899
for example commonly accepted and in a

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,550
lot of cases this is the only way you

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,980
can get a package delivered if you're in

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,680
a rural place so simply going if it's

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,019
got p.o box in it can't deliver can't

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,430
deliver packages isn't quite accurate if

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:20,510
you're working in places other than

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,810
where you know postcodes can sometimes

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:27,100
have letters in them for example the UK

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,100
the British in the front row is nodding

00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,810
also extremely long town or city names

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,010
and especially once we've spacers like

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:39,050
you'll get in Germany sometimes an

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,959
address isn't a thing that exists at all

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,440
in some places this is a letter that was

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,940
successfully delivered recently there

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,990
was a story where someone sent a letter

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:54,470
labelled sink Lee simply England and it

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:57,110
made its way to its destination forum

00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,610
post post services sometimes know how to

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,620
get a letter places better than you do

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,300
now this is commonly what happens in the

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,730
u.s. you have addressed my one address

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,750
line to a city a postcode or a zip code

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,300
and the country now this fits for a lot

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,779
of places but for example doesn't fit

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,269
some places like the UK or some

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,379
times doesn't match where you're trying

00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:26,389
to interpret things about the address

00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:28,279
it's best to research into the country

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,410
that you're that you're planning to

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,939
deliver services to and match the

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,100
address lines correctly that for their

00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:36,230
and even then sometimes you might just

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,749
have to have a big text box where they

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,910
can just write things in generally the

00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:42,430
post service will get things to where

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,860
they are needed

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,319
is also a falsehood programmers believe

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,889
about addresses which is very UK focused

00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:54,170
and has a lot of lot of interesting

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,670
facts some of which I didn't know and it

00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:00,410
turns out that the UK I'm a surprise

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,850
mail gets anywhere at all I suppose mail

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,279
gets anywhere in Australia that the

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:11,300
trucks don't just you know disappear in

00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:13,459
the Nala ball but anyway now whenever

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,889
you're storing personal information or

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:19,699
asking for it there are dangers and

00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,680
extreme pitfalls great doctor once said

00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:23,149
we should treat personal electronic data

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,939
with the same care and respect as

00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:28,399
weapons-grade plutonium is dangerous

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:30,800
long lasting and once it is leaked there

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,959
is no way of getting it back and this is

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,759
a generally correct assumption those

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,420
that have lived through the Equifax leak

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,339
of 2015 or 2016 whenever it was we'll

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,420
know that once that information is in

00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,730
the public domain

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,740
there's no way of getting it back and

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,199
for a lot of people that's information

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,699
that they can't easily change they can't

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,529
easily change their social security

00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,689
number even if it even if they might be

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,699
able to getting every single person in

00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:58,040
America to change this information to

00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:04,220
prevent themselves being defrauded is an

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,990
unnatural task now if you screw up and

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,629
data does get league especially personal

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,879
data under the new general data

00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,189
protection regulations there are

00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,319
sanctions of a fine of up to 20 million

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:16,790
euros or up to four percent of the

00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,829
annual worldwide turnover of the

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,660
preceding phone of need financial year

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,339
of case of an enterprise Trevor is

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,009
greater if there's been an infringement

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,319
so that makes leaks of personal data not

00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:30,519
only something there's bad for your PR

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,519
but also bad for your wallet

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,639
and ultimately at the end of the day is

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,959
going to be very hard to protect some

00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,769
sensitive information

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,389
have I been pawned is a website that has

00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:43,889
that allows you to check just your email

00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,230
address not other information but your

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:48,120
email address among two hundred eighty

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:53,519
three websites that have had information

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:56,670
leaked that ends up being over five

00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:01,319
billion accounts and probably hundreds

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,420
of millions of people some of these

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:07,050
websites that have been hacked leaked

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,110
more than just names and email addresses

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,279
and hashed passwords one of these people

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,949
that got hacked was a Qatar National

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,689
Bank and then includes all the

00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:18,300
information their bank needs to verify

00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:21,689
that you are a real person and when they

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,819
have that much information a hacker who

00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,759
has this information can then has enough

00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:29,959
to verify that you are genuine to

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,550
basically anywhere else in the world

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,069
when you have information such as this

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,769
that is incorrectly handled it can cause

00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:40,829
the financial financial burdens of

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:45,240
hundreds of thousands of people and a

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:49,610
grand scale so if you don't need the

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,439
information don't store it don't keep it

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,170
it also means that if the worst were to

00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:58,259
come to happen and say some fascist

00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,600
party came to power in some country and

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,370
they started wanting information that

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,610
could be tracked it could be used to

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:09,419
track down every one of a particular

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:11,610
nationality or ethnicity or opinion if

00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,390
you don't keep extraneous information

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:17,280
that has that it means that you are

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,900
doing a good thing and especially in

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,120
this seat the days of this current

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,860
climate collecting mass amounts of user

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,830
data can be a bad thing so think of what

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,169
could happen if the data is not hacked

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,590
but is simply subpoenaed by some

00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,590
government

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:41,290
now we have consequences of our actions

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,850
of the collective of individual people

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,340
we're simply not living in a vacuum

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,440
where we have a website and data happens

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,030
on it and sometimes we get might get

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,430
fined if data gets leaked and all of

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,890
that but this does have effects on

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,810
individual people because at the end of

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,210
the day you are dealing with individual

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,010
people their feelings they have

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:06,830
aspirations they have daily struggles

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:09,830
and your software should be made to help

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,500
them maybe it might not help all of

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,030
these but at the end of the day software

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,750
does not have a point if it does not

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:20,140
help people or at least simplify some

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,580
other task that in the end pulls people

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,950
even if doing your taxes online doesn't

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:30,080
really help you it helps society as a

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:33,230
whole now in a lot of places now

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,320
software is non optional you cannot opt

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,240
out of using something software for

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,960
example banks nowadays when you want to

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,740
do simple tasks will say log on to our

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,110
website use that instead services such

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:51,260
as my gov in Australia have a lot of

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,450
information and allow you to do a lot of

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,610
things for the federal government and a

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,790
lot of them now basically must be done

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,490
online even if you go into their offices

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,340
they all show you to an iPad where you

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:08,270
can then log in you simply cannot say

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:10,010
that no I would I can't worry I I won't

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,740
worry about this because people are

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,010
choosing to use my software there's not

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,200
the case even with for example Facebook

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,960
for lost people is not socially possible

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,720
to opt out of some social networks

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,400
especially in rural towns where it might

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,350
be the only way of communicating with

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,900
some people now when you're in this

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,920
situation especially a situation where

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,350
everything is very social and not just

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,600
interacting with the government knowing

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,780
a person their identity is denying them

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,550
their humanity by making it so that

00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,679
someone cannot be their authentic self

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,200
on your in your

00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,119
we're on your platform you were making

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,360
them lesser of a user than up than

00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:59,809
everyone else and this can lead to

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,059
people being excluded leave them to be

00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:05,149
feeling marginalized and having them be

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:09,649
upset and ultimately your software

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:12,289
should not do that the golden rules are

00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:14,749
to not make assumptions if you're going

00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:17,570
into a new market then you need to ask

00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:19,129
questions about it you need to do a lot

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,679
more research you need to figure out how

00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:24,559
names are common in that jurisdiction

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,590
you need to figure out how addresses

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,110
work you need to make sure that when

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,299
someone goes to use your service or use

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,340
your website that they are actually able

00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,320
to do it in at least in the least

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,480
frustrating way as possible because

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,559
ultimately you want users to use your

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,619
website don't you don't think that

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,749
people are like you even though I

00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,090
personally have a name that works on

00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:52,899
many sites and I'm a binary gender so I

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,299
can simply select female not everyone is

00:20:52,899 --> 00:21:00,499
fortunate enough to you know be able to

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:02,600
have that privilege so don't think

00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:05,360
you'll get it right the first time talk

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,950
to people do your research make sure

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,330
that you can change things later on if

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,779
someone comes to you with a problem

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:14,379
don't be the company that says no our

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:16,820
services can't support a single name

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:22,249
it's simply not possible Muir's have to

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:25,159
put a in the last name box and the best

00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:27,799
way to do that is by thinking ahead when

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,169
you are designing a system you can come

00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,610
in commonly it goes where you have to

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:35,269
have some sort of identity in your

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:38,149
system for Jengo you simply just use the

00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,830
user model now the Django user model is

00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:42,200
broken because it asks for first and

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,289
last name and this does not work in a

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,029
lot of international communities so you

00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:49,009
have to come up with your own schema and

00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,799
you have to come up with a schema

00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,830
there's as flexible as possible to allow

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:56,720
future changes to allow you to move into

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,179
other markets or other jurisdictions and

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,120
to do it without potentially breaking

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,030
all of your software

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,360
a good idea to think about is making all

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,470
of your systems Unicode aware even if

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,100
you don't think that it will be a

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,990
problem

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,080
making sure that every part of your

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,480
system from the login form to every

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,270
entry on your website to the email so

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,360
that sends out make sure that it formats

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:25,660
names correctly make sure that it

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,870
doesn't man call them because it's very

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:33,309
very very bad when you get an email with

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,080
moji baked instead of a name not only

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,450
does it doesn't make the person roll

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,210
their eyes it also reduces their

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,730
confidence in you as as a website as a

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:48,100
service as a company because you can't

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:51,730
even get their name right this is

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,740
basically it we serve it early which is

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:58,150
good I was gonna have questions in the

00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:02,710
hall but we've got five minutes eight

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:06,160
minutes eight whole minutes which is

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:11,170
good so I might do some Q&A now for Q&A

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:13,530
I'd like to keep it to questions two

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,530
questions

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:23,449
so yes thank you

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,449
[Applause]

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:32,200
although it'll be fine so I have a I

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:35,890
have a quick question I am working well

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,680
oh hello hello rich I'm working with the

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,080
database I didn't design that uses

00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,970
foreign keys quite a bit one of the

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,220
things is it it does is it links people

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,130
records via a foreign key to the

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,360
district that they represent okay yep so

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:55,450
the issue is for whatever reason there

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:59,200
are floating people records in the

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,880
people table yeah what people there are

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,230
floating person records in other words

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,090
they're not linked with a foreign key

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:09,130
okay yes so I'm wondering if there are

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,710
database structures as two strategies

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,240
that you could or have have you ever run

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,600
into that that you could recommend to

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:21,310
avoid what I'm calling floating people

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,130
records right so database integrity

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:29,790
especially when it comes to handling

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:34,680
with people basically yes just a lot of

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,680
verifying things at several stages and

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,910
yeah so when you've got users that have

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,720
incomplete information and they're just

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:47,080
floating it's a good idea to figure out

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,720
how that happened obviously and to

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,690
strengthen your database constraints so

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,480
it can't happen again now there's not

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,030
really a database structure or so that

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:04,450
can stop this it's kind of just

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:06,490
incorrect database integrity but there's

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,830
also the case where for example you

00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:13,090
might have people who represent a

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,280
jurisdiction so you can have that as a

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,870
separate float a separate table that

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,600
links it there so then you move the

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,920
relation over which allows for people to

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,400
represent multiple districts but that's

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,840
probably not a realistic case but

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,060
essentially making sure that your

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,880
database will not allow that to happen

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,280
comes a long way because then when these

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,810
sort of problems come up they sort of

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,750
hard fail instead of suddenly oh no

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,070
a bunch of people don't have don't have

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,640
things that they slip through the gaps

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:46,220
so yes sorry I can't be more helpful

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,960
Android so one of the things you had in

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,780
your earlier slides with the list of

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,810
parts identity was age and date of birth

00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,490
in particular yes I have had promises in

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,470
the past do you have a suggested way of

00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,140
storing age especially in the fuzzy

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,120
sense in databases

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,970
so there's actually something that's

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,610
happened in Australia that does this now

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,990
the to get exactly what is called but

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,310
there is something in the Australian

00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,430
archives where they have multiple

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,830
hundred years of information and they

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:21,410
have come up with a schema that is sort

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:23,810
of very fuzzy for dates of birth so it

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,120
can say for example it can say that this

00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:30,910
person was born on say for example my

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,910
one is December 7th 1993 sorry what

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:40,490
yep-yep say I'm will post a link on

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,380
Twitter to to the talk but basically it

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,360
can do like a day it could say a month

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,150
you can say we know they was born in

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,610
between these dates is born this year he

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,100
was born maybe this year or this range

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,380
of years so there are solutions to this

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:59,960
to a sort of a standard scheme or of of

00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:01,700
encoding very fuzzy dates of birth and I

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,280
mean also there have been cases where

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,530
clerical clerical errors have meant that

00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,990
it also changes in the future so not

00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:11,210
having the read-only is good

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,130
but yes the Sam will be able to hook you

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,710
up with with the talk on that but there

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,630
are there are archivists have had to

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,730
come up with ways of representing

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,520
incomplete dates of birth especially

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,020
when you've got Australian history where

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,790
people were born out in the country and

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,200
they don't know how old they are no one

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,610
knows how old they are but they remember

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,310
that they were born in the spring great

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,400
thank you

00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:39,050
hey do you know a good like third party

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,330
solution that will basically give me an

00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,280
iframe with a bunch of like address

00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:46,130
inputs and name inputs and to give me a

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,310
like user token that I can just pull

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,590
data from whenever I need it

00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,970
not particularly unfortunately I love

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,630
these things you've kind of gotta bake

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:58,060
yourself and it kind of can wrap into

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,400
other identity systems especially ones

00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,140
like authentication systems like

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,750
generally people like bundling their

00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,690
authentication identity with their user

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,830
identity and sort of yeah but

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,480
unfortunately I don't think there's many

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,340
off-the-shelf options I mean the closest

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,600
you guys like Jango but unfortunately

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:19,060
Jango is wrong so it's basically just

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,020
coming up with with a set of things and

00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:23,290
just having to deal with it yourself

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,300
which is unfortunate but as time goes on

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,670
a lot more like web frameworks and

00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,010
things will come with more correct

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,320
things as default so then it's not.you

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,450
reimplemented everything but as of right

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,340
now there is no nice here's a service

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,770
that will take care of of how

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,810
complicated humans are and let me let me

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,180
ask nice questions of it it's maybe a

00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:45,100
good startup idea if you are in Europe

00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,580
because that's the thing that comes up

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:52,450
plenty

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:54,280
I sure question have you seen this

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:57,070
executed well do you have any examples

00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,190
that you think did a good job with this

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:02,320
so I've seen where some things execute

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,380
some things well and then and then they

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,510
also screw up the rest of it so Facebook

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,090
for example does gender pretty well it

00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:12,250
allows you to enter common ones as well

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,050
as custom ones but then they have their

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,870
real name policy where they say that

00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:18,970
people's names in the community for

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,370
example are not valid because they do

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,130
not match their government ID and this

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,110
is commonly commonly comes into play

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,290
when you have people that are acting

00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,090
under a pseudonym or go by another name

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:34,750
that they prefer and Facebook goes all

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,340
no that's not right so Facebook is an

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,840
example of doing one thing correct and

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,690
then doing the other thing horribly

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,040
wrong unfortunately I haven't seen

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,020
anything that universally does

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,060
everything right but I have seen a lot

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,100
of services that do it right in that

00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,560
they don't ask for more information than

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,410
they need to do the exact job that they

00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,560
need to do now when you have things that

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,090
ask for a law load of information there

00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,950
of course going to it probably get

00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,330
something wrong unless they have a very

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,480
diverse team that can think of

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,710
these things but generally they can't

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,970
but the team that designs we don't need

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,460
this information it's completely

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,640
superfluous we can just get rid of it is

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:16,510
less likely to make those mistakes so

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,480
I'd say it's been done done well where

00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,950
people have just not asked and that's

00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,340
probably the best way for a lot of

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,210
things

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,450
Yoruba for dogs doesn't need my gender

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,080
thank you

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,870
yes I think we're still got one minute

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,770
so you one minute you talked about using

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:39,010
addresses for sending mail yes and I'm

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,950
wondering about suggestions for other

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:44,710
uses of addresses like finding people

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:47,290
near you physically in particular the

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,110
balance of asking people versus using

00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:53,020
automated methods so using automated

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,680
methods is almost universally unethical

00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,960
unless if they've opted into it in which

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,730
case you can get away with things such

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,280
as very fuzzy GPS coordinates you can

00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,690
fuzz that and it you know if you use to

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,690
find everyone then just like the house

00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,300
but you can like within a city block so

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,190
generally it's better for that sort of

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,650
Niemi thing to use those sorts of

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,110
coordinates versus an address because

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:23,050
for example in Australia you have some

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:27,010
cases where an address will be a hundred

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,540
acre plot of land and it's like oh yeah

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:32,890
this is just next door and it's like

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:34,870
great but it's 20 Kay's down the road so

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:38,470
yeah it's better to use GPS addresses

00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:41,470
for the near me sort of things but also

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,900
keeping keeping it constrained enough

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,960
that it's not within like 20 or 30

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:49,930
meters just fine cutting things off and

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,720
that's generally more not anonymous but

00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,870
less exactly identifying than addresses

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,060
anyway which also things like müber

00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,710
can't even do right they they sometimes

00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:04,000
like it's very exact but sometimes it's

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:08,020
very unexecuted RS has an own level of

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,910
exactness thank you very much for those

00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,960
people that came out the trek out here

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:15,020
and I'll see you at sprints

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,020
you

00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,430
