Title: Erin Braswell - Python Data Sonification for Science and Discovery - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: Erin Braswell

What do geiger counters, black holes, heart monitors, and volcanoes have in common?  They all can use sound to convey information! This talk will explore using python for sonification: the process of translating data into sound that could otherwise be represented visually. Have you ever wondered how to use python to represent data other than making charts and graphs?  Are you a musician looking for inspiration in the world around you?  This talk will go over how to use python to translate time series data to MIDI that can be played back in real time. We’ll sonically interpret light-curve data from the Kepler space telescope using pygame, MIDIUtil, and astropy, turning points on a graph into a musical masterpiece! Come learn about how data sonification is used to help people, to expand the reach of scientific research, and to create music from data.

hello everyone.welcome and up next we

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,870
have Python data sonification for a

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,600
science and discovery by aaron roswell

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:20,630
please help me welcome her to the stage

00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:30,449
[Applause]

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:33,300
hello thank you for coming so numbers

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,530
really have a story to tell and one of

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,469
the things that I find most interesting

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,180
about that is that a lot of that story

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,379
is really really up to the person who's

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,059
doing the storytelling so it's not those

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,500
numbers themselves but they really can

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,860
be interpreted depending on how you want

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,000
to interpret them so before I was a

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,860
developer which happened relatively

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,770
recently I did a lot of astronomy

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,570
outreach and education and one of the

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,430
things that we did was encourage kids to

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,840
take their own astronomical pictures and

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,900
then process them from start to finish

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,439
so that is everything from taking the

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,189
pictures with the microbes or Batory

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,080
telescopes which of these tiny little

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,299
6-inch telescopes some of them were in

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,390
Arizona some of them in Cambridge

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,049
Massachusetts and then process those

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,630
images just like real data science image

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,640
processors do at NASA so that is

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,610
everything from processing them the

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,490
traditional way which is images that

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,500
were taken with a red filter color them

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,479
red with a green filter color them green

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,009
and with a blue filter colored and blue

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,770
and then put them all together till you

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,070
get a full color image and this image

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,840
was actually taken from the microbes er

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,840
Vittori telescopes and processed by a

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,670
professional image processor and so it's

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,649
really is a lot of finesse it's a lot

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,770
it's not just you know click buttons and

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,450
it happens there's a lot of massaging

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,189
the numbers and massaging the different

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,380
parameters to try to get it to look the

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,210
way that it does so even with you know

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,869
not great data you can still make it

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,520
look really great and so one of the

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,620
things we encourage the kids to do was

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,180
not just do that standard process you

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,730
know

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,070
red-green-blue full-color image have fun

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,230
with it like over process it under

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,730
process that add crazy colors do

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,890
different things with it and it's still

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,660
that exact same data is just displayed

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,450
in a way that you wouldn't really expect

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,130
and in a way that was more personal to

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,630
them so the people who were doing the

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,320
processing and therefore trying to tell

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,870
a story with that so getting to the

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,520
sonification part so a sonification

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,090
really is just a different way of

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,390
exploring that exact same data so

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,900
wikipedia defines sonification as the

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,470
use of non speech audio to convey

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,930
information or perceptual eyes data so

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,510
that's we're gonna be talking about so

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,550
one of the most famous examples of

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,700
sonification is the Geiger counter

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,950
so the Geiger counter what that is is

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,710
essentially it's a tube that's filled

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,450
with gas and that gas has high voltage

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,250
going through it and whenever a

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,940
radioactive particle comes in contact

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,450
with that gas it they get gas conducts

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,800
electricity and that causes ionization

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,050
which is basically just a change in

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,480
electrical charge and that ionization is

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,480
detected by the Geiger counter which

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,280
then emits a little click and also shows

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,500
up on the audio display and that is

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,330
super useful for anyone using it because

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,840
they can get that feedback right in the

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,010
moment they need it and not necessarily

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,100
after the fact you go back to the data

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,930
at the lab and analyze the data and find

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,370
it there or by staring at a display the

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,050
whole time you get the dis but you get

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:57,350
the feedback in real time with audio so

00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:00,030
scientists also study volcanoes and

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,270
volcanoes have a lot of data associated

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,210
with it you have seismic data you have

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,580
emissions data you have GPS data so

00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,860
there's a team in science of scientists

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,380
who studied this particular volcano the

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,040
Sioux Ferrer Hills volcano in Montserrat

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:22,590
and they studied it over a long period

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:25,190
of time and that was between in the 2000

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,940
2005 2007 I think is what it was and

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:33,390
essentially

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:35,550
produced a track a soundtrack for this

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,240
study that had three different types of

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,030
data on it

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
there was a seismic track and that

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,320
measures the number of earthquakes per

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
day and so the greater number of the

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,640
earthquakes the more intense like kind

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,130
of like the bass sound the sulfur

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,110
dioxide track which represents the

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,290
number of tons of sulfur dioxide emitted

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,530
every single day in this study and then

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,020
also GPS data which they basically put

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,640
GPS sensors on the sides of the volcano

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,240
and when they moved apart from each

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,640
other there was a certain sound and when

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,740
they moved towards each other there was

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,660
a different sound so I'm gonna play that

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,310
for you right now see what it sounds

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,420
like

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,420
[Music]

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:42,589
[Music]

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,389
there was a little clip there's a lot

00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,620
more to that it's pretty cool I think it

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,080
Shawna pointed out that it was like the

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,639
the background for a really scary

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,590
volcano movie it's like perfect so

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,050
sometimes sonification can be taken

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:06,060
super literally so this is the black

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:10,650
hole I think it should this is a black

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,720
hole it's in the Perseus cluster and so

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,330
what's going on there is as the black

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,710
hole is sucking things in it has what's

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,930
called an accretion disk of matter

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,360
that's just surrounding that black hole

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,400
and there are also what are called

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,500
relativistic Jets they're just really

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,879
big bursts of energy going out of both

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,699
the North and the South Pole of that

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,400
black hole and because those

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,430
relativistic Jets are so energetic they

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,849
are vibrating the matter in that in that

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,440
accretion disk and that is causing the

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:42,300
accretion disk to make a sound because

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,240
sound is religious vibration passing

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,279
through passing through a medium and so

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:55,229
that particular that particular

00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:58,440
vibration is a tone of b-flat 57 octaves

00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,210
below middle C or a million billion

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,830
times lower than the lowest sound

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,330
audible to the human ear so it's not

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,620
something that we can actually listen to

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,940
but it's something that you could still

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,300
measure and see out there which is

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,300
pretty cool

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,979
so I also in my past job had the

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,779
pleasure of working with an

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,199
astrophysicist named Wanda Diaz Maher

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,120
said and she did a lot of research on

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,520
black holes and stars and forming stars

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,729
but she lost her sight in her early 20s

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,599
and so a big focus of her research has

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:32,039
been how to use data sonification to not

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,690
only help her and other blind

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,759
astronomers but also help other people

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,930
who can see maybe interpret the data

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,139
better and get a little bit of a

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,020
different perspective so she used a lot

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:48,449
of open-source tools and code to turn

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:51,240
data into sound with parameters such as

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:54,610
pitch duration and other properties like

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,490
Direction like panning and also volume

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,669
and so she actually when she was doing

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,610
this study with stellar radio data she

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,500
found that people who were able to see

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,110
the graphs actually were able to detect

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,849
patterns a little more easily when

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,409
listening to the audio and looking at

00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,210
the graph at the same time when you're

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,490
talking about large large large data

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,990
sets and she's actually given a TED talk

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,400
about this and it's super interesting

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,020
you should check it out there's a link

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,650
where you can find out you can watch

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:26,560
that video it's really great so the

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:30,250
other thing that Wanda did was she was

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,409
studying binary stars and so there's a

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,760
white dwarf star and there's a star a

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,250
smaller star around it and they're both

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,169
orbiting around each other and as the

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,599
white dwarf is orbiting because it's

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,300
more massive it actually sucks mass out

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,940
of the other star and that also causes

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,940
radio causes transfer of a lot of energy

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,010
and that causes gamma-ray bursts at a

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,510
regular intervals that are have

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,730
different certain frequencies that are

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,970
kind of in the same in a similar pattern

00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:00,790
so Wanda was translating those

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:05,709
frequencies into pitches and she

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:07,449
actually had it out on her desk and a

00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:10,769
colleague walked in so first before I

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:14,620
continue the story so here's what the

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,459
the sound sounded like just straight

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,459
frequency at a pitch

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:31,220
[Music]

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:43,419
so our colleague walked in and happened

00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,189
to be a jazz musician and recognized

00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:48,489
that rhythm immediately as what's called

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:52,989
the clave a rhythm and so his cousin was

00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:55,389
a jazz jazz composer and he sent that

00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:57,069
essentially transposed it to music

00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,629
notation and sent it off to his cousin

00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,629
and they came up with this

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:28,769
[Music]

00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:30,839
that great so translating more to the

00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,879
code and Python side of things one of

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,100
the most famous I think examples of

00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,589
sonification is listen to wikipedia has

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,869
anyone ever gone to that site and seen

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,609
that it is fantastic and you should

00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:43,709
definitely go check it out

00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:45,839
essentially what it is it's a both a

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,579
sonification and a visualization of what

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,579
is going on at Wikipedia right now and

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,290
it is so cool because it really proves

00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,109
this point that Wikipedia is this living

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,389
breathing ever-evolving document with

00:10:55,109 --> 00:11:00,149
people editing things all over the world

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:02,069
constantly and so whenever someone edits

00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:03,749
a page there's a little dot and also a

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,489
sound associated with it and whenever a

00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:08,999
new user joins there's this really big

00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:10,529
kind of overarching like ah it's really

00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:14,369
cool and I definitely encourage you to

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:17,639
check it out it's really neat so one of

00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:20,669
my roommates and my friend Steve he

00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,039
created a Python library to do this in

00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:25,470
science to do use sonification and

00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,529
science that he was doing so they were

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,929
studying mice and these mice would make

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,160
sounds but they were ultrasonic sounds

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,049
they're really really high note you

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,269
couldn't actually hear them and so they

00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:38,669
originally tried translating the sounds

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,139
down and just trying to play it back

00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:42,029
along with the video of the mice doing

00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,980
things and that didn't work so well

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,509
because it they still couldn't really

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,069
distinguish between the different sounds

00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:49,829
because they were not mice they did not

00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:53,609
understand mice language so what they

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:55,109
did instead was Steve created a library

00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:56,850
that used machine learning to first

00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:58,949
figure out what the different pitches

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,929
that the mice were making were and then

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,519
translate those pitches into sounds that

00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,519
were more easily distinguishable by

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,199
humans so like different notes on a

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,519
scale so that when playing that back

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,739
with the video they could tell exactly

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,089
what the mouse was saying and exactly

00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:16,199
what was going on in the video when that

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,660
happened so with that we're gonna

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,829
translate over to a duper notebook and

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,759
we're going to do some live

00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:27,350
visualizations and also some

00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,350
certifications of that data

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,630
so this notebook is up for anyone to go

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,680
up and use I'll have a link to where you

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,930
can find it later if you're interested

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,930
these first couple cells are really

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:54,329
boring they are just doing some data

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:55,950
processing and some showing like scaling

00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,149
we'll talk about that in a minute but

00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,149
we're gonna start with this one

00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:05,760
so we're gonna start out with some

00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:07,740
really simple data and so we're going to

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,620
just literally just define it as a list

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,450
of tuples and that will show up as a

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,300
scatterplot try to make this a little

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:20,190
smaller so hopefully yeah perfect so the

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,810
other thing okay so with that scatter

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,160
plot without getting into the details of

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,580
what's going on we're just going to play

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:31,049
it

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:31,049
[Music]

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,450
that's a good sign so how exactly are we

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,710
converting those numbers right into

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,470
notes that are being played from the

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,450
graph so we're using something called

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,820
MIDI which stands for a musical

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,130
instrument digital interface and MIDI is

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,330
just amazing it can do so many different

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,610
things across so many different

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,470
applications and so essentially what it

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,790
is is encoded messages that have to do

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:59,920
with pitch timing duration volume pan

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,410
and also can be used to control a wide

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,590
variety of different devices that are

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,030
all being synchronized over MIDI because

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,010
it has like a pretty great clock that

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:14,470
lets you in turn like sync lots of

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:18,370
different things and so at the heart of

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,950
turning numbers into pitches this is big

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:23,980
chart that essentially just has at the

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,360
top it has musical notes and on the

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,960
left-hand side it has the different

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,520
octaves or the different the different

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,020
levels of pitch that it can be for each

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,240
one of those notes and there's a couple

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:38,950
different standards so the one that I am

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,000
using right now is middle C so it's C 60

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,690
I don't know if you can see my cursor

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,370
but this guy right here C 3 which is

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,170
like middle C around the keyboard is set

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:53,800
to the note 2 the number 60 and

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:56,650
everything kind of goes from there so as

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,630
you can imagine Python has so many great

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:02,710
resources for dealing with make cut with

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,750
MIDI and with music and so I found

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,060
something very helpful the Python and

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,270
music wiki which is great it has so much

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,760
information in it if you're interested

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:15,250
so for this talk I'll be using a little

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:19,030
library called sana Phi some code that I

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:21,010
wrote that will take Python essentially

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,950
just a list of tuples or a list of lists

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,320
of tuples for multitrack data and turn

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:31,030
that into MIDI and the main the two main

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,700
components of that are MIDI util which

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,910
is a library that creates MIDI files and

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,550
also playing back that MIDI also with

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,200
Python surprisingly with PI game it's

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,590
not surprisingly since with games you

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,840
want

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,240
soundtrack a lot of time so pygame has a

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:52,390
lot of really great midi functionality

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,340
built into it so since we're in

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,500
Cleveland and since it's the middle of

00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:03,400
NBA playoffs thought it would be good to

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:05,590
take a look at some basketball stats so

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,180
we're gonna take a look at the Cleveland

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:12,460
Cavaliers regular season win percentage

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,910
so first off we're going to load up some

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,610
data and there are some specific points

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,710
in this in this list of tuples to pay

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,390
attention to namely when LeBron joins

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,460
and then when he goes to Miami and then

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:29,560
when he comes back to Cleveland see what

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,850
that sounds like so we'll go ahead and a

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,140
lot of this is behind the scenes if

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,150
you're interested to see how these plots

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,340
are made those functions are defined

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:41,440
earlier up in the notebook they're there

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,980
for you so here we have the graph so we

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,840
see

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,280
LeBron's look rookie year things start

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,260
to do a little better than they do

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,240
really well and then he leaves from

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,220
Miami so it goes down a little bit and

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:57,310
then when he comes back they start doing

00:16:51,220 --> 00:17:00,550
great again so what we're gonna do is a

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:02,500
little bit of processing to get those

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,510
percentages and those numbers into a

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,050
form that we can play back with MIDI and

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:12,310
so the first thing we do is separate out

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:14,740
the X and the y and then so the X can be

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,030
used for the timing and that's just

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,660
going to be the second year in the

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,580
season and the y is going to be that

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,340
note value so we have to scale that

00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:27,250
those original values to be in that

00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:33,460
range that we saw earlier between 0 and

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:34,570
127 and because 0 is pretty low so it's

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,770
a little bit too low for us to hear so

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,160
we're gonna stick in the range between

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:45,160
30 and 127 and then we'll just stick it

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:47,380
all back together and so here is what

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,680
that looks like a lot like our earlier

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,030
graph and then we can go ahead and

00:17:50,680 --> 00:18:01,700
listen to that

00:17:52,030 --> 00:18:01,700
[Music]

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:09,920
so another cool thing you can do with

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,100
MIDI is you can specify certain

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,480
parameters so you can specify what

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,840
instrument you want it to playback with

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,120
so there's a standard there's a standard

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,160
list of all the instruments in what

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,020
program or channel they correspond to

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,930
which are just different parameters on a

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:32,000
MIDI track and you can also with sana

00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,710
Phi you can specify which key you'd like

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,050
to be played back in so essentially what

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,390
that is is we saw that big chart of all

00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,460
of the numbers with a key only some of

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,790
those numbers really matter are the ones

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,490
that are really the important ones and

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:49,460
so for the key of g-major it's all of

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,660
the natural notes plus F sharp so it's

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,250
going to be all those natural notes plus

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,560
F sharp so what is going to do is it's

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,080
going to snap those Y values to the

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,930
closest number that fits within that

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:16,300
particular key so let's see what it

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:19,550
sounds so now we're going to talk about

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,610
climate change data and this is from

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,100
climate gov and this graph essentially

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,140
shows what they call and they have a

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,020
really fancy name for it yearly average

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,210
temperature anomalies so what they do is

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,520
they compare the average temperature of

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,710
both the land in the ocean over the

00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,350
entire 20th century and then compare

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,450
that to every single year in that time

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:46,940
period to see if any particular year was

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:49,790
colder or warmer than that average so

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,800
we're going to open that JSON file it

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,600
was in a JSON file on climate gov which

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:58,570
was fantastic I was so excited about

00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:02,630
that and then do some processing of that

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:06,630
file and come up with a scatterplot

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:10,789
again in that same range between

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:13,490
30 and 127 so he can take a listen to it

00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:27,900
and so let's go ahead

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:27,900
[Music]

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,690
kinda spooky

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,090
so our final data exploration we're

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,950
going to look at some exoplanet data so

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,150
exoplanets are planets that are going

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:48,130
around other stars and so for this

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,530
section all of this is taken from

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,240
another jupiter notebook from a

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,670
fantastic astronomer named Garrett

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,950
Berenson and he goes through all of the

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,390
data analysis in this notebook in a lot

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,460
of detail so if you're interested in

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,110
this particular part of it please take a

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,480
look and go through that notebook it is

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:09,280
so great so what is Kepler doing when it

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,890
gathers data essentially what it's doing

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,840
is gathering data about how bright a

00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,400
star is at any particular time and it

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,560
takes just a lot of pictures of that

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,600
star and what they're looking for is a

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,540
dip in that brainís that is caused by a

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,300
planet going between the telescope and

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:32,470
the star to make it kind of go down in

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:35,530
brightness so what the data file looks

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,810
like is essentially just a measure of

00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:42,250
how bright that star was at a lot of

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:45,930
different time stamps so let's actually

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,930
take a look at one of those star images

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:53,770
that era comes up the first time but it

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:55,270
goes away the second time so so that's

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,780
what that image looks like it's just

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,280
this really little little image and if

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,170
we take a look at the shape of it of

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,590
that entire image file we know that

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,830
there are 926 images and they're all 9

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,910
by 7 pixels so they're really small

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,770
little images and so because Girton has

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,710
already done all of the hard work for us

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,840
we know that the period of brightness

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:23,350
actually repeats in a cycle over a

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,150
period of 0.8 days so we can plot that

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,650
in 0.8 day chunks and we can just see

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,240
what that pattern looks like and so it

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,290
does indeed look like there's a steady

00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,150
brightness and then it did

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:39,160
and then it goes back up and so what

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,830
we're going to do with satify is we're

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,720
going to add each one of those separate

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,390
observations onto the same graph and

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,800
then we'll scale it in the same range so

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:53,380
it makes sense to play back with MIDI

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:57,830
data so here's our exoplanet graph with

00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:13,700
all of those points and so go ahead

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:18,660
[Music]

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,830
kind of chaotic kind of cool so why

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,809
don't we try to clean that up a little

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,000
bit we're going to play each separate

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,290
light curve as a new track and we'll go

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,900
ahead and add the rhythm because why not

00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:32,970
because that's fun so we're going to

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,980
modify this MIDI file in much the same

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:41,010
way that we have done with all of our

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:42,330
other data so the first thing we do is

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,250
separate that out into separate tracks

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,780
so each one of those colors is each one

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,220
of those periods of observation and

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,080
we're going to cut it down only to five

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:54,990
just for a little bit less stuff going

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,669
on and we're going to specify which one

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,820
which instrument we'd like to use for

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:03,240
each one of those original tracks I've

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,919
picked these particular ones and then

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,370
what we're going to do is go ahead and

00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:14,160
add each one of those those tracks to

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:16,770
our MIDI file and while we're at it

00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,290
let's go ahead and get all of the beats

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,450
that are in our MIDI file and add just a

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:29,940
kick drum so the downbeat just to give

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:32,100
it a little bit of a groove so let's

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:49,520
hear what that sounds like

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:49,520
[Music]

00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,910
so where do you go from here if you are

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,180
interested in using MIDI to interpret

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,160
your data as I said before Python has so

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,360
much going on there's so many great

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,730
resources free to use if you would like

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,730
a little list of them you can visit them

00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:16,880
at this URL right here and it also has

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,860
my contact information and lots of other

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,230
stuff and all those of these slides and

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,390
a link to the github repo with all of

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:32,060
the code if you would like to check it

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:34,010
out so it's a tradition in my office to

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,630
write a haiku at the end of your

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,790
presentation that kind of summarizes

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:45,500
everything so here's mine

00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:47,870
here's my cou so thank you so much for

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,110
having me i-is has been a dream come

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,000
true and such a pleasure I don't think I

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,680
have time for questions but if anyone

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,720
would like to talk to me here's my email

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,550
address here's my Twitter and please

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,320
come up and talk to me about music or

00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:03,670
data or astronomy or pretty much

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,670
anything thank you so much

00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,549
