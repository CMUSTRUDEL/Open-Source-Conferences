	Speaker: Paul Vincent Craven

Want to have fun with Python? Do something visual? Get started today? Learn how to draw, animate, and use sprites for games with the [Python Arcade](http://arcade.academy/) library.

"Arcade" is an easy-to-use Python library for creating 2D arcade games. We'll show you how to get started creating your own game, and find plenty of example code to get an idea of what you can do with this library. If you are familiar with PyGame, Arcade is easier, more powerful, and uses recent Python features like type hinting and decorators.

This talk is great for beginners, educators, and people who want to create their own arcade games.
