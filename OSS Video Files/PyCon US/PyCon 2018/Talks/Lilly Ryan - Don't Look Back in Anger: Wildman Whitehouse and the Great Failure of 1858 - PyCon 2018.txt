Title: Lilly Ryan - Don't Look Back in Anger: Wildman Whitehouse and the Great Failure of 1858 - PyCon 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-06
Playlist: Talks
Description: 
	Speaker: Lilly Ryan

In the 1850s, Edward Orange Wildman Whitehouse was appointed the lead engineer of the first attempt to build a trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. With the entire population of two continents waiting for his go-live, their handlebar moustaches aquiver, he demonstrated in fine form just how spectacularly a big project can be a bigger disaster.

This is a tale of long-winded rants, spectacular sideburns, and gentlemen scientists behaving badly. It is also a lesson about the importance of honest reflection in technical teamwork. Lilly outlines some of the mistakes made during one of the biggest tech delivery projects in history, and how a constructive view of failure helped to turn it all around. Through the public meltdowns of Wildman Whitehouse you will learn the importance of feedback, how to handle complex tasks gracefully, and the best way to recover from having your pipeline eaten by a whale.

hey everybody all right welcome back

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,330
from lunch

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,099
this is gonna be Lily Ryan she is a

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,219
penetration tester and recovering

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:23,400
historian from Australia let's give a

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:26,010
hand for her Lily hey folks thank you

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,039
for coming to my talk I can promise you

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,910
lots of drama and backstabbing and

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,469
poetry and useful lessons but before I

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,079
do that I want to talk to you about two

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,670
things one of these is these slide

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,559
changes here which you might not be able

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,620
to see it back but trust me they're

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,610
they're just for fun and because it's a

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,100
bit on theme I've got to Telegraph Keys

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:54,870
one makes the slides go forward and what

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,160
makes the slides go back sure um kids

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,829
you know normal slide clickers weren't

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,859
going to cut it for this talk so okay

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:03,809
the next thing is my slide background

00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:06,000
which is you know kind of subtle here

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,220
but I've done that on purpose this is a

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,770
reproduction of some authentic Victorian

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,020
era wallpaper that probably would have

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,330
been in a rich person's house at about

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,340
the time that my story takes place and

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,640
what I really like about this pattern is

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,920
that if you entered a house that had it

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
your chances of dying would increase

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,479
dramatically because this pattern and a

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,900
lot of others like it were covered in

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,540
arsenic an arsenic would give you these

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,430
really vibrant colors on wallpaper so a

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,409
lot of rich people plastered their

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,520
houses in it and I have color altered

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,950
this one for safety reasons so this

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,689
sample is from a book called shadows

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,939
from the walls of death which was

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,799
published in 1874 and there are only

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,030
four copies of this book left because

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,149
most of them were destroyed in the

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,470
interest of Public Health and I really

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,390
hope the people who digitized that copy

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,740
oh okay anyway this doesn't really have

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,270
anything much to do with the story that

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,619
we're going to hear today but I liked it

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,820
and if you're wondering about a lot of

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,069
the toxic behavior that went on during

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,149
this period just remember that a lot of

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,530
people were literally breathing toxic

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,220
dust over breakfast now

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,330
that I have a little bout

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,290
window-dressing out of the way let's

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,420
move on my name is Lily Ryan my career

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,280
has existed at various points on the

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,290
spectrum between historian and hacker

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,970
and I really like to talk about all of

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,620
the weird things that went down in the

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,569
past so that we can learn something from

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,760
them and I think that being able to

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,459
reflect on the mistakes and the failures

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,870
of the past helps us to build better

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,180
teams in the future and to do better

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,420
work and the story I'm going to tell you

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,310
today is one of the biggest failures in

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:51,420
tech history so I think that successful

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,580
reflection comes in two halves we want

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,580
to understand how we got to where we are

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,519
and then we want to apply those lessons

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,980
to where we're going next and the

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,110
problem is when a team only does the

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,090
first half of this which is what can

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,340
often happen we think about what we did

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,610
we don't take any lessons from it and

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,350
then we do it again and you can get away

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,900
with this for quite a long time if

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,329
things are mostly going well but when

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,209
things go wrong applying these lessons

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,440
to future actions is usually the only

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,220
thing that can pull you out of the bad

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,110
cycle and it's usually when our projects

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,700
fail that they're thrust into the

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:41,030
spotlight even though we would really

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:50,880
rather hide nope come on telegraphed

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:54,030
it's very old all right there we go no

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,150
ways um yes so on the other hand

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,370
besides failing when we succeed it's

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,890
something that usually feels pretty

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,769
awesome one of my favorite things about

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,930
the release of a successful project is

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,180
the go-live celebrations and it doesn't

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,730
matter much to me if this comes in the

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,370
form of an office party or if the teams

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,829
linked off to a bar after work or if you

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,739
even get to have a go live party or any

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,000
celebration at all because you're not

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,039
sitting around waiting for a build

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,070
pipeline to go green and lighting

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,330
candles and probably one of the best go

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,879
live parties on record

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,150
happened in 1858 after the completion of

00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,759
the first transatlantic Telegraph cable

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,530
and to understand why this one telegraph

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,229
cable was such a big deal I need to

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,819
explain what a Telegraph is because it

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,530
is hardware that is so old that it is

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,050
not vulnerable to meltdown or Spectre

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,500
and so most people here probably have

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,000
not used used one probably anyway that's

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,560
a picture of a telegraph receiver these

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,690
are two Telegraph Keys normally you

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,389
would only have the one

00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,360
but basically Telegraph's were the first

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,699
internet in the Victorian era people

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,129
started to send messages to each other

00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,069
along copper wire using basic electrical

00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:10,110
pulses and mostly they would use Morse

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:13,080
code for this this was a system of you

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,280
know short pulses and long pulses that

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,090
correspond it to letters of the alphabet

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,069
so you'd write your message down in you

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,289
know in your alphabet take it to the

00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,020
telegraph office and an operator would

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,120
key it in in Morse and someone at the

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,280
other end would hear your series of long

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,469
and short pulses as little clicks and

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,759
they'd write that down back in letters

00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:35,490
for the person who was meant to receive

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,250
it it was better than normal mail

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,599
because electricity can travel much

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,729
faster than trains or horses

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:46,139
so telegraph messages got to their

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:48,569
recipients much faster and by 1858 North

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,699
America and Britain had had nationwide

00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:52,680
telegraph systems for a few decades and

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,099
this was how most people domestically

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,250
did business but to send a message from

00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,810
Britain to North America or vice versa

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,300
at this same period of time it would

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,039
take several weeks because you had to

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,770
put it on a ship and literally sail it

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,740
across the Atlantic Ocean and this was

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,509
why when the world heard that there was

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,090
now a telegraph cable that could connect

00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:17,210
the two continents they went absolutely

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:21,060
wild for it

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:24,240
the 1858 Telegraph cables completion was

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,669
one of the most spectacular go lives in

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,069
history on the both sides of the

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,810
Atlantic people fired cannons and a lot

00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:33,330
of fireworks and they danced in the

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,000
streets and they wrote reams and reams

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,319
of some of the worst poetry I have ever

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,770
heard yes son

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,680
tis done the angry sea can sense the

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,990
nation's stand no more apart with class

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,050
bird hands the continents feel the

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,059
throbbing of each other's hearts

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,999
speed speed the cable let it run a

00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:59,669
loving girdle round the earth till all

00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:03,479
the nations Neath the Sun shall be as

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,839
brothers of one half machine that rhymed

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,839
back in the day but okay there is heaps

00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,569
more where that came from like a lot and

00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,580
I guess my point in telling you this is

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,610
people really really love to this cable

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,749
they loved it so much that they were

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,419
still celebrating three weeks later but

00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:26,369
the weeks of party hit a snag when a

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:31,139
cool new Telegraph cable went completely

00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:33,270
dead so these days when a big release

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,550
goes bad we usually have strategies in

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,789
place we don't always assume that things

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,319
are gonna work we hope they will but we

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:43,139
plan for the worst we might have thought

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,269
of a way to to roll the changes back or

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,669
we plan a soft launch just to make sure

00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:49,499
that things are really working but the

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:52,830
telegraph guys they haven't thought of

00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:55,349
anything except success there was no

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:59,189
fallback plan there was just lots and

00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:04,709
lots of rage and when the first person

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:06,229
who wants to use your Telegraph is the

00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,509
Queen

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:14,729
it's a bit of a stakeholder you really

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:17,699
feel the heat when things go wrong so

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:20,669
this project literally was gonna change

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,019
the world we feel often that our

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,369
projects are going to change the world

00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,619
we like to feel like that and sometimes

00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:28,349
they do you know we change people's

00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,999
lives all the time by rolling out stuff

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,469
to make sure that the people who trust

00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:34,199
us with their business can do the things

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,689
that they need to do but this project

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:38,159
this transatlantic Telegraph project was

00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:42,000
going to change the world in a really

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,459
huge and history-making way like the

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,240
invention of the car or the internet or

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:50,510
Janelle monáe's dirty computer album

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,340
this kind of makes all the fireworks and

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,340
yeah

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:58,310
and the dancing understandable from a

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,640
Victorian perspective I do not find the

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:05,750
poetry understandable but we can put

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,340
that one aside but I would also I hope

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,890
this demonstrates how dramatic it got

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:14,150
when this amazing cable just totally

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,550
died because it's always a hard time

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,020
when a project fails and a lot of us

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,970
have experienced this at one time or

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,310
another if you haven't you almost

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,770
certainly will no matter how a excellent

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,900
the team is or how good the idea is not

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,690
everything is going to go smoothly but

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,940
failures are also very valuable for me

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,610
they have been the places where I have

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,230
learned the most about myself and have

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,120
gotten the most valuable feedback about

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,660
myself as a team player

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,340
my technical strengths and the ability

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,950
of me and my team to bounce back when

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,510
things go wrong and I think that

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,120
reflecting on your work is often richer

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:53,150
after a failure asking yourself and your

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:58,040
team what did we learn gives us really

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,570
useful fuel for moving on unfortunately

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,520
for the transatlantic Telegraph cable

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:06,770
team 1858 was only 15 years after the

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,840
first computer program was written and

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,650
it was 48 years before the first

00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:16,040
computer was built yes and that's not

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,350
wrong it was a time when the phrase

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,330
agile retrospective would only ever be

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,790
used to describe someone peeping over

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,760
their shoulder as they sprinted down an

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,950
alleyway looking for badness so they

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,280
really didn't have any models to learn

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:33,080
from but this doesn't mean that we can't

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,090
still learn something from this project

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,580
which was one of the biggest tech

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,160
delivery failures in history because in

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,140
many ways this project formed the

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,470
cornerstone of every modern delivery

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,760
project and the key person that we're

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,710
going to learn these lessons from is

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,220
this guy this is dr. Edward orange

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,750
Wildmon Whitehouse and in addition to

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,810
having the best name in the wildest

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,030
facial hair of his entire team he was

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,950
also the chief electrician of this

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,980
transatlantic Telegraph project this is

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:06,130
basically the tech lead he was also the

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,020
main architect of its demise

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,750
Whitehouse had a history as a doctor and

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,430
a scientist and an inventor when I did

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,170
the research for this I found a patent

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,840
that he'd lodged for some rollerskates

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,730
which could have been interesting and he

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,880
dabbled in telegraphy as one of his side

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,830
projects and he'd also patented a number

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,080
of deviations on Telegraph technology

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,640
which you know in those days that was

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,350
basically like forking other people's

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,760
repos and changing a single line and

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,560
then calling it all his own work anyway

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,850
this had impressed Cyrus field who was

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,440
this American businessman who was

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,740
providing all the money for this big

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,840
Telegraph project and so despite the

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,390
fact that White House had no actual

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,430
experience with implementing telegraph

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,590
systems he got appointed chief

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,220
electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,530
Company the main problem with the

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,150
transatlantic Telegraph cable was that

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,190
nobody was really sure if it could

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,390
actually be done you know we'd had

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,880
Telegraph's for a while

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:07,340
but we'd never had something that went

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,170
underwater unbroken for such a long way

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,050
this was a continuous cable it had to be

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,430
about 2,000 miles long felt about as

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,460
impossible as building a space elevator

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,470
to the moon and at the time scientists

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,940
were still discovering some of the basic

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,460
laws of physics that we take for granted

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,920
today electric currents were being used

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,630
for a lot of stuff in 1858 but

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,880
electricity still wasn't understood very

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,310
well and this meant that a lot of the

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,800
ideas that people had for how to run an

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,960
electric pulse along a cable for a long

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,780
distance were they were literally just

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,120
guesses and the only way to prove or

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,680
disprove this theory was to build the

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,850
thing which was going to be very

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,700
expensive so but fortunately Cyrus field

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:52,670
was very rich and he was very ignorant

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,010
and had no idea how impossible this was

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,870
supposed to be so he went ahead and kind

00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,500
of Elon Musk Ashley hired a team to get

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,390
it done one of the other people that

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,950
field hired to be on the board of his

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,630
Atlantic telegraph company was this

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,510
young man whose name was William

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,100
Thompson he had fewer cool names and

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,140
fewer credentials than Whitehouse at

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,540
this point in time but he was also a

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,040
keen physicist with some interesting new

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,010
ideas about how electrical currents

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,910
worked cyrus field had discovered

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,680
Thompson

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,030
after he wrote a bunch of proposals for

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,550
how to build the telegraph cable he's

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,490
basically reddit troll and field liked

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,110
his spirit so he hired the guy and when

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,260
White House met Thompson

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,540
it was rivalry at first sight White

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,400
House was used to being listened to and

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,310
Thompson was younger than him and

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,020
questioning his authority and Thompson

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,430
had his own measure of respect with the

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,960
board and his facial hair wasn't as good

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,270
cooler later in life he would grow a

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,890
beard so magnificent that it would make

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:58,040
a hipster weep to see it it's pretty

00:13:51,890 --> 00:14:00,200
cool I think so anyway the main point of

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,390
contention about how to build this thing

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,490
was how the cables themselves were going

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,900
to be constructed they needed to be

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,520
designed so that they could hold up to

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,330
the distance that they had to cover and

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,340
still carry a signal White House argued

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,960
that the copper that was used to conduct

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,120
her signals should have a small diameter

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,850
but did the voltage that was used to

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,060
carry that signal should be very strong

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:26,150
kind of like yelling the current across

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,680
the distance between the two oceans and

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,600
it also decided that the cable should be

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,710
very heavy so that it would sink to the

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,580
ocean floor and it wouldn't move about

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,810
and it would be fine

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,310
stay there and Thompson disagreed with

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,680
him about pretty much everything I just

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,840
said but White House was confident that

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,850
he was right and he was more senior and

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,440
refused to hear any of Thompson's ideas

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,880
and there wasn't much time to persuade

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,200
stubborn people like White House that

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,720
there were other points of view besides

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,120
his because Cyrus field and the board

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,530
also wanted this project to be completed

00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
as soon as possible because they'd

00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,370
gotten all their investors really

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,980
excited and also most of the people in

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,870
England in America and that's a lot of

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,140
people and they wanted it delivered

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,330
yesterday so they rushed out this cable

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,670
using White House's design the way they

00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,970
did this they stuck two halves one on

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,650
each two ships one half on each ship one

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,120
of these ships was gonna spool the cable

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,190
out from across the sea from

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,420
Newfoundland and the other ship was

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,280
going to do the same from Western

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,710
Ireland and the idea was that they would

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,150
sail across the sea spooling cable out

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,589
behind them they would meet in the

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,640
middle join up the cable and hey you've

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,640
got a working telegraph line

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,540
but yeah not didn't walk out like that

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,459
this picture shows how they loaded the

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,959
cables into the ships they basically

00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,699
made a little bridge to roll them along

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,129
because the cables weighed about an

00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:49,189
imperial ton a mile so they couldn't

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:52,040
just be carried and Whitehouse's health

00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:53,929
at this time wasn't so good so this

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,610
meant that Thompson was the one who had

00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,920
to get on the ship and actually go and

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,779
carry Whitehouse's cable across the sea

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,819
and spool it across the Atlantic Ocean

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,949
so he had to oversee the whole thing

00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:06,559
Whitehouse remained on shore and waited

00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:09,439
and the first attempt was a total

00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,660
disaster after about three days the

00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:13,189
incredibly expensive cable snapped under

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,149
its own weight and sank to the bottom of

00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:19,249
the ocean and was lost forever

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,470
so field went and made his excuses to

00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:23,029
the investors he got some more money to

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,850
build a replacement cable which is what

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,410
they're doing in this picture in this

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,389
one there they're covering the cables

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,480
with a layer of what they called goto

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,189
purcha which was a tree sap it is a tree

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,019
sap that could be molded soft and then

00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:37,790
it would harden like plastic this was

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,800
before plastic had been invented

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,050
so the Victorians used to purchase for

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,999
everything to the point where the tree

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,420
nearly went extinct and then they

00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:48,429
invented plastic and that saved the tree

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,129
whether it saved the world

00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:55,339
anyway after about a year of very

00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,749
expensive cable making the new cable was

00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:59,389
ready they put it on the ships and they

00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:01,009
set out again but this time the idea was

00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:02,779
that the two ships would start in the

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:05,569
middle of the Atlantic and they would go

00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:08,179
towards the coast from there and it took

00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,880
them three more tries meeting in the

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,329
middle and sailing out again and every

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,069
single time the cable snapped in sack

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,079
and at one point the cable was almost

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,459
completely destroyed by passing well as

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,209
you can see here this is the original

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,209
fail whale

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,659
but by the fourth attempts they had made

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,549
it the whole way across without the

00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:34,169
cable breaking and it was connected to

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,480
the local Telegraph networks at both

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:39,299
ends and declared ready for business

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,070
and this was the point where the entire

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,659
Western world went completely wild and

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,960
they kicked off that go live party that

00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:47,760
we talked about earlier this was also

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,440
where wildmen Whitehouse sealed his own

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,140
fate

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:55,169
he and Thompson had argued over how the

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,309
cable had been designed and now they

00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,190
were fighting over how it should be

00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,419
operated because as I said earlier White

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,610
House had designed the system to

00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:05,370
generate a very strong current along the

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,380
entire length of the line and Thompson

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,260
had managed to get in to put some brakes

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,940
on the voltage of that and so that had

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,289
worked the system wasn't generating

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,240
nearly as much power as it could which

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,029
actually in terms of physics is better

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,399
but they didn't know about at that point

00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,440
but as the week's went on demand for the

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,240
Telegraph grew and grew it's like the

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,830
only line and you would have to send one

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,169
message at a time across the line so

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,380
there are messages backing up at both

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,779
ends of the line from entire continents

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:37,380
so White House thinking you know

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,500
fiddling and waiting decided to increase

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,190
the voltage as high as you can make it

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:47,190
in prod without telling anyone his

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,470
expectation was that the stronger the

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,940
current the faster and clear the

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,059
messages would get to the other end of

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,070
the line the reality was that this

00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,500
amount of voltage completely fried the

00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,940
extremely expensive cables he'd

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,289
overwhelmed them with power which meant

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,510
that they had short-circuited into the

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:07,620
sea and some nearby sharks had boiled

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,419
fish for dinner so the upshot of White

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,659
House's secret tinkering with the system

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,760
meant that his famous cable was

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:17,220
completely dead within three weeks of

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,250
going live and the world was very angry

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,720
and so was cyrus field and so is the

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,490
entire board of the atlantic telegraph

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,440
company because they literally had one

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:30,450
job was in the name and managed to do it

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,090
this is about as pretty much as bigger

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,010
disaster as if the entire internet had

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,580
gone down and they didn't know if they

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,580
were going to get it

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,840
when a project fails this spectacularly

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,180
and when this much money is involved

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,310
there's usually a lot of public head

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,400
scratching and soul-searching about what

00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,810
went wrong and where it went wrong

00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,490
questions get asked and as you'd

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,350
probably expect the best companies will

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,750
take some time out to step back and

00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,340
reflect on what's happened and see what

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,490
lessons they can learn to make it better

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,080
and while most of the board of the

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,320
Atlantic Telegraph company were doing

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,840
this the one man who wasn't was Edward

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,220
orange Waldman Whitehouse because he had

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
skipped right across that period of

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,440
reflection and right into blame which is

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,020
a pit that it's unfortunately very easy

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,090
to fall into he didn't want to reflect

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,770
because he knew whose fault it was

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:27,930
everybody else's except for him and the

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:31,530
public was so angry with the failure of

00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,330
this cable that it demanded and it got a

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,160
public inquiry into the whole project

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,870
this was one of the first project

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,840
retrospectives that took place in front

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:42,570
of an entire country during this inquiry

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,090
William Thompson testified to the reams

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,310
of his advice that had been ignored by

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,500
the chief electrician and others stepped

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,330
in to testify to the fact that they had

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,250
seen the chief electrician messing with

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,170
the voltage levels on the cable in the

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,790
weeks after its completion which was

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,010
completely against what the board had

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,400
decided to do and against all known

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,640
scientific advice so getting feedback

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,060
like this always a bit of a blow

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,580
especially when you thought you were

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,340
doing a good job and getting feedback

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,720
like this publicly is even harder

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,150
because it's natural to get defensive

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,760
when this happens and honestly public

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,460
feedback about specific individuals is

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,670
not usually a great idea but that's what

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,930
happened and it's not usually a great

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,100
idea because it often leads to

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,990
situations like what followed after this

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,960
White House hadn't entered into this

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,340
inquiry with an open mind but honestly

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,130
he hadn't entered into the entire

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,900
project with an open mind he was a self

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,930
righteous Victorian era gentleman and

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,850
scientist and a doctor and a member of

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,800
the Royal Society and he was used to

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,620
being treated as though that meant he

00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,420
could do whatever he wanted and

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,520
fortunately for White House there was no

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,280
software development community in 1858

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,520
to suggest to him how he might tactfully

00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,590
handle that situation so he did what an

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,050
angry self-righteous Victorian era

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,850
gentleman scientist would do he

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,180
published a pamphlet about the whole

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:12,350
affair and then he sent it to all the

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,210
papers and he had it published there too

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,640
the pamphlet was called the Atlantic

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,250
Telegraph but a better title might have

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,090
been everyone is wrong except me the

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,890
greatest scientist in the world I could

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,540
describe what was in it but I'm gonna

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,950
let White House speak for himself here

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:34,380
because it's better the charges leveled

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,120
against my ignorant on the suspicion are

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:41,130
three three of the most derogatory and

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,130
detrimental not merely to the fame of a

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:47,610
public but to the character of a private

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:51,360
man in the one case however error is but

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:54,090
human in the other disgrace from the

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,490
first my advice and wishes as projector

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,679
had been disregarded and overruled and

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,260
as an officer I had constantly been

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,720
thwarted and obstructed in my operations

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,300
I do not shrink therefore from the

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,820
avowal that accustomed to such treatment

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,980
and aware of the incompetence and

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,340
division of counsel existing on the

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,440
board I decided to do my best on my own

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,460
responsibility to save the enterprise

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,929
from destruction

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,230
I make no appeal ad ms record him I seek

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:26,220
for no sympathy on scientific grounds

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,350
sufficient for me that I have been

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,020
identified and from the first with that

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,000
prodigy of this age which may become a

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,720
new starting point in history until the

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,460
end of time a great responsibility rests

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,990
upon those who have in any way

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,360
contributed to the failure of this

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,640
enterprise but for my own part I can

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,580
safely say that neither zeal the labor

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,740
caution of nor anxiety was wanting upon

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,510
the part of Edward orange Waltman white

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,510
house and then he signed it

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,539
it may surprise you to learn that

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,370
publishing this pamphlet did not really

00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:05,679
convince anyone that the failure of the

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,340
Telegraph cable was not somehow his

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,080
fault and I narrated certainly convinced

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,000
lots of people that whether or not the

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,320
cable had been ruined because of White

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,850
House's failure to listen to anybody

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,500
else they sure as hell did not want to

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:22,179
work with that guy and after this he was

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,919
unasked to be chief electrician of the

00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:25,059
atlantic telegraph company which was

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,610
fine by him because he didn't want to

00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:29,260
work with them anyway and then he folded

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,940
his arms and he stormed off to his room

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,919
or something unfortunately I have seen

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,440
many projects even in this day and age

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,419
and just that way and this is a real

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,309
shame because in 1858 it was already

00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:45,549
obvious that this was a really bad way

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:46,899
to run a team there are a few things I

00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,460
want to highlight out of this Telegraph

00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:52,659
cable affair that I think are pretty

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:55,450
important firstly open-mindedness among

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,659
your team is crucial to success but it

00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,519
is also crucial to good failure

00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,809
constructive reflection can't happen if

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,850
there are members of your team who

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,830
aren't open to being challenged or

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,750
having their minds changed even by

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,750
people who are considered junior to them

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,909
secondly if the project gets to the

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,769
point that things are really bad

00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:21,809
feedback should be given sensitively and

00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:23,740
with tact and most importantly privately

00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,909
people are naturally going to get

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,010
defensive if they think that they're

00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,419
being attacked especially if they think

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:33,130
that they are having their value

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:34,779
challenged in public thirdly in order to

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,279
be effective retrospective should always

00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:38,470
follow the prime directive which is this

00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,389
one here regardless of what we discover

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,100
we understand and truly believe that

00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:44,440
everyone did the best job they could

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,000
given what they knew at the time their

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,029
skills and abilities the resources

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,169
available and the situation at hand

00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,970
having something like this to guide a

00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,309
retrospective session creates a safe

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,350
space for reflection where people can

00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,630
openly discuss failures without fear of

00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,269
blame it's also a good reminder for

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,789
anyone in the retro that blame is not

00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:05,139
appropriate I like to print this one out

00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:07,210
and put it on a wall before a start of a

00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:11,950
retro I find it can really help

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:13,870
it might help you to and finally there

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,179
is no room for hero behavior in a strong

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,830
team the story of the first

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:19,870
transatlantic Telegraph cable project

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,970
might have been very different if that

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,820
team didn't include Wildmon Whitehouse

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,440
and while there were definitely problems

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,360
with the way that the inquiry after the

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,340
failure of the cable was handled they

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,690
may not have even needed an inquiry if

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,289
they had appointed someone else to be

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:37,840
chief electrician instead one of the

00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:41,110
strongest findings of the inquiry was

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,090
that White House's behavior was a real

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,159
problem and most particularly his

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,409
inability to listen to anybody else and

00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,090
his tendency to run off his own run off

00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:52,770
on his own and make crucial changes to

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:54,610
this project without telling anyone else

00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,460
occasionally you will get people on

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,049
teams who want to be seen as heroes

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,390
because our culture often romanticizes

00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,570
this idea of someone who swoops in and

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:08,049
saves the day right at the end and all

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,580
this is really cool if you're Batman but

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,020
if you've ever watched a Batman movie

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,970
you'll see how many innocent people get

00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,559
their legs broken and how many buildings

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,659
get completely destroyed while he's

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,130
chasing after a bad guy and the same

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:20,440
thing happens with heroes on projects

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,360
they might get some personal glory once

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,770
it's done but the team members who ended

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,690
up with bits of smashed building

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,000
crushing their parked cars I'm not gonna

00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,350
remember that person very fondly and

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,529
they probably won't want to work with

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:34,480
them again this makes for a terrible

00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:39,399
team environment and we all know that

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,990
unhappy teams do not do good work here

00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,450
is a quick recap of all of that in case

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,159
you missed any of it firstly

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,470
open-mindedness is crucial secondly

00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:50,049
treat feedback sensitively thirdly

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:55,840
remember the prime directive and fourth

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:57,820
there's no room for Heroes so with the

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,340
moral of this story over you might be

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,570
wondering what happened to the Telegraph

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,779
cable project after the dramatic

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,159
pamphlet incident and you'll be pleased

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,140
to learn that the Atlantic Telegraph

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,210
Company learned something about teamwork

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,710
from their first iteration they

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,730
appointed William Thompson as the chief

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,039
electrician this was great because in

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,200
addition to having far more solid ideas

00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,509
about physics than his predecessor he

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,209
was all

00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:24,529
but also nice it'll work with and he

00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:27,320
knew how to treat his team with respect

00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:29,179
and at this point the Western world's

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,059
demand for a transatlantic Telegraph

00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:33,709
cable was so large and at this point the

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:35,899
Atlantic Telegraph Company had had so

00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:38,419
much experience laying cable out at sea

00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:42,199
that they didn't have that much problem

00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:44,269
getting money to try again this time

00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:46,309
they built the cables the exact opposite

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:48,559
of white houses they were large in

00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,789
diameter not quite so heavy so they

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,199
could be a little flexible in the sea

00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:53,209
currents and hopefully wouldn't cause

00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:55,069
themselves to snap and they used a

00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:57,829
comparatively tiny amount of voltage to

00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:59,329
power them and then they put them on the

00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:01,419
boat and they went out to sea and they

00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:04,159
sailed off and the cable snapped again

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:06,949
but because they had been through this

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,929
so many times by now Thompson and his

00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:11,629
crew knew enough that they were able to

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:14,539
fish that cable back up from the ocean

00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:17,479
floor and repair it and they went back

00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:19,190
for a second cable and by that time a

00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:21,109
second cable had reached both coasts

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,959
they hooked the repaired first one up to

00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:26,449
and then they had two working telegraph

00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:28,969
lines across the Atlantic and they

00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:30,919
actually worked and after they had

00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:34,429
tested it to make sure that it really

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,139
really really worked then the whole

00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:38,749
Western world had another wild go live

00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:40,639
party and eventually they laid undersea

00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:42,409
telephone lines and even more eventually

00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:45,679
they were undersea fiber-optic cables

00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:47,179
and video chat and cat gifts and we all

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,059
lived happily ever after

00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:52,059
in an interconnected world the end

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,919
let's give it Lily one last round of

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,919
applause

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,570
