hello if I can have your attention

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,160
presenting the talk today by the numbers

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,750
Python community trends in 2017 or 2018

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:23,609
please give a warm welcome to Dimitri

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:25,890
and Eva great welcome to our talk my

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,990
name is Eva jad Laska I am the director

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,599
of operations of the Python Software

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,309
Foundation which is also known as the

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,410
PSF for short you probably might hear

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,059
that around if you'd like to know more

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,600
about the PSF i'd be happy to answer

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,670
questions after the talk in the hallway

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,559
you are also welcome to approach me

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,629
throughout the conference at any time to

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,420
ask any questions or make any comments I

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,980
do oversee this entire conference so it

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,930
does happen from time to time that I

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,149
look like I'm in a terrible rush and if

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,260
that does happen feel free to send me an

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,079
email or ping me on Twitter hello

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,530
everyone welcome I'm very excited today

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,540
to talk about Python community trends in

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,130
2017-2018 together with Eva my name is

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,090
Dmitry Filippo and I'm product marketing

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,830
manager at JetBrains

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,930
and I was the main person on the JED

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,850
brain side behind the Python developer

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,729
survey which we conducted together with

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,740
Python sphere for nation at the end of

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,450
the last year our today's talk is going

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,180
primarily focused on the results of that

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,189
survey however we want to go beyond just

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,869
that to talk about other topics which

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,049
were not covered by the survey itself

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,670
for example Eve is gonna talk about

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,049
patents jobs market and various

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,280
opportunities for Python developers

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,590
available out there

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,170
I also hope our today's talk is going to

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,390
be interactive so don't be shy and feel

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,600
free to raise your hands once we conduct

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,890
very simple polls during our talk we're

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
also looking forward to your feedback

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,259
ideas and suggestions so we can make our

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,479
survey even better next time we run it

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,520
with that let me pass it to Eva to talk

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,719
about how we came up with an idea to run

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,790
this survey Thanks so it's important to

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,250
start with a brief description on why we

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,009
did the Python developer survey up until

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,080
our 2017 survey there hasn't been an

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,150
unbiased survey strictly focused on

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,990
Python developers and we wanted to

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,150
change that

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,880
additionally we wanted to identify the

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,160
latest trends in Python and also gather

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,100
insight on how the Python development

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,300
world looks today we have our benchmark

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,890
now in all future surveys will show us

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,550
trends over time which can be a useful

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,660
tool for our community what question the

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,750
questions that we set out to answer

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,740
include what's the current Python 3

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:44,100
adoption rate how is Python used with

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,550
other languages what kinds of projects

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,330
is Python used for what are the major

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,340
types of development among Python users

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,310
what are the most popular technologies

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,050
and tools which frameworks and libraries

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,690
are most common and how do they

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,820
complement each other and in general we

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,820
wanted to see who Python developers were

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,090
JetBrains was a great resource

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,490
throughout the process for those of you

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,220
that know the PSF is a non-profit and we

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,900
do run aslim operation so JetBrains

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,810
there they were able to host the survey

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,820
they set up the logic and they analyzed

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,630
the results

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,240
additionally they provided their

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,150
services of their awesome design team to

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,060
create the results webpage that we have

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,190
showing the results they even supplied

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,430
the prizes for the raffle winners for

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,860
those that participated in our survey

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,500
the PSF on the other hand was in charge

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,490
of sending out the survey links via our

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,560
channels so we shared the survey via PSF

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:51,600
mailing lists our LinkedIn and Twitter

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:56,160
the Python org website the PSF blog and

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,960
slack and also via read the docs for the

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:04,020
next survey I plan on doing a lot more

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:06,680
outreach to user groups worldwide the

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,900
majority of the responses for the survey

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,710
62% of them came from the banners on

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,190
Python org other major sources were the

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,859
PSF blog and Twitter posts no product

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,780
service or vendor related channels were

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,540
used in order to prevent the survey

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,070
results from being slanted in favor of

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,070
any specific tool or technology

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,830
the next few slides will pertain to

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,389
Python to the Python developer profile

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,000
our survey results showed us that our

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,900
community is diverse in demographics and

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,660
experience the age range varied amongst

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,280
the respondents but we did find that one

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,790
in two respondents were between the ages

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,660
of 18 and 29 and one in four were

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,889
between the ages of 30 and 39 we did see

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,780
that a large amount of younger

00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,419
respondents came from outside of the US

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,790
and that the US has more experienced

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:07,380
Python uses the map here shows shows us

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,400
that respondents came from all over the

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,410
world more than 150 countries the

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,140
countries in blue indicate a high

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,320
response rate the area is marked in

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,419
black account for 33 percent of the

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,130
respondents of the survey but when

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,410
looking at the individual countries that

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,430
make up that 33 percent we can see that

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,990
the response rate was low per country

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,630
after the survey when I compared this

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,030
map to the countries that the PSF has

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,830
given financial grants out to recently I

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,350
can see that we need to do a better job

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,840
promoting our next survey in the African

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,120
continent there's lots of Python

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,460
activity there that wasn't captured by

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,340
our first survey especially considering

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54,479
that 25% of the PSFS financial grants

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,940
went to Africa in 2017 we have made a

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,780
note for that for next time and we plan

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,120
on improving our outreach there the

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,780
Python survey respondents report a wide

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,360
range of experience 22% have less than

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,580
one year of experience and that same

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,770
percentage has more than 11 years of

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,080
experience and there's a smooth

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,580
distribution in the middle that

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,560
indicates that there's a good balance

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,840
between newcomers and experienced

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,190
developers making Python a sustainable

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,970
language when it comes to working in

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,610
groups versus alone in our survey 56% of

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,270
Python developers say they work on

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:40,010
projects independently and 40% work on

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,720
teams usually of 2 to 7 people

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,389
about half of the respondents work on

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,790
one main project with a handful of side

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:53,160
projects and a quarter focus on one

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:56,190
project at a time next up let us look at

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,410
Python job opportunities our survey only

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,419
asked two questions pertaining to jobs

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,460
but we thought it was worth exploring

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:06,300
more and mentioning for two reasons the

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,970
first is since we can see how popular

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,070
Python has grown we wanted to see how

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,800
that related to the job market at this

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,990
point in time since we are going to

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,580
continue this survey yearly it will be

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,370
good historical context for us

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,919
especially for future comparisons the

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,660
second reason is we can see many of the

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,460
respondents are somewhat new to the

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,010
industry so perhaps this can provide

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,280
some insight and guidance for them when

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,680
looking for work from our survey we did

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,500
learn that the majority of respondents

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,260
are fully employed after doing more

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,120
research we found out that in the US

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,310
there are slightly less students and

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,830
more employed people in comparison to

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,020
the rest of the world whereas the US has

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:53,669
slightly less students when compared to

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:56,430
the rest of the world with that in mind

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,010
I checked out indeed comm actually

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,750
yesterday to see what the what that

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,789
currently meant for those looking for

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,810
jobs either first time employment or

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:08,970
looking to switch in the US based on the

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,510
job listings posted the salary of a

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:15,810
Python developer can range anywhere from

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:17,460
$85,000 to 130,000 in the US and that

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,490
can vary based on the location and

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,349
experience level majority of the

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,630
listings were for full-time positions

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:26,430
and the second highest category of

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,639
employment type were for contract

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,039
positions when it comes to job locations

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,560
I was actually surprised to see that New

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,620
York City was the highest postings for

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,529
job developers with 35% of the jobs

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,570
followed by Seattle Austin and San

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:47,790
Francisco to give an idea of which

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,810
non-us countries have Python developers

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,790
looking for jobs

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,830
I collected traffic information from

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,220
jobs Python org use

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,260
unique pageviews even though our site is

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,420
trivial in comparison to the large job

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,230
sites it does tell us that there is

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,510
worldwide demand for Python jobs if we

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,060
look at the graph here we can see that

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,170
the largest traffic counts in 2016 and

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,960
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:18,050
not counting the u.s. came from India

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:22,020
China the United Kingdom Brazil Canada

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:24,360
Germany and Russia what I want to

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,030
underline even more so is the increased

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,180
traffic in 2017 for some of the

00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:34,500
countries like Brazil going from 684

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:37,440
unique pageviews to 4546 that's a huge

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,380
increase in one year China's traffic

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,490
almost doubled between 2016 and 2017

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,800
India's traffic increased by 70% in 2017

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,630
I'm happy to know that pythons

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,420
popularity is growing in this country in

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,130
these countries and as a side note for

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,800
those that are interested tomorrow at 10

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,300
a.m. there is a job fair here at PyCon

00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,970
which is down the hall in the big hall

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,770
and it is open to everyone here if

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,270
you're looking for a new endeavor be

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,460
sure to bring your business cards and

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,440
resumes with you that's so great

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,970
so now let's start looking into how

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,160
Python is actually being used by the

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,740
Python community with a survey we

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,470
identified that four out of five Python

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,900
developers use it as their main language

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,060
there's a 4% increase comparing to

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,700
seventy-five percent when JetBrains did

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,920
its own survey in 2016

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,900
various recent studies also show that

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,850
the number of Python developers as well

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,740
as a share of Python developers using it

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,900
as their main language is growing

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,290
steadily a year by year this can be

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,940
explained by a rapidly growing number of

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,460
Python developers using data science

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,800
this segment of users is growing faster

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,300
than others if we look into the

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,370
languages used together with Python

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,100
where Python is the main language in use

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,760
half of Python users also use javascript

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,370
javascript is used by 79% of users

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,980
identified as web developers but only by

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,680
39% of those involved in data analysis

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,000
or machine learning the breakdown is

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,139
slightly different for those who use

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,749
Python as their secondary language

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,509
as fewer of them use JavaScript but many

00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:15,160
more languages such as C and C++ Java

00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:16,749
and c-sharp to identify the most popular

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,639
types of Python development and their

00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:21,309
intersections we asked two similar

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,290
questions or do you use Python for with

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:25,149
multiple answers aloud and what do you

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,139
use Python for the most with only single

00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:31,299
answer possible the results showed

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:33,220
scientific development is now as popular

00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,569
as web development half of the

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,249
respondents work on data science

00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,949
projects and half on web development

00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:40,839
projects responses differ depending on

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:44,470
whether the respondent uses Python as

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,939
their main or secondary language 54% of

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,609
those who use piden as their main

00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:50,319
language are involved in web development

00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:52,869
comparing to only 33 or those who say

00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:54,850
python is their secondary language the

00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:57,399
difference is less significant for data

00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,910
analysis analysis machine learning and

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,429
other types of development as you may

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,129
have expected Python developers wear

00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:08,859
multiple hats the roles they combine

00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:11,470
most often can be seen on the slide as

00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:14,049
you can see top intersections are web

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,970
development data analysis and machine

00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:18,369
learning web development and data

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,929
analysis the intersection of data

00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:22,389
analysis in machine learning is somewhat

00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:24,610
expected however intersection between

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:26,350
web development and data analysis and

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,790
web development and machine learning are

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,829
definitely something noteworthy when

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,009
asked about the primary type of Python

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:38,259
development 26 of Python developers

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:41,439
identified as web developers outpacing

00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:44,319
data analysis reported by only 18% by a

00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:47,529
wide margin however if we combine those

00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:49,809
18 percent who reported as data analysts

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,089
with the 9 percent of people reported as

00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:55,360
machine learning specialists we learned

00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:58,720
that 27 percent are primarily doing data

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,399
science that means there are as many web

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,999
developers as there data scientists

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,529
using Python interestingly enough when

00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:08,919
she brings the despite on developers

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:12,249
survey in 2016 38 percent of respondents

00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:14,799
identified as web developers and only 21

00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,329
percent as scientific developers that

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,679
could be an evidence of rapid growth of

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:22,029
data science among Python developers

00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,649
the most intriguing question though in

00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,989
the Python developer survey concerned

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:28,420
the ratio of web developers and data

00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:30,249
scientist in the Python world we asked

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,410
respondents to estimate the ratio

00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:35,410
between web developers in that ascites

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,799
using Python respondents could answer

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,350
based on their beliefs experience and

00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,509
general gut feeling because we

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,910
explicitly asked about primary types of

00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,589
development in the previous question we

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,480
could compare the community perception

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,459
against the reality and what do you know

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,170
based on the data we've got from the

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,959
question about main type of development

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,089
where we had 26% reporting as web

00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,769
developers and 27 percent reporting

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,679
scientific development is their primary

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:06,160
activity the true ratio is one to one

00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:08,739
only one in nine respondents guessed

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,839
this correctly more than half of Python

00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:13,209
users think that web development is more

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,459
common before we move to the next

00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:18,639
section let's do a quick poll please

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:22,329
raise your hand if you do primarily web

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,850
development all right quite a lot of

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,850
people and now please raise your hand if

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:35,470
you do primarily data science any type

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:37,419
of data science machine learning so the

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:45,209
last round please raise your hand if you

00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:48,850
do both types of development that's cool

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:51,999
okay now let's talk about Python 2 and

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:55,119
python 3 and here we have another poll

00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:59,649
please raise your hand if you primarily

00:14:55,119 --> 00:15:01,869
use Python 2 it's okay to use Python 2

00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,699
actually there are a lot of people who

00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:06,939
are you still using Python 2 for many

00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:10,439
valid reasons okay good now please raise

00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:14,829
your hand if you primarily use Python 3

00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:17,769
wow wow that's great

00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,470
so when we asked which version of Python

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,629
do you use the most in our survey we

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,879
drove to an amazing finding so what do

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:29,009
you know python 3 is a strong leader at

00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,009
75% and fight them too

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,880
how cool is that and five and two is

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:38,610
used only by 25% Python 3 is growing

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,850
rapidly in the 2016 survey conducted by

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,990
JetBrains we had 60% reporting as using

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:48,300
Python to you and only 40% for Python 3

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,310
python to use is declining as it's not

00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,800
actively developed it doesn't get any

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,010
new features and it will be no longer

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,440
supported after 2020 it's not about that

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,930
70% of web developers are using Python 3

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,340
compared to 77 percent of data analyst

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,650
and 83 percent of machine learning

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,450
specialists this may be because many web

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,570
developers still have to maintain legacy

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:12,900
code while transitioning to Python 3 and

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:16,110
a lot of data science specialists join

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,290
the community just recently so they went

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,460
to Python 3 straight for work here you

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,840
can see the history of Python for

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,550
adoption based on the results of the

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,320
publicly available surveys for previous

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,330
years as you can see patent-free is

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,970
growing in popularity very fast and we

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,200
expect it's going to grow even faster

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,060
approaching the date when python 2 is no

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,350
longer supported we're really looking

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,330
forward to seeing the results of the

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,460
next iteration of the Python developer

00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,080
survey so what about frameworks

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,660
technologies and libraries used together

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,550
with Python with the survey we identify

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,590
the Django is the most popular framework

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,600
it's used by 41% of Latin developers

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,760
scientific packages combined such as

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,360
numpy pandas and metal clip are in close

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,710
second at 39% curiously 29% of web

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,050
developers are using scientific

00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,300
libraries this confirms a strong overlap

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,190
between the two roles when asked about

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,830
technologies used in addition to biotin

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,600
Jupiter notebook ranked highest at 31%

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,500
which makes sense given the large number

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,200
of developers involved in data science

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,959
dr. trails by only 2% at 29 breaking

00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,370
this down by rolls docker is used by 47%

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,050
of those

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,870
mostly involved in web development and

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,050
all about 23% of data scientists

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:27,690
similarly cloud platforms such as Amazon

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,140
with Amazon Google App Engine Heroku and

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,360
others

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,240
I used twice as often by web developers

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,190
than by data scientists comparing 2016

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,770
server results with 2007 Seventeen's

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,690
Jenga and flask the two most popular web

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,919
development frameworks have lost their

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,809
share on the other hand

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,010
the scientific libraries and

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:49,659
technologies have grown when asked which

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,320
cloud platforms they use cloud using

00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,940
respondents ranked AWS first at 67%

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,429
google appengine Heroku and digitalocean

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,710
I use far less often we were limited on

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,350
the number of cloud platforms which we

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:05,460
could list as potential answers so other

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,529
category collected 13% of responses

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,760
those responses include Li not Python

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:12,130
anywhere OpenShift

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,750
and OpenStack so keep them in mind they

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,389
are quite popular among Python

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,799
developers when we asked about use of

00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:19,330
development practices tools and

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,919
technology and features in Python

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,169
development the top spots were occupied

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,019
by code other completion refactoring

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,269
writing unit tests and using virtual

00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:30,190
environments for Python projects on the

00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:32,139
other hand no SQL databases Python

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,409
profilers and code coverage tools were

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:36,850
among most recent rarely used this

00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,760
results are very similar to the data

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,769
we've got in 2016 to identify the most

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,019
popular editors in IDs we asked two

00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,399
questions what editors IDs have you

00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,200
considered for use in your Python

00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:49,240
development with multiple answers

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,220
allowed and a single answer question

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,350
what is the main editor you use for your

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,120
current Python development base in more

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,519
than 8,000 replies to this question

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,409
Python is the most popular tool followed

00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:03,820
by sublime idle beam Hatem envious code

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,769
it's important to note that we took a

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,690
number of steps to eliminate bias and

00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,179
ensure the survey wasn't slanted in

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,500
favor of any specific tool as even

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,840
mentioned in the beginning of our talk

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,000
JetBrains didn't promote the survey on

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,580
any of its or any of its partners

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,679
channels the majority of responses came

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,299
through the python.org website and the

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:31,059
announcements on twitter by the Python

00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:32,799
severe foundation our goal is to improve

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,870
the survey so it can become a useful

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,019
tool for our community and a strong

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,519
indicator for pythons future for those

00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,700
of you that may have not seen the full

00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,399
results here's a link up there Spitzer

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,130
and we have started to collect feedback

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:50,370
for improvements and some notes include

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,380
improving our outreach with the survey

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,680
randomizing more questions I mean sorry

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,900
randomizing more answers to questions

00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,450
and adding a question on testing

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,300
frameworks and even trying to publish

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,240
the results sooner than we did last time

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:09,270
we plan to launch the next survey in

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,250
October of this year if anyone in the

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,710
audience or even watching at home later

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,470
on would like to collaborate or partner

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,310
with us in the future please contact us

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,910
at this email

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,620
it's surveys at python.org similarly if

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,150
you have feedback or ideas on how to

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,040
make the survey better in the future

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,530
don't hesitate to reach out via that

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,300
email as well in order to make something

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,860
useful for our community we have to get

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,300
as much feedback for the community from

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,040
the community as possible Dimitri and

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,710
his colleague will be presenting at the

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,300
poster session here at PyCon tomorrow in

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,910
Hall B & C which is happening at the

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,530
same time as the job fair so you are

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,100
welcome to stop by to chat more about

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:53,190
the survey or ask questions and before

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,730
we go to questions I'd like to point out

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,920
that the Python Software Foundation the

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,890
PSF which is the nonprofit behind Python

00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:05,640
is currently one of the charities for

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:08,970
the Humble Bundle dev bundle humble dev

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,040
bundle so there's a link up there sorry

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,540
we use the long one but if you would

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,630
like to purchase any of those products

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,450
or share the link with anyone part of

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:21,860
the proceeds go to the PSF so now we'll

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,860
open up the floor to any questions

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,450
hi thanks for sharing all this data with

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,070
us I'm really excited to see the the

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,330
survey and the survey results and how

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:45,030
we'll like follow trends over the years

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:47,490
while the first survey was unbiased

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,590
it was brought to us by JetBrains are

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:55,230
there any concerns of that influencing

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:57,930
future survey results and trends well so

00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,160
we use it in comparisons with some of

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,640
the things that aren't really related to

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:05,130
tools that people use but we definitely

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,200
are not going to be using the JetBrains

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,700
survey in future trends when we look at

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,590
future results

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,120
this one we definitely tried to make it

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,280
as unbiased as possible and will

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,870
continue to do so and this will be the

00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,430
results in from this survey will be the

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,110
benchmark for the future ones instead of

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,870
the JetBrains one that was done in

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:27,420
previous years okay thank you yep hi my

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,000
apologies if I missed it it was in the

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,430
survey tracking which specific minor

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,370
version of Python 3 was used like 3 4 3

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:37,440
5 3 6 or is it plan for the future

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,650
because I know from from my perspective

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,240
I've seen a lot of as of 3 6 the the

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,100
usage from the people that I talked to

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,840
has gone up quite a bit so I was just

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,230
curious if it's there's a breakdown of

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,510
minor versions with these survey we

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,150
didn't ask for specific python versions

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,130
but it's definitely something which we

00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:00,570
need to consider for our next iteration

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:03,570
thanks for thank you I noticed there's a

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:10,170
link there on the page to the raw data

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:14,250
that was used to generate oh it's great

00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:16,590
ok so that's it's awesome the raw data

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,600
is there is there anything out there

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:22,110
like I'm sure there is some tooling used

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,480
to generate the summary of the data is

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,400
there anything out there like a jupiter

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,520
notebook or something people can use to

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,130
kind of get started in inspecting the

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,340
raw data themselves that is a great idea

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:39,360
I don't think one exists we did have a

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:41,790
Python Easter on Twitter do several own

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,560
renditions of the data results but I

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,000
don't think there is a Jupiter notebook

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,430
but I think that is a super idea that we

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,400
should def

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,350
do as soon as we wrap up icon awesome

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,580
thanks thanks Derek by the way there is

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:57,100
something I forgot to tell that with

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,950
this survey we shared the raw data to

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,630
the public right so we welcome all of

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,790
you and actually encourage all of you to

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,640
look into the raw data to drive to your

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,500
own findings and conclusions right so if

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,910
you go to that survey link up there at

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,230
the bottom of the survey there's a link

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:15,990
where you can download the raw data and

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:22,230
do your own analysis on the data there

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:26,380
hi hey I'm impressed about the how the

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:29,650
Brazilian job positions grow in this

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,770
survey I would like to know if you if

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:36,100
you asked about if these positions are

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:39,340
remote for remote jobs or in place Jo

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,300
because that's something I really care

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:46,720
about because I'm from Central America

00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:53,370
Nicaragua we mostly applied to positions

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:57,070
remotely so our survey did not ask about

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,920
remote style work but I do think that

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,170
jobs dot Python org has a way that you

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,280
can filter for remote work if you're

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,360
interested in checking that out but

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,220
that's definitely something to note for

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:12,370
the future yes because I would like to

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:13,000
know how many of these depositions thank

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,950
you thank you

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,130
it's also very important to know that we

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:21,040
have issue tracker on did have github

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,770
for this survey so you can reach it by

00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,140
following the link on the slide go down

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:30,730
to the page right and see see the link

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,440
to the github yep cool looks like that's

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,900
all the questions we've got so please

00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,780
say thank you to uh for a great talk

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:42,309
thank you thank you
