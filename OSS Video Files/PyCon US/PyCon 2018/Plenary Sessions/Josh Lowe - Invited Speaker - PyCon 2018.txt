we start I'd just like to say thank you

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:12,530
to my dad for supporting me with this

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:15,839
project and because everything so um

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,350
let's get started so um I started

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,020
programming about I think it was five

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,650
years ago so when the Raspberry Pi kind

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:29,570
of started out and I fell into it a

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,679
really weird way so my mum knew a a

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,110
person who started the raspberry jam

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,710
movement in that actually started in

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,399
Preston where I live so I kind of got

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,739
into it and just by chance really and

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,399
I'll explain what my current project is

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,940
so um I developed some software called

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,239
AG box and to put it simply it is a

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,090
drag-and-drop version of Python 3 so um

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,940
when I started learning Python just over

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,030
two years ago I found it quite hard to

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,750
get used to the syntax with being a

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,840
student

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,390
I see firsthand the people in class

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,659
trouble learning text based programming

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,110
languages and I kind of developed a way

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,650
to make this easier so I took scratch is

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,890
an inspiration and I created dragon rock

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,430
python so a shoe box is kind of my

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,979
solution to this it's an easy way to

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,130
learn the Python C syntax so I'll

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,310
explain how it does with a demo in a

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,890
minute so it has the scratch like

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,140
interface but instead of having just

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,890
random text on the scratch box

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,899
it actually has Python code and it's an

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,310
educational tool to help younger

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,590
children make the transition from

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,430
scratch spice and so the problem that

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,790
we've got in the UK at the minute is

00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:00,840
scratch and python is quite a low age in

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,640
the education system so children are

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,560
finding it hard to learn pison so

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,979
they're going straight from scratch and

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,229
having no knowledge of how to type

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,730
programs so this scanner to make that

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,700
transition easier

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,750
it's also a platform for educators and

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,900
teachers and so resources are provided

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,920
for free - you can just pick up a

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,470
resource and your lesson is underway so

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,330
why did I create a box so we'll start

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:36,030
with a few statistics so in the UK a new

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,620
computing curriculum was introduced in

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,819
2014 so the government saw that

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,510
computing is this up-and-coming thing

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:48,000
the jobs are needed in software

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,670
engineering so they introduced a new

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,420
curriculum but the problem where's this

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:58,319
new curriculum was 74% of teachers had

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,590
inadequate training so the teachers

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,660
couldn't really teach it because there

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,819
was no resources there was no training

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,890
given to the teachers so they were kind

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,190
of at a loss of what to do but this is

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,799
improved over the four years that the

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,049
new curriculum has been introduced so

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,019
we've seen PI Academy which I'm sure

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,450
many of you have attended PI Academy in

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,239
the US and so there's all sorts of

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,359
different training programs in the UK

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:32,609
and the u.s. now to help this easy make

00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:35,730
it easier so what does AG box do so this

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:38,130
is kind of a typical scratch program on

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,310
the left see such a variable and then

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:44,180
print the variable and this is pison on

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,380
the right so you can see that it's

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,450
Scratchy's kind of drag-and-drop it's

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,250
got the visual blocks but then when you

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,180
go into Pais and it's straight away you

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,870
have to type it out and for high school

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,579
kids so about age 11 this can be quite

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,760
daunting if you've never done it before

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:06,989
so there's no in-between solution to

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,889
bridge the gap so this is Asia blocks so

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:13,290
you kind of got the same visual idea

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,790
where you drag and drop the box but

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,289
you're actually learning Python at the

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,750
same time because you got the Python

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:23,030
code whilst you drag and drop in the box

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:26,550
so it's kind of that in-between solution

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,430
so how does it help people so as I have

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,740
already mentioned you have the pison

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,910
code on the blocks so you can see what

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,729
you're doing in pison but you're doing

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,940
it in an easy way it gives you the

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,530
option to download the Python file so

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,139
once you dragged and drop your blocks

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,380
and build up your Python program you can

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:53,639
then export it and edit it as a normal

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,860
Python program you've got a pison view

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,530
so you just click a button and you

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,780
automatically get a text editor in which

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:05,250
you can edit the code and look what it

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:08,310
would be if you were typing it so what

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,750
platforms does a box work with so I'm

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,229
sure you've all heard that the raspberry

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:17,340
pi and you may use in school so the

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:19,530
raspberry pi is a $35 computer so it's

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:24,030
quite small but it can do all the things

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:26,010
that a normal computer would do you've

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,039
also got this device called the micro

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:33,539
bit so this was given to one million

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:37,889
children in the UK and back in 2015 so

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:41,849
that's a small I think it's $10 computer

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,570
and it has lots of features which I'll

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:49,530
show you in a minute so let's start with

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,270
the Raspberry Pi version of reg box so

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,020
I've already explained what oversleep is

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,630
so it was used to kind of help teachers

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,760
with the new computing curriculum so it

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,479
was an easy way to introduce physical

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,780
computing and coding without having the

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,400
barrier to entry of cost so this is a

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,270
Raspberry Pi edition this is where it

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,020
all started

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:16,590
so the Raspberry Pi Edition includes all

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,050
your basic Python commands so you've got

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,050
wild tree print statements but you've

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,950
also got Minecraft so the recipe pie has

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:29,250
a really cool minecraft Edition which

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,599
you can actually program with pison so

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,190
that's in a tree box

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,830
you got GPIO 0 which was made by

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,650
not from Raspberry Pi and that is an

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:44,150
easy way to control LEDs with physical

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:47,620
computing sonic PI which is making music

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:51,950
with code that was created by Siloam and

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,470
that's being used in over I think it's a

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,240
million people that are using that now

00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,070
you've got all sorts of different

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,460
add-ons like the sense hats which you're

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,130
in space so that's just a quick overview

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,870
of all the different things that you can

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,550
do so if we have a quick demo of this so

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,190
you can see that it's very scratch like

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,830
you've got your toolbar at the left and

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,910
you just drag and drop the blocks of

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,590
pison into the workspace so you still

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,680
got the same pace and commands but

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:28,010
you're used to how scratch works so it's

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:32,660
quite familiar and then you just type in

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,820
the boxes and then if you click the Run

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:42,550
button it'll run it as if it's a normal

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:50,210
Python script skip one

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:54,320
so the Oh someone - what is it playing

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:56,030
it there we go so this is a Adam board

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,700
called the blink so the really cool

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:02,270
thing about the Raspberry Pi is it has

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:05,030
these GPIO pins and companies like pin

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,690
Roni and Adafruit make Adam boards that

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:12,500
can go onto the GPIO pins and that

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:15,380
provides a fun way to get into coding so

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,240
as you can see this is the PI symbol you

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,730
see just click the button and you get

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,790
the text editor and then you run it and

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,520
the lights will come on in the corner so

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,970
the next demo is minecraft this is quite

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,030
popular one because all kids love

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:35,060
minecraft and so you're dragging and

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,740
dropping the blocks before but you can

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,370
see that you're building up an actual

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,010
Python program so this will just print

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,700
something in the corner now because of

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,130
the resolution of the pie and

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,520
you can't really see it but this should

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,240
be like a bar that comes up it does say

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,420
I'm not lying

00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,390
um so let's go into the mic bit so um

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:06,040
the microfiche as I said it was given to

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:10,030
every 11 and 12 year old in the oh it's

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,270
meant to say 2015 but so a microp it has

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:17,710
all sorts of different features so it

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:21,190
can be programmed inmate code pison and

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:25,750
all those programming languages and it

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,070
has a 5 by 5 LEDs way so the first thing

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,950
that you do with a microp it is get it

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,670
to scroll your name because that's a fun

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,190
thing to do

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:38,560
so the microfiche room was introduced

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:41,920
back in was it November I think and it

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:46,600
came up as an idea at PyCon UK at the

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:50,290
education summit so I spent 3 months

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,430
developing this and it finally became a

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:57,430
thing so it still got the same interface

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,530
but instead this runs on any computer

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,510
instead of just the Raspberry Pi so as

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,230
long as you have a mic but you can just

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:10,540
go to mic bit dodgy box 2 org and you

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:13,510
should be able to have a go with it so

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,430
you can still switch to pison view but

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,860
the way the microfiche is you actually

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:23,550
download a file and upload it to the

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:28,510
microphone as if it was a flash drive so

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:30,240
turn the lights off so you can see it so

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,040
you can kind of make out that it's

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:39,490
scrolling hello world in the corner

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,920
there so um where is AG box currently so

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:48,750
um I started AG box

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:51,490
I think it was about two years ago so I

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,890
started out with scratch and did a few

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,470
scratch projects and then someone said

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,130
oh why don't you learn Python and I was

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,880
like I don't want to learn Python

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,250
and and I'm kind of glad I did now and

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,170
because it's got me further than I ever

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:12,580
thought it would do and pison in the UK

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,890
is only been taught to year 9 which is

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:19,880
13 and 14 year olds so it's still quite

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:23,660
an old age to be learning it so hbox is

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,840
kind of making it easier for younger

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,790
kids to learn it and because pison

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,800
should be something that should be

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,170
learned much earlier because the earlier

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,300
you start the better you become with it

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:41,030
so it's now got 9,000 active users and

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:44,210
and that goes across 72 countries so

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:47,840
it's expanding each month and there's

00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:52,220
always new things coming and so

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,400
education this is a fun thing it's being

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,520
used in schools around the world so

00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:03,740
whether that be teach your CPD training

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:07,460
in the classroom or at events like PyCon

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,280
and stuff so there's been lots of

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,320
feedback from teachers saying that it's

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,550
helped their children kind of learn

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:20,390
pison and it's really good to see that

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,160
it's making an impact on so many schools

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,890
because that was kind of the goal from

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,160
the start and it had a slow start but

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:32,660
then as more more people found out about

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,540
it it's kind of expanded and we have a

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,780
quick video from a former teacher and a

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:43,060
stem ambassador explaining what a chi

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,060
box is and how she uses it Oh

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,790
yeah

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:08,689
hello Josh asked me to talk about edge

00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,089
blocks to you and explain my experience

00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:14,929
of using it with Kirk clubs and without

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,179
reach and what I do as part of working

00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:19,910
with Peroni is I go into schools and I

00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:22,100
try and get children into learning stem

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,220
learning tech and learning how to code

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,170
and one of the main problems I find as a

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,649
former special educational needs teacher

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:34,639
is that children don't necessarily grasp

00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:37,819
the syntax of coding and although

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,069
scratch is useful and some of them have

00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:41,629
picked it up a lot of the concepts are

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,389
very abstract whereas it with edge

00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,529
blocks they're very very clear as to

00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:48,679
what they mean

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:51,319
I find that edgy blocks is great for

00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,149
sonic PI it's great for Minecraft which

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:57,290
obviously draws children in because all

00:13:53,149 --> 00:14:00,589
children of Minecraft it takes out the

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,209
pain of GPIO zero which is a great way

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,689
of controlling things using your

00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:09,319
Raspberry Pi but with edge blocks it's

00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:11,149
completely painless also I work from

00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:13,399
Pomerania so I'm kind of biased because

00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:16,009
there are so many libraries for pomona

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,399
add-ons also within edge blocks which is

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:21,259
great it's you not just left to fend for

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,379
yourself either there's a whole learning

00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:27,019
portal so josh has actually created

00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,850
tutorials which guide you through all

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:31,610
these new concepts and all these new

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:35,179
things I described it as a work of

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:37,549
chuffing genius and I'm not joking Josh

00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:40,100
knows he's tested it in the field I've

00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:43,670
seen him deliver excellent coding

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:48,049
workshops to his peers and to to people

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,839
way more experienced than him and he

00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:54,169
knows what it's like to be frustrated to

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,110
have to wait for all your typing to come

00:14:54,169 --> 00:15:00,519
true as it were and by making edge

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,739
blocks he's made it fundamentally clear

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:07,600
fundamentally easy and anybody can pick

00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:07,600
it up so I would recommend it to anybody

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:18,339
right so along with Ag box as a program

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,430
I've also devout some resources and

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:25,720
lesson plans and so the lesson plans are

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:29,829
made in conjunction with some trainee

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,259
teachers in the UK and so there are lots

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:34,360
of free resources so edge' blocks is

00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:39,370
free itself there's nothing that's paid

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,870
for so ever since free cheese program so

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,930
that kind of lowers the barrier to entry

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,449
if you want to use it so um you can just

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,949
go to the learning portal and get a

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:51,690
resource sheet and it'll guide you

00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:55,690
through all these steps to get started

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,880
so lesson plans and there are more

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:00,250
coming with the lesson plans and I just

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,699
need to finish work on some of them and

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,610
but there are a few up there already so

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:08,470
it has all the things that you need to

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,380
do a lesson so you've got the actual

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:16,779
lesson plan itself and you have the

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,510
PowerPoint to go alongside it as well as

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:20,260
the worksheets so it comes as a full

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,130
package

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,899
so you've got your lesson objectives and

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,990
explanations in there so that's all

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:34,240
there so the next step is to develop

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:37,449
some hardware for Ag box so I think in

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,339
the unconference bit I'm going to ask

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,800
some teachers what they think of new

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,319
ideas for boards to add so this is the

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,870
first one so it's a simple pelican

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:49,660
crossing so you just put that on your

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,269
recipe pie and you have access to a

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,980
buzzer which if you have searched DS and

00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:56,980
a clustering it can get quite loud and

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,930
then if you've got a teacher that you

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,380
don't like next door you can really

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:05,530
annoy them so you've got your traffic

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,829
lights red and green man and a button to

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:13,150
go with that so it comes as a kit or pre

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,850
soldered so as well as learning coding

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,459
you can also do a bit of

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:20,209
Tronics as well and so it's just a

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,160
starter board to get started with that

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,949
but some ideas would be greatly

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:33,150
appreciated for where to go with the

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:35,370
next one the next step for edge blocks

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:40,320
is to get circuit python working with it

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:44,400
so this is the GEMA and 0 and it's a

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,669
small ten dollar microcontroller and it

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,090
can run Python so you've got this is an

00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:53,730
example was the onboard dot star and but

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:58,740
I've also got ping control working so he

00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:00,630
can hook up motors with PWM and all that

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,039
sort of stuff so if you'd like to see a

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,250
demo of that I'd be happy to show you

00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:10,980
future plans so we have the lesson plans

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:14,210
which I mentioned that's kind of the

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,370
next step AG box for circuit pison and

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,580
the thing that's not on there is I also

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,980
want to in the future merge the PI

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,740
version the Mac bit version and the

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,280
circuit python version all together and

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,559
include some basic Python stuff and

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,020
there so kind of getting the basics of

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,289
pison and so it's something like that

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:41,190
it'd be quite good and also the mind

00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:43,350
spark range of educational boards for

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,549
the Raspberry Pi and the mic bit instead

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:51,240
of flat and so the good thing about edgy

00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:55,200
box is it's all open source so if any

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:58,020
developers out there I want to help with

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,809
code or even teachers who want to submit

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,960
an issue or a feature request I'm always

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:05,850
happy to add stuff in and so it's all

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,010
open source on github so if you just go

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:12,320
to that link you can see the code there

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:14,750
and with edgy what's been a free project

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,280
it's always going to be free but

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,350
unfortunately these things aren't free

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,750
to run when you have to buy boards to

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,350
test it out and stuff so there is a

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,350
patreon page

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:29,500
if you just want to put a dollar in

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,690
something to support Asia box its

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,590
greatly appreciated because it allows

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,890
the project to move on further and also

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:42,100
helps me out with testing so that you

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,330
get a better user experience if you'd

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,950
like to find out more

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,290
there's a website at the top edge of

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,360
watts - org or you can find me on

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,490
Twitter or send me an email

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,500
I'll be happy to reply with any

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,500
questions thank you

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,350
so does anyone have any questions that

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,350
you'd like me to answer now

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:22,110
yes so a really cool feature about edge

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,650
boxes if you run the PI version and go

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:28,140
to the IP address on your iPad or phone

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,870
you can actually program your resume

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,580
from that and a mobile version would be

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,770
something that I want to look at with

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,299
like basic pious and commands so that

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,549
could be something that could come in

00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:42,409
the future I have actually started work

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:45,270
on a basic pison thing that would run on

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:49,100
anything with a web browser so that is

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,100
something that would come in the future

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,230
so edgy box is mainly written in

00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,650
JavaScript and it uses the Google

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,169
Berkeley API which basically you

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,799
programmed the blocks and then that will

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:10,830
generate some code to Center a pice and

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,049
server which will then run it as if you

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,610
typed it so yeah so it's mainly

00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,990
JavaScript and but there's Python and

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:21,000
typescript and stuff like that in there

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:25,380
so it's really a range of different

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,250
languages to make it it is most of it is

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:33,630
a massive hack to get it to work but it

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:40,159
does the job so maybe one day I'll tidy

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:40,159
up the code but for now it works so yes

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:50,890
and so in workshops I've ran energy box

00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:54,029
workshop with some eight-year-olds who

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:57,429
had never touched programming before and

00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,649
they didn't really make any hours and so

00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:01,149
yeah you don't really have to start with

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:02,980
scratch you can go straight onto this

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:05,890
because it is basically the same

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,299
interface but you can start with scratch

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,730
and their energy box in their place and

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:15,840
but yeah you don't need to if you don't

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:24,330
want to do yeah okay thank you

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:24,330
