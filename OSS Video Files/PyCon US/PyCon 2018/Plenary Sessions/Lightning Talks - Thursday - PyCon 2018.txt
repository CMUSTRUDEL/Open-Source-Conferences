hi there my name is Ariel Ortiz I come

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,929
from Mexico from tecnolÃ³gico de

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,330
Monterrey this is the first time I come

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,650
to the education summit so it's really

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,289
awesome being here I just want to talk

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,470
about a little bit my experience using

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,470
Python in competitive programming

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:34,290
competitive programming refers to the

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:37,440
well basically this kind of a sport in

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,210
which students are able to program to

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,640
solve problems specifically my

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,590
experience has been here in the IC PC

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,590
for IC M and I see PC me in stands for

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,180
inter-college at programming contests

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,210
this is a photograph of me and my

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,640
students this is the World Finals in in

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,550
Dovan in the Netherlands in 1999 it's

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,410
almost 20 years ago so it seems to me

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,170
yeah I was a little bit younger at that

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:09,659
time okay just in case you're not sure

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,600
that this is um this is me here okay so

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,290
what is IC PC what are the rules for

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,689
this programming competition basically

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,330
you have teams of students three

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,290
students per team there is only one

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,119
computer our students have five hours in

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,000
order to solve from a to fifteen

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,680
problems as many as they can in my

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,659
experience sometimes students are unable

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,390
to solve not even one but usually they

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,090
solve one to at least most most a time

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,030
well really depends on the level of the

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,040
competition but usually there are at

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,009
least one or two problems that are

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,240
typically fairly easy so most most teams

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,860
actually get to solve them

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,299
so during many years the only

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,790
programming languages that you could use

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:02,939
we're seeing C++ and Java fortunately

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,049
since of the World Finals last year in

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,429
2017 we were able to allow our students

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,340
to also use Python and that was very

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,960
very good news because before that we

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,910
only were able to use these actually

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,440
years ago when we started they allowed

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,000
to use Pascal but at some point they

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,460
actually took it away

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,050
but now Python is there and I just

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,650
checked the rules and they're allowing

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,300
to now use Copeland as well seems to

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,400
become a very popular language since

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,960
recently Google well more or less a year

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,180
ago Google announced that Android was

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,760
you were going to be able to program

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,810
android applications using complan okay

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,000
so the general program flow when you're

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,920
in these programming competitions is

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,340
very simple it looks just like a

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:57,220
standard UNIX filter you have a program

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,680
it reads all the input from the standard

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:05,260
input and you generate the output in the

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,970
standard output and in general this is

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,580
very easy but the problems are usually

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,900
not that simple in the sense of the

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,540
algorithms has to be fairly

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,810
sophisticated but in its general form

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,330
this is how they work sometimes a little

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,830
bit the difficulty stems on and the

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,650
students actually knowing how to read

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,130
from the standard input but in practice

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,740
the programs are actually tested through

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,390
redirection so even though we we say we

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,310
read from standard standard usually

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:39,670
we're using files that are redirected to

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:41,320
these input and output streams so um the

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,780
interesting part here in in what you

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,120
might actually find useful at least most

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,820
of you is that there are several online

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,980
judges that you can test your

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,320
programming skills with so even if you

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,760
don't plan to use it in in competitive

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,780
programming because I know that some

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,390
students actually get a little bit

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,280
stressed out when they work in this very

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:05,140
competitive environment but if you find

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,170
if you like the puzzles if you like

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,640
programming puzzles these online judges

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,880
are pretty cool because they allow you

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,070
to see a problem description and you can

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,500
take as long as you want to actually

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,650
solve these problems in its more general

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,970
form so just in case any of you are

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,640
interested these are the ones that I

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,430
found I've found in the past most useful

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,310
there is the sphere online judge this is

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,229
a Paul

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,169
sign it works pretty well there's this

00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:35,449
other side the Caribbean online judge

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,430
which is a Cuban site and there's this

00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,710
other side Omega up this one's pretty

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,900
cool because it's very easy to add your

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,229
own problems so you can actually use

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,430
this site if you want to do your own

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:48,979
programming competitions locally for

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,580
your own students if you find that

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:56,120
useful okay so one of the main

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,639
advantages that I see here is that using

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,680
these these sites and in general the

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,150
spirit of competitive programming is

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,830
that students that really like

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,460
challenges and they work well under

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:11,150
pressure that you pretty well do some

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,289
really awesome work but even if if as I

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,919
mentioned before if you don't really

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,870
want to have your students go under the

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,939
stress you can always use these judges

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,949
even for standard homeworks programming

00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,870
assignments or some really nice problems

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,419
you can use they're one of the main

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,330
disadvantages that I see this is that

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,939
these programming contests are really

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:36,199
much focused on on solving the problem

00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:39,199
fast and they don't give you any extra

00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,990
points if you do it in a neat way in in

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,180
a clear way using a documentation or

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,099
elegant algorithms or whatever usually

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,289
it's just a matter of if it works it's

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:52,580
fine if it doesn't work your program is

00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:53,569
going to be rejected so I think you have

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,509
to be careful with that because

00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:59,149
otherwise students might actually start

00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,460
trying to have this emphasis on doing

00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:04,099
things fast without doing them

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,930
necessarily well okay but I mean you you

00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,339
can take it as a way that they can

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,279
actually practice their their

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:13,069
problem-solving in algorithm design

00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:16,069
skills okay so thank you very much for

00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:18,439
listening to me this link you can find

00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,810
this presentation if you want to have a

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,480
closer look to the to the links okay and

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:29,929
thank you very much for having me

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,929
[Applause]

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,270
you

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,360
okay hello my name is Anne a and today

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,820
I'm gonna talk about how I became a

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,890
teaching assistant playing mad libs so

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,920
first off how many people know what mad

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:33,700
libs is here okay I thought like very

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,880
few people would know anyways so uh a

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,500
little bit about myself so I've been

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,330
just learning to code since fifth grade

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,700
and since now I'm finishing up sixth

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,480
grade so it's just been about year a

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,950
year so I use the pie kit curriculum for

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
this and I'll show you what it is so

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,190
this is the pikas curriculum it was

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,010
started by my mom about three years ago

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,610
when she began to get involved with the

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,050
like education summit and Python so I'm

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,220
just gonna scroll down you can see a

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:09,180
little bit about it

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,180
so yeah this is the pie kids curriculum

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:18,280
um so from the pike its curriculum we've

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,190
learned many things and by we meaning my

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,560
my I and my friends um so so far we have

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,150
coated a simple calculator played with

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,620
strings created a report card with

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,760
different I'll statements and made a

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,760
chess board with four loops

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,010
um so recently you think around fall I

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,020
got a challenge to create a fun activity

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,100
but I could contribute to the class and

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,290
which was a mad libs

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,730
I love playing mad lives with my brother

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,430
and I started thinking and creating my

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,930
lives with Python using basic concepts

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,660
of variables and statements that I've

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,760
learned so far here's what I created

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,500
before I go to the mad libs page I had a

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,910
lot of laughs with my friends when they

00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,360
ran this gave me got some very funny mad

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,770
libs

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,210
so let's try um so as you can see this

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,060
is my mad libs it was made on the

00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,010
Jupiter notebook um so I'm gonna need

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,990
the audience's health for this one and

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,640
I'm gonna call out like different part

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,010
of speeches and whoever raised their

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,990
hand or shout out like an adjective in

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,490
this case or whichever part of speech

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,320
comes up I'll just type it in and we'll

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,130
see what we get alright so saying if

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,130
someone give me an adjective

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:38,400
okay I'm just gonna write funny

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:42,020
can someone suggest a noun please can

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,020
someone please say a verb in past tense

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:54,000
can someone please type in an adverb can

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,480
someone please type in an I mean say an

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
adjective

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:12,570
can someone please say it out again

00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:15,620
someone please hand down again need

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,620
someone please say another adjective

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:33,990
okay I need a verb

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:35,760
I need another adverb no okay thank God

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:42,660
I got prepared um can someone please

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:45,780
tell me a past tense verb can someone

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:52,380
please say an adjective I've missed the

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:53,880
last one okay so the mad lives as

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,950
generated for those of you cannot see

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,260
I'll read it out to you today I went to

00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,339
the zoo I saw a funny Carol jumping up

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,030
and down in his tree

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,860
he ran okay he she ran quickly through a

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,810
large tunnel that led to its heavy dog I

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,460
got some peanuts and passing through the

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,490
case to a gigantic green Nikolaus

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,280
towering above my head seeing that

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,810
animal made me hungry I went to get a

00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,670
heavy scoop of ice-cream and filled my

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,100
stomach afterwards I had to slither

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,020
crazily to catch the bus when I got home

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,270
I swam my okay

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,330
I swam my mom about the slimy day at the

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,350
zoo so that was my mad lives and we're

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,350
gonna go back to the presentation

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,430
so unfortunately my math lives game made

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,890
it to the pike its curriculum and this

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,620
is where I became a TA around January

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,450
2018 I've been helping my friends and

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,089
other children from the Olive Children

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,410
Foundation in the Bay Area to create

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,200
their own mat lives and also learn

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,670
Python the fun part is that even on the

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,250
job I still continue to learn more

00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,730
Python by the way I also set up the

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:03,160
projector anaconda kids down my salary

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,220
was a $10 Starbucks gift card from the

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,860
Olive children so that's all for my

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:14,119
presentation thank you for listening

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,119
[Applause]

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,440
you

00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:57,660
alright I'll restart okay so I'm a bit

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,579
nervous about giving this talk which

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,500
that did not help with the first reason

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,240
is I thought of it an hour ago and lots

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,790
of people have clearly given much better

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,290
thought-out talks than this will be and

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,600
to is I don't know how it will be

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,939
received but I guess I'll find out so I

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,279
wanted to talk about adult education in

00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:18,720
Python and I noticed there a lot of

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,160
smart people here who are passionate

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,189
about education and I noticed a lot of

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,290
it is centered on K through 12 and

00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:27,329
there's fundamentally a different set of

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,069
challenges in adult education and I

00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,300
think if I can convince one person that

00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,250
thinking about those challenges is

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,560
useful then I'll fulfill my selfish

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,600
motivation of having better online adult

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,939
education for myself

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,949
so the primary difference with adult

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:42,600
education as I see it is there's a big

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:44,519
subset of people that are actually

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,139
trying to escape a box that's been put

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,600
around them and that box can be a

00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,699
dead-end job that box can be not having

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,889
freedom that box can be not being able

00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:56,250
to kind of hit your idealized version of

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,959
yourself and in order to kind of commit

00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,730
to learning as an adult for 10 to 20

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,480
hours a week when you might have kids

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,490
when you might have other

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,380
responsibilities it takes a huge

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,139
commitment right so you need to really

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,500
see the value in in adult education very

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,540
very quickly so for me personally my box

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,579
was being stuck working in factories and

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,740
other kind of bureaucratic jobs that I

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,829
really did not like and Python in a very

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,439
real sense was freedom right so I and a

00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:23,910
lot of people I've taught over the years

00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:26,220
have kind of this idealized version of

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,810
themselves and they see programming is

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,519
getting them to that idealized version

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,350
of themselves but they don't always

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,930
understand how it will get it will get

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,339
them there and learning adult learning

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,259
is really a way to make that process

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,240
more efficient right if you lock a smart

00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,559
person in a room they can theoretically

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,850
figure out programming on their own

00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,050
right if you lock them in with some

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,819
books they can figure out a little bit

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,110
better if you give them online education

00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,680
or a boot camp maybe they can figure out

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,809
even better so it's really about not

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,639
wasting time and being able to see clear

00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,990
concrete progress towards your goals and

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,959
being more efficient with what you're

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,670
learning the unfortunate part and I

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,649
think the two big challenges that remain

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,930
to be solved are what causes people to

00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,850
drop off right so people stop

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,320
when they no longer see how they can get

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,270
to that idealized vision of themselves

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,760
right how they can break out of this box

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,040
how they can avoid that dead-end job

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,720
their stocky a net cetera and one thing

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,220
that comes that the causes that is when

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,080
they no longer see the value of the

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,820
resource they're using and no longer

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,720
helps them make their progress towards

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,930
their idealized self the other way that

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,670
this happens is some people programming

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,779
is a completely new mental model right

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,220
it's a completely different way of

00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,410
thinking particularly if you're an adult

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,940
coming to it and that can be very very

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,620
hard to kind of get your head around and

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,630
particularly if you have the wrong

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,700
resource you can be convinced that you

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,709
can't learn it when in fact you can it's

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,810
you're just learning it the wrong way

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:47,490
the second big class of challenges is

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,700
around people who don't even kind of see

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,620
that idealized vision of themselves so

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,850
there's a lot of people out there who

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,290
have figured out that they have an

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,880
idealized vision of themselves and

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,230
learning Python and programming is the

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,240
way to get there but there's a lot more

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,800
people who have a fuzzy vision of their

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,510
idealized self and they don't really

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,640
understand the programming is the way to

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,520
get there in the first place right so

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,199
how do you reach people who would want

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,579
to learn programming but don't know that

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,380
they want to learn programming it's a

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,910
really interesting and big challenge I

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,300
personally don't have any answers to but

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,890
hopefully someone here will the other

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,040
one is people that believe that they

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,240
can't do it so as kids maybe they they

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,910
were told by a teacher that they

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,679
couldn't learn or they they ran into a

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,000
roadblock and never managed to cross it

00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,940
and now they're convinced they can never

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,450
program or learn math etc and that

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,400
causes a lot of people to also never try

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,020
unfortunately right so those are kind of

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,660
the two big classes of challenge how do

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,040
you reach people who aren't who have

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,720
kind of an idealized vision and a path

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,340
to get there but they don't believe that

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,960
their path is going to work and then

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,000
people who don't even have the path and

00:17:48,960 --> 00:18:00,599
that's my talk

00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,599
[Applause]

00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,120
so I'll start out with economic

00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,559
development corporation if you aren't

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,509
familiar with that if you may have one

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,279
in your community it's a it's an entity

00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:25,649
that's usually created at the state

00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,529
level and also local levels to promote

00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:30,720
economic the economy of the local place

00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:33,029
so recruit businesses bring in retail

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,500
bringing new restaurants all that kind

00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,320
of stuff and the motivation for that is

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,789
sales revenue get more tax the tax goes

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,480
of the city and then some of that

00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,220
funding is used so my name is Joel Garza

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,529
and well I don't claim to be a Python

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,809
developer I am a staunch Python advocate

00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:50,429
my claim to fame among those who have

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,230
been regularly attending PyCon is I

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,549
purchased a hundred raffle tickets for

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,149
the pilot is auction about three years

00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:59,789
ago and I won over half the prizes which

00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:01,350
kind of like to change the dynamic and

00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,610
the one Panda my supporter and the other

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,409
hand I'm like hoarding all the prizes

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:08,429
which I ended up giving up and most of

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:10,230
them away I did volunteer early on met

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,759
the wonderful Python staff saw Jesse

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,429
Nola's keynote and fell in love with the

00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,230
community and I've tried to be a part of

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:17,580
it as much as I can or since life's been

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,759
a little bit of a winding path since

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,230
2012 and so I have not achieved a role

00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,850
as a Python developer I continue to

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,429
promote Python and Python based tools

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,320
whenever it fits the occasion so back to

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,940
economic development I now serve as the

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,009
director of technology for the mission

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,480
Economic Development Corporation were in

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,820
Mission Texas which is in the South

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,850
Texas Rio Grande Valley we have a

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,559
population about 85,000 people and we

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,259
also have a five OC three called the

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,620
mission economic development council

00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:49,769
that we use for some of our programs so

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,080
our director had the vision to kind of

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:54,570
expand beyond the traditional EDC role

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,759
we promote STEM education both adult and

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,230
K through 12 in our community to build

00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,789
the skills that are needed for higher

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,409
paying jobs and with an emphasis on

00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:01,760
technology computational thinking and

00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,680
pro

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,810
and we do this through some homegrown

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,270
programs such as code the town web of

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,940
women and career readiness and

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,700
empowerment of women called khru we also

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,780
hire people we license curriculum we

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,610
form partnerships with other

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,590
organizations like CompTIA and code

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,540
interactive and we also support

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,100
legislation like House bill 728 where

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,870
computer science will now count as an

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,600
advanced math or science credit towards

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,450
graduation in high schools for Texas so

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,570
the idea there is if we can build up the

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:35,480
skills of the people one they'll have a

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,220
better trajectory for the jobs that they

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,890
could be eligible for and to get and

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,630
also hopefully that as the years

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,000
progressed that we will build enough of

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,800
that skill in the area to recruit

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,990
businesses because we have very few tech

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,560
businesses it's a heavy manufacturing

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,940
and service oriented area so we're

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,340
determined to continue to move forward

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,560
last year we converted an old Kmart into

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,050
our Center for education and economic

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,480
development as a place to have a corking

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,930
space offices and classrooms for all of

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,520
us to be held so what I'm wanting to do

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,140
having attended the education summit

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,220
before and seeing the wonderful thing we

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,390
had some great talks today about

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:18,590
community is to seek advice wisdom help

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,360
partners mentors just anything that if

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,860
anyone feels very strongly about one of

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,200
their projects that you'd like to see

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,690
implemented another area we have the

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,320
space we have our own funds we can apply

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,730
for grants we've just in the last year

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,890
we've received over five hundred

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,840
thousand dollars in grants for programs

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,240
for adult education and retraining and

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,340
so that's what I want and so I want to

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,990
offer to you is in your community if

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,810
you're looking for supporters I'm

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,940
amongst other you know businesses and

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:50,330
things that can sponsor you is see if

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,650
your your your local EDC is kind of in

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,330
the mode to be able to look at

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,040
supporting some other things because

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,200
they do have money to invest in the

00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,910
community they'll sponsor tables for the

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,590
hospital and things like that but see if

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,990
they can help support you in that way

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,750
and there's depending on your state

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,060
there's grants that when matched by EDC

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,000
money you can get matching funds to be

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,070
able to help support these programs

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,920
if you have any ideas you'd like to

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,350
speak with me look for me around the

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,880
conference I'll be here until Tuesday if

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,450
you have any questions about economic

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,460
development

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,050
I only know as much as I know from the

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,850
last year from within the state of Texas

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,350
but it's certainly something that you

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,140
should look to to try to leverage

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:34,789
whereas if you can thank you

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,789
[Applause]

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Hey or is there HDMI

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,710
you

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,250
you

00:24:52,030 --> 00:25:02,410
can you hear me oh now you can't so this

00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:02,410
is my first time to PyCon thank you

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,620
and I'm a new Python user so I'm

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,690
learning Python myself and loving it and

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,620
I'm excited to continue learning here at

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:17,630
the event my background is I'm a

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,960
co-founder and board member of a

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,210
makerspace nonprofit and so our whole

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,420
mission is to increase STEM education

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:32,090
and so I teach a lot of our classes like

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:35,750
on 3d printing laser cutting woodworking

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,120
welding and yet we're starting to get

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,660
more into like robotics and stuff and so

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,610
learning code is for me something I want

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,220
to do so that I can make things move

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,900
make things move and use sensors and

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:53,450
actuators and more of the physical

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:55,309
things but in learning Python I was told

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,559
as a young person that I had a reading

00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:59,090
disability and so one of the most

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,559
frustrating things about learning Python

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,500
is you'll go out and you'll get a book

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,300
and it's like this thick and if you're

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,160
supposed to just read page after page

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,070
it's hard enough if you have a reading

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,690
disability just to read English and then

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,350
you throw in all the syntax and the

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,510
jargon and it's like you're having to

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,250
basically climb this insurmountably high

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,679
mountain and so I can definitely relate

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,690
to the young man that was up here two

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,720
stalks ago about just the intimidation

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:30,290
factor and I think I've given up three

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,820
or four times and had to get back on the

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,770
trail and try to hike a little bit

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,900
further each time and then I give up and

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,820
then I get back and I just never feel

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,309
like I get much accomplishment because

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,770
that format just doesn't work for me I'm

00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:48,410
more of an experiential learner and so I

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,290
decided I think I need to design a new

00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:54,080
way to learn so that people like me can

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:57,350
learn the way I need to learn and so

00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,310
what I thought of was a card game I was

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:03,560
playing a lot of word cards against

00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,210
humanity' and those types of card games

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,020
apples to apples and so I was thinking

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,750
how would you teach

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,340
Python as a card game so there's no

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,910
computers involved you're completely

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,300
offline

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:16,100
and the focus would be reading code not

00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,140
writing code because I think a lot of

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,510
the time you try to get people writing

00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:23,420
code as quickly as possible and I feel

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,920
like reading code is more important

00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,040
because you want to read really good

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,050
code before you start writing your own

00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,400
we teach every kid in America and

00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,150
hopefully all around the world how to

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,860
read

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,230
we don't spec them all to be published

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,630
authors we don't expect them to be

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,730
Shakespeare but if they can read

00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,280
Shakespeare we expect them to have a

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,110
better life and I think everyone should

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,170
learn to read code not everyone

00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:51,560
necessarily needs to become a programmer

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:53,990
and so this card game hopefully if it

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,470
materializes will help teach more and

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,840
more people to read code and so the way

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:04,610
I went about it was I started looking at

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,620
all of the cheat sheets this one I found

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,710
to be helpful because it broke things

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:14,500
down different kind of bite size

00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:16,880
categories ku dict I don't know if I'm

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,610
pronouncing that correctly but on github

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,530
has this all of Python three and one

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,030
page and you can print this out as a

00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,030
poster which we have up in our

00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:28,670
makerspace now and it kind of breaks out

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,280
all of these fundamental components of

00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:36,460
the Python language into different kind

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:40,100
of a mind map I found this Python

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,280
introduction in a notebook and I went

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,050
through and it had really nice

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:50,420
categories of introducing the Python

00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:52,970
language the this is blurry sorry about

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,610
that but learn X&Y minutes is a nice

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,170
website I found and the Python tutorial

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:05,120
and there I felt like was very concise

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:08,000
and easy to follow but ultimately can

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,210
you recognize what a variable is can you

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,980
recognize what a function is because I

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,700
feel like recognition precedes

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,610
comprehension so until you can identify

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:22,029
what these objects are

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:25,299
and I read early on everything in Python

00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:27,640
is an object until you can identify what

00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:33,490
objects are functions and what objects

00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:36,279
are variables and methods and all of the

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,380
different terms then you're really not

00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,799
able to navigate through reading other

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:44,649
people's code very well so I started

00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:47,169
taking programs and cutting them into

00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:52,210
small segments little snippets of code

00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:54,519
and I pasted them onto cardstock which I

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,130
printed on a color printer which I had

00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,200
identified with different point values

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:03,580
based on the difficulty I felt like of

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,019
that segment of code and ironically I

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,820
realized halfway through I was cutting

00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:15,240
and pasting code physically which was

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:17,529
pretty fun I did not have a clipboard no

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,059
but I did this for seven complete

00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:24,610
programs until I had a full deck of

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:26,880
cards and these made up the code cards

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,350
and so that's one segment of the game

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,000
and each one is worth the specific

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:35,049
amount of points if you can correctly

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,909
answer the quiz on the code card the

00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,610
first player to complete an entire

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:40,630
program from start to finish

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,490
indicates the end of the game then

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:47,260
everyone adds up their points and that's

00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:48,970
how you know who won the game and it's

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,950
just like I was saying can you identify

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,470
a variable or can you identify the

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,870
function so examples questions here

00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,510
might be like what object applies to the

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:01,090
text for body and snake located on line

00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:04,090
50 and so you have to read through there

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:06,010
you look at line 50 and then there's an

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,779
object card that corresponds to that

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:13,659
question and if you play the correct

00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:16,600
object card you get four points these

00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:20,110
are the object cards broke them down

00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:25,690
into operators like add subtract

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:27,039
multiply divide variables groups which

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,529
I'm not completely married to that

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,920
concept but it's basically like classes

00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:35,230
dictionaries lists groups of data

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,240
our cards being there are gonna be some

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,980
error cards thrown in there and if you

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,200
can't identify the error then you lose

00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,880
like all your points or it makes you

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,880
start all over again like an error will

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:52,000
comment cards function cards logic cards

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,140
datatype cards and I kind of bunched a

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
lot of stuff in the logic like if then

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:04,840
for loops while loops all those kind of

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:08,950
like conditional things are on the logic

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:11,230
card but players basically on their

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:14,230
turns try to play the right object card

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,730
to the corresponding code card and when

00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,110
they get them right they get to keep

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,120
them and they get the points and when

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,600
they play them wrong they lose their

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,790
object card which is frustrating because

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,080
then the next time you know something

00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,910
comes around you can't you don't have

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,650
the object card to draw from because

00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,640
you've lost it so part of it is

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,410
throughout the whole game you're trying

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,580
to collect all of the object cards and

00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,690
understand when to use them correctly

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,130
the other thing I really like about this

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,170
game format is when it's not your turn

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,810
you're still learning because you're

00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,790
watching the other players reinforce the

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,890
concepts that you're learning through

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,350
the game so that within the 30 minutes

00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:53,790
or an hour you're gonna get like 60 or

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:59,320
70 different opportunities to reinforce

00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:01,720
understanding these concepts and finally

00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,300
you got you can't have a game if you

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,460
don't have wild cards and so I threw in

00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,550
these entropy cards which are gonna

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,680
basically shuffle the deck and and so

00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,210
some of them are like you trade to

00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,050
object cards to the player to the right

00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,340
or steal all of the function cards from

00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,320
all the players and so everyone

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,120
basically has been waiting to play that

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,620
function card and then you play this and

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,330
they lose their function cards and have

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:31,120
to start all over trying to collect them

00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:33,700
again but this game is really early in

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,100
development still it's just a concept my

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,420
idea is hopefully I could meet some

00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,460
people here at the conference who

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,170
actually know the language well better

00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,700
than I do because I'm just getting

00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,800
started

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:48,520
I need game players

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,500
for feedback and beta testing some video

00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,450
editors for a Kickstarter campaign which

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,900
I hope to do sometime maybe in the next

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,580
year or so technical writers if you're

00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,400
interested in writing documentation for

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,840
the game and if anyone's got some money

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,360
they want to put toward this I think

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,710
it's a valuable effort and I'm not sure

00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,820
if it's going to be a for-profit venture

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,960
or just open source or whatever but I'd

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,130
love to talk to anybody that's

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:19,489
interested thank you

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:19,489
