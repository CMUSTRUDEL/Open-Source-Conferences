00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,119
people very good are you ready to go

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,509

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,509
everyone

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,780
[Music]

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,140
so hands up how many of you have done

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,180
some sort of volunteer programming

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,490
opportunity through code for whatever or

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,110
something like that yeah how many of you

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,080
kind of struggled and had some issues

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,540
with it yeah so I'm here to give you

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,000
some helpful tips on how you can make

00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,470
these things go better I actually work

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
at an immigration nonprofit in

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,770
Washington DC and I've been on both

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,170
sides of these I have been that

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,180
programmer but I have also been the

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,800
person in the nonprofit who's just you

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,980
know hoping we get something we can use

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:21,580
at the end of it so you start off these

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:22,660
things my left arrows button is sticking

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,670
for some reason that I don't know why

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,880
you'd start off thinking you're gonna be

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,920
seen like this as some sort of knight in

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,750
shining armor magic wizard who can solve

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,350
all their problems and you end up

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,300
feeling like these guys why does this

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,640
happen

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,540
conflict of expectations really you want

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,160
time didn't you want time to hack on a

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,170
project outside of work you want

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,060
experience knowing a new library or

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,560
programming language really you want a

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,959
chance to give back to the community and

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,209
like I said all nonprofits all we want

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,270
is a piece of technology that we can use

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,260
that will help us meet our mission so

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,310
step one do a little bit of research

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,890
nonprofit workers were very mission

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,870
driven if you take even 10 minutes to go

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,450
to our website read about what we're

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,110
trying to do it'll help you understand

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,910
us a lot better also you can look for

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,060
key terms that you might not understand

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:21,670
otherwise I work in immigration we speak

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,380
in government acronyms working with

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,500
someone who can kind of understand those

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,810
is really helpful for us and also in

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,570
this category I put set up those initial

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,000
meetings that you have communicate early

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,519
communicate often to find out what the

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,820
nonprofit's goals are and how you can

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,070
best meet them step two is that you have

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,290
to wear all the hats I know at work you

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,700
have PM's you have designers you have

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,560
all these people you're working with but

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,100
frequently in a situation like this it's

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,510
just you so

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,880
you have to be the one to think through

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,980
things like MVPs you have to think about

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,980
accessibility if you have any sort of

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,870
interface another thing to keep in mind

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,580
in this is that you're designing for two

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,980
sets of users so not only do you have to

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,750
think about the end user you have to

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,790
think about the nonprofit workers

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,010
themselves they're the ones who are

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,260
going to have to continue to maintain

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,180
this once you're done and if you're

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,580
lucky you will have someone at the

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,800
nonprofit who will not be confused when

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,230
you say I need you to set up a storage

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,330
bucket for me but that might not always

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,380
be the case so make sure that it's user

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,260
friendly in that respect as well step 3

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,020
explain yourself and what I mean by that

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,080
is that you have to write detailed

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,080
documentation of everything you do both

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,460
for the people at the nonprofit you know

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,310
there's nothing worse than getting that

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,280
email at you know 4:30 in the afternoon

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:50,360
saying I tried to run what you wrote for

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,250
us and it was breaking what do we do the

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,320
good documentation can frequently help

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,590
with that another thing that helps is to

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,630
use lots of open source options because

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,060
those frequently have good documentation

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,910
already they have communities that

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,770
people can go to this actually saved me

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,610
once we had to develop or put something

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,740
together for us

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,900
I couldn't get part of it to work and

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,630
then I realized oh this is an open

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,860
source project from this company I can

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,290
go here and find all of their

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,520
documentation and was able to get that

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:25,640
fixed also in your code comment

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,800
everything make sure that somebody can

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,710
come back and you know know what you

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,240
were trying to do here and one other key

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,210
points that I want to mention in this is

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
that I can pretty much guarantee you

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,550
that people who work at nonprofits are

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,280
not familiar with software licensing do

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,920
us all a favor and just make sure you

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,200
add something in there don't want a

00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,600
non-profit to have problems later on a

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,450
lot of times we like to share projects

00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,850
we've done with partner organizations

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:58,040
and if licensing is already there then

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,520
that's one less thing for everybody to

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,780
worry about like I said nobody from the

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,710
nonprofit's gonna know it

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,680
if you remember it very helpful so a few

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,330
just kind of basic other tips

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,910
under-promise and over-deliver this goes

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,530
back to keeping making an MVP keeping it

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,020
something very simple that you know you

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,730
can do I know it's a side project and

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,110
you're tempted to go but I want to add

00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,340
this and this and these bells and these

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:27,740
whistles don't set boundaries

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,870
you'll be upfront with nonprofits and

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,600
say look I can only work on this on

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,370
weekends maybe one evening a week or

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,400
something like that and this is keep

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,230
follow through make sure that you you

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,419
know only answer your emails in the

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,790
evening and if you leave here with

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,250
nothing else I ask you please whatever

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,320
you do keep it in a state where you can

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,630
walk away at any moment and somebody can

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,460
pick right back up things might go badly

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,710
but as long as somebody can pick up

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,419
where you left off that the nonprofit's

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,340
really appreciate it we have more

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:03,280
respect for you and hopefully everyone

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,280
wins you can see the big hat everyone

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,400
all right Kathleen was exactly on time

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,840
but let's have a little bit of a way of

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,310
encouraging our speakers to get off at

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,950
five minutes so I'll have a little

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,260
practice when I onstage put up one hand

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,300
I want you all to start clapping with

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,770
two fingers like this can you give that

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,010
a practice now just clap with two

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,010
fingers

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,600
normal more everyone just do this two

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,039
fingers see that little sound of

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,750
raindrops that will be the warning to

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,919
the speaker this is their time is up and

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,600
they are allowed to finish their

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,520
sentence and at the end of their

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,690
sentence I'll put up two hands and when

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,020
I put two hands please give them a big

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,020
hand

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,240
all right now we have we have a system

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,620
everyone we have a system so the next

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,389
speaker is Jessica she's talking about

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,129
music and Python I have a strong

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,090
suspicion that the last talk was awesome

00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,409
and that this talk is going to be

00:07:52,090 --> 00:08:00,189
awesome as well as are all the

00:07:53,409 --> 00:08:02,199
subsequent talks give a big and hey

00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,639
how's it goin I'm gonna be talking to

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,819
you guys about how to make music with

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,050
Python and Fox taught the slides for

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,229
this talk are available at my website

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,110
Jessica Garson comm making music with

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:16,180
Python and Foxtrot there's also going to

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,919
be a github repo with the same name and

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,240
we're gonna make a song together and I'm

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,300
gonna be putting the code to make that

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,490
song on that github repo so I'm

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,370
sometimes known as Meza Carson so when I

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,649
was in third grade we learned about

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,719
arson one day and the kids started

00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:37,449
calling me arson garson because my last

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,430
name is Garson and some genius was like

00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:41,589
Messick ah arson cuz I was like I always

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,959
a messy child and I was like man that'd

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:46,000
be such a great punk-rock alter-ego and

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,660
I wasn't even into pop punk yet or

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,910
anything like that

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,560
but then I was like oh cool that would

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,360
be great someday and I never knew what I

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,079
was gonna do with it and now I write

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,560
code and sample myself screaming on top

00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,120
of it

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,070
I used to be in a punk band and now I do

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,540
that and it's really fun and there's

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,490
like a whole scene of other people that

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,709
do it I live in New York and there's

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,610
live code NYC which is really awesome

00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:11,860
and yeah it's really great and so I

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,149
started doing it in Ruby and I like

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,040
Python better I have like a Python

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,680
tattooed on my arm like that's the

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,279
language that I I most identify with and

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,310
I was like yeah oh can I do some Python

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,019
and the answer is yes I can't and so

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,640
there's a library called Fox dot which

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:29,230
allows us to interact with our computer

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,140
just as we were using a synth there's

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,060
like pre-made samples and things like

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,730
that that are pretty awesome and you can

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,860
get this at Fox tat or exhaust

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,890
installation and to launch it you just

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,440
type Python Josh M Fox top with the

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,000
capitalisation like that and you also

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,220
have to start supercollider as well

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,630
since Foxtrot is a wrapper for another

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,550
language that lets you interact with

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,170
your computer through making music and

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,519
one of my favorite things about it is

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,699
that if you go into the menu under

00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,199
tutorials

00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:58,489
was actually code that you could run and

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:00,259
it walks you through how to do it and

00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,850
how I got started doing this was just

00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,459
changing the examples to make it my own

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,189
through the tutorial and it was so bad

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:09,410
um so I'm gonna make some music for you

00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,999
guys in a minute but before that if you

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,129
guys are inspired to make music yourself

00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:16,399
I want to hear what you build to email

00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:20,329
me at Jessica Garson dot-com all right

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,189
Jessica Garcia and gmail.com or my

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:25,279
Twitter handle which is Jessica Garson

00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:26,569
so yeah let's make some music but before

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,669
we do that let's actually see what the

00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:30,669
synthesizers are that we can work with

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:37,339
okay we can kind of see here what we

00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:38,199
have going on and let's get started

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:55,160
making some music

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:56,750
so yes it's working also I make like

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:11,429
weird discordant sounds

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:11,429
[Music]

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,220
[Music]

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:46,789
[Music]

00:11:55,700 --> 00:13:22,670
[Music]

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,780
thanks guys

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,780
[Music]

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,440
amazing fillies up next give him a big

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,010
hand

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,680
[Applause]

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,740
I want to talk for a moment about giving

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,350
thanks in Python hi my name is Philip

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,870
James I worked for patreon and I care a

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,630
lot about supporting and funding and

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:54,350
sustaining open source and so a couple

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:57,210
months ago I saw this tweet from a

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,370
gentleman named Faris who is a node

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,240
developer and he publishes library

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:06,360
called thanks that looks at your NPM dot

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,240
your package JSON and pulls out all the

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,750
people that have a thanks or a donation

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,250
page setup' and at the time I was at PI

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,690
Tennessee which is an amazing regional

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,720
conference if you get a chance to go and

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,580
I thought to myself we'll wait do we

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,470
have this for Python and if we don't

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,300
have this for Python should I build it

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:30,090
for Python so I did over the course of

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,580
PI Tennessee I was inspired by Ferriss

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,280
to build thanks for Python the way it

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,170
works currently you pointed at a

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,960
requirements text file and it looks at a

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,430
local database of package maintainer who

00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,800
I have found on the internet who have

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,680
funding links or thank you links and it

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,500
spits out all of the people in your

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,910
requirements text that are deserving of

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,160
your contribution because you are using

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,120
their software one of the ways that we

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,800
are going to keep open source

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,530
sustainable is by making sure that the

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,480
people whose software we are using get

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,540
credit and where possible get funding

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,310
from us for using their software I am

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,510
going to be sprinting on this somewhat

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,590
I'll be working sprinting with the

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,540
beware group mostly but if you're

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,190
interested in learning more and

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,720
sprinting on it I will be here for

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,860
Sprint's and we can help make this

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,510
better and help grow this part of the

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,240
ecosystem

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:20,820
additionally we got something in Python

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,820
before at the node people got in npm

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,950
which is in the official Python package

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,950
documentation there is now an example of

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,810
how to put a link in your setup PI to

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,560
indicate where you would like funding so

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,720
one of the things I'm going to be

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,250
sprinting on is linking those two things

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,930
so that thinks operates off your setup

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,630
top PI instead of your requirements text

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,180
if you want to that's it thank you very

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,240
much thanks and I hope to have your

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,240
support

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,279
amazing I have a joke

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,130
what do you call what do you call an

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,480
apposite pachyderm

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,760
I'm afraid this joke realized slung me

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,440
on the audience known both the meanings

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,839
of the word opposite and the word

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,250
pachyderm opposite sort of means next to

00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:07,380
or in the right place

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,279
a relevant alright you don't want to

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:15,540
hear for me you want to have him where's

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:18,390
give him a hand good morning I'm Wes

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,100
Wenham founder of woven together we're

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,190
gonna be penetration testing the

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,660
developer interview so I spent the last

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,020
10 years as head of engineering at a

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,600
start-up I did a lot of hiring I screwed

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,460
up a lot and I learned a lot as five

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,290
years ago I was in an interview it was

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,279
going awesome I was super pumped this is

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,650
an important position

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,140
we were geeking out about like our first

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,640
Linux distro he showed me some work he

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,890
did and it was look good he seemed

00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,060
really smart and I was just super

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,450
excited because it was an important

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,850
position

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,890
fast forward nine months I was not

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,020
excited he had gone very poorly

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,660
I learned that I'd used some heuristics

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,190
and those heuristics had proven that

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,070
this person was a really good report

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,440
builder and communicator but maybe not

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,240
so good at the job that needed to do and

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,670
that was my fault like I made that

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,949
mistake

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,329
so in penetration testing you attack a

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,220
system so that you can learn how to

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,620
defend it we're gonna attack the

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,120
interview process and it's really

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,530
vulnerable guys so a heuristic is a rule

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,240
of thumb that kind of works in the

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,959
specific context but out of that context

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,760
that's wrong

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,939
so heuristics are our primary

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,220
vulnerabilities in the interview process

00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:31,140
we're gonna exploit them a baton the

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,960
ball cost a dollar in ten cents

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,310
in total the bat costs one dollar more

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,679
than the ball how much does the ball

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,190
cost when everyone get an answer in your

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:44,610
head so you're probably thinking 10

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,460
cents 10 cents is simple intuitive and

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,679
completely wrong it was ten cents would

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,630
be a dollar 20 and it's wrong so 80% of

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,820
people say ten cents on this one let's

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,070
do another one Linda is a 31 year olds

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,070
is 31 years old single outspoken and

00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,899
very bright

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,279
majored in philosophy as a student she

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:03,490
was deeply concerned with issues of

00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,899
discrimination and social justice she

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,019
also participated in anti-nuclear

00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:11,350
demonstrations which is more probable

00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:13,059
one Linda is a librarian - Linda is a

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,950
librarian and is active in the feminist

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:20,830
movement one thing for a second 80% of

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,779
people say to the feminist librarian but

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,669
if you think a little farther that's

00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,409
impossible every feminist librarian is

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:30,039
also a librarian it must be more

00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:32,019
probable that she's a librarian let's do

00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,980
a more relevant one okay so on the Left

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:38,620
we have a resume that has an extra math

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,419
degree it has the same experience same

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,309
project and it has like a number which

00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,139
is nice we like numbers right on the

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,580
right less experienced you know same

00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:48,610
experience but they use an action verb

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:52,809
to start the sentence who thinks the

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:55,480
left resume gets more calls backs few

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:57,909
hands go up the right resume gets twice

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,250
as many callbacks in real life twice as

00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:03,519
many like a second degree and an action

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,320
verb beats it so the moral of this story

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,240
is use action verbs and also apply on

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,559
Monday morning versus Friday afternoon

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,059
because you get a 5 times better

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,509
callback rate it's crazy

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:15,700
this thing is so broken our attack

00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:17,980
vector is stories right so Linda the

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,600
feminist librarian is a better story the

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,509
starting list ends with an action verb

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,250
resume is a better story as an attacker

00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:26,139
we're trying to implant this story into

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,419
the mind of the interviewer we're

00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:30,940
exploiting the availability heuristic on

00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,009
the left is an fMRI from someone that's

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,960
listening to a list of information and

00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:36,519
processing it on the right that lit up

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,470
brain that's somebody that's hearing a

00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,279
story they're really engaging with it

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,929
stories are like the attack vector when

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,740
you're building a resume you want to be

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,450
the feminist librarian tell a story use

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,029
action verbs and start your sentence

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,750
with action verbs on a phone screen the

00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:57,100
heuristics heuristics are great for most

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,279
people don't have phone screen rubrics

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,049
it's just all gut feel so you're there

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,730
heuristics are very vulnerable the

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,950
biggest heuristics are excitement and

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,690
confidence so excitement you should

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,280
smile while you talk on a phone screen

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,110
people can hear it

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,790
sounds different do some jumping jacks

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,640
before it's stupid that we have to do

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,200
this but that's what works for

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,750
confidence asking questions about

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,160
questions signals confidence you can

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,980
also do this trick where you repeat the

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,540
last three words a difficult co-worker

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,250
and then you answer your question it

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,620
signals confidence there's also this

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,950
power move the stall technique or you

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,270
just say that's a good question hmm

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,530
and then you answer and you're now

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,090
confident and people are like this

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,290
confident person would be really good at

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:43,210
this job you can also ask some standard

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,740
questions and mirror so when I say

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,970
mirror if someone was talking and

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,320
they're super excited like me you should

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,100
also talk and be really super excited

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,110
but if they were more reserved and

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,880
thoughtful you should be more reserved

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,510
and thoughtful mirror they're talking

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,640
speed this really really works take home

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,260
tests this is the heuristic there is

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,280
does this code look like my code most

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,700
people don't have rubrics because

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,740
rubrics are super hard and when you

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,360
spend time you probably get it you're

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,790
probably in an untimed take-home test

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,560
aka recommended time and it's like give

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,750
this back in three days you should plan

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,790
on spending three to five times they'll

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,500
recommend a time to get that job most

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,360
the people get that job spend more time

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,310
that's just the way it is you have to

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,200
play that to get that game and we need

00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,700
that extra time don't like build extra

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,280
features and cool stuff and like add a

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,810
REST API polish Polish polish make that

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,540
code the most polished code you've ever

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,240
produced step away refactor also quick

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,490
turnaround quick turnaround time signals

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,930
excitement so if it's like give this

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,820
back to me in four days get it back in

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,500
one day and if you can't do that set

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,760
expectations like I'm on a vacation and

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,440
I can't get the back and then beat those

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,440
expectations that signals like

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,690
excitement for a job I mean then follow

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,130
up this is an easy one Cinda like a 15

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,450
minute email where you say like if I had

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,070
more time I would do this and thanks for

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,020
the opportunity and that signals like

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,600
excitement and enthusiasm and you're

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,120
like a go-getter I'm gonna be at startup

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,380
row all day today if you would like to

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,360
talk about developer hiring and

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,320
interviewing I would love to talk to you

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,320
thanks everyone

00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:17,720
thanks where's up next we have Dorota

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,389
who's here to talk to us about

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,629
versioning your data give her a big hand

00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,629
please

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,520
so my name is Delta this is my first

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,060
bike on my face liking talk so thank you

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,060
for coming

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,530
so I will be talking about that a lot

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,650
it's a tool that allows your vibration

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,960
in your data so we all love get for

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,080
various reasons but I want to talk about

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,150
two features here so first of all agate

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,100
has distributed structures so basically

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,620
it means that content is available

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,840
across all copies of the repositories it

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,090
is also very efficient for managing the

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,890
textual information so it can start very

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,800
efficiently like thousand of version of

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,110
your code but if you have like ten kid

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,790
of data those two features are not as

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,740
great anymore and especially the first

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,620
one that the content is available across

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,450
all copies of the repository so we all

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,090
know about this and we just simply don't

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,760
commit 10 gig of data and we definitely

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,970
don't push 10 gig of data to our github

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,920
repository but at the end we're treating

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,800
data as a second-class citizen within

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,070
our software platforms so you were using

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,810
tables for to distribute it we don't

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,580
have any like code versioning where it's

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,970
not really testing and it's very

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,130
difficult to show you at the end so if

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,440
you are using data and you would like to

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,840
treat your data in a similar way as you

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,540
are treating your code would get I think

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,390
you might want to attract this to tolls

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,820
its keep our necks and data a lot so it

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,370
panic is built on top of git it allows

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,040
managing files with get without actually

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,830
checking the content of the fight for in

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,980
target so it only commits the symbolic

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:05,500
links to device it also adds special

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,210
remotes so it can provide access to data

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,530
content from various sources including

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:13,210
web s3 Dropbox and many others and data

00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,850
that is the second tool I want to talk

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,480
about a needs arise both on get and get

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,280
Alex

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,740
it can also organize multiple

00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,430
repositories within one super datasets

00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,730
it can aggregate also datasets meta

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,010
metadata

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,370
so they can be very useful if you want

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:33,010
to make like efficient search among many

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,930
datasets and what is especially nice for

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,300
this code it comes not only with

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,880
command-line interface but also with

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,250
Python interface

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,500
so I would just present like I've just

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:48,510
shown you a small example when I was

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:53,440
using data in my work so at some point

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:55,870
let me so at some point I had to provide

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,590
data sets with the output of like a

00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:02,320
specific pipeline and I put all of my

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,600
data to Dropbox but in order to share my

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,470
data and have like proper version ink

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:12,880
I also create a github repository like I

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:17,140
created data get data set and write a

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:22,169
POTUS to github so you can see here this

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:26,110
is my this is my github and I if I go

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:28,120
deep inside of my structure you will see

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,130
that I have like many different files

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,140
but if I click on the file you will see

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,880
that there is no content of the file but

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,580
it's just symbolic link to the content

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,010
to tell it to the file in the Dropbox so

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,730
but because I have this repository I can

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:45,730
go to my trip eternal book I can make it

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,790
bigger I can install I can import data

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:54,190
lat API and I can insert the state

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:55,450
assets so by clicking here it's like it

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,669
took like less than seconds because

00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,440
basically it's not the rounding I need

00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,410
content and simply inserting the data

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,299
set I can make it even bigger so here

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,419
you can see that I have like now in my

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:10,210
in my file system like hundreds of of

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:11,830
symlinks but no content I can also track

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,350
like at the content of specific

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,809
directories and if I found that a fight

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:20,200
that I really needed I can just down on

00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:22,570
this specific file so now it's the it's

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,480
the place that data rod is actually

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:28,030
downloading the file and it it's like 18

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,280
mega so it will take like 10 seconds but

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,010
imagine how frustrated it would be if I

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:40,020
have to like download the content of

00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:40,020
entire data set so here like ok sorry

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:48,299
so with data out you can be like you can

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:52,070
download it one at at the same time like

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:55,429
entire like dataset entire like one

00:26:52,070 --> 00:27:05,190
directory or just one one specific file

00:26:55,429 --> 00:27:08,580
it was faster in the morning okay so I

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,830
will come back to this so if you if you

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,859
actually find this like useful you might

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:17,309
wanna check the title at website to

00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:21,090
fight like more feature on data both

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,980
data and get annex are open source so if

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,950
you wanna work on this you can and you

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,639
can check the github and and work with

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:32,840
main main developers okay this is stuck

00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:35,220
but it will be good thank you

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,499
thanks very much Dorota we have one

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,179
final speaker for you won't final

00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,529
lightning talk Terry would you like to

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:48,509
take it away first please give her a big

00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:50,279
hand hi I'm Terry and I'm one of the

00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,350
people who runs Python summer mentoring

00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,799
program and I'm here to tell you that we

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:58,019
need you all of you

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,629
so we participate in something called

00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:03,119
Google Summer of Code which is a global

00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:05,309
online mentoring program for university

00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,509
students that runs every summer in North

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:12,019
American summer the way it works is

00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:15,299
Google pays the students we provide

00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:17,639
mentoring and ideas and the students

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,989
give us code it's pretty awesome it's a

00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,519
great way to get new contributors to

00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,139
your project it's a great way for

00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,470
students to get an introduction to open

00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:26,549
source and make some money

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,590
Python has been participating for the

00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,629
past ten years as what we call an

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,029
umbrella org which means rather than

00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:35,279
just sponsoring projects related to the

00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:37,259
development of the Python language we

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,389
also sponsor a whole bunch of other

00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,700
groups that use Python for interesting

00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:45,600
things be it security lots of science

00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,779
and each of these groups could apply on

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,009
their own but often they think oh we're

00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,929
really small I don't want to deal with

00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:52,559
all this paperwork let's have Python do

00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,110
it for us

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,879
or they think we've never done a

00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,950
mentoring program before it would be

00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:02,009
really nice if we had some help some

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:04,409
advice some support and we do that too

00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:06,929
and often people say well we wanted to

00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,399
start with this and then once we've got

00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:11,820
a little bit of experience we can go and

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,730
do it on our own so in our biggest year

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,830
we had over 70 students and this year we

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,929
have 15 and that's not a bad thing

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,700
that's a sign that a lot of the sub orgs

00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:22,740
who had been working with us have grown

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,139
up grown their wings and gone on on

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,940
their own but this means we've got a

00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,570
great opportunity for people we have a

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,330
whole lot of space for new sub works so

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,610
when I say we need you I'm talking about

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,950
I'd like to find some new open source

00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,629
projects working in Python who'd be

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,909
interested in doing some mentorship

00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:47,190
getting new contributors having a good

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:48,809
time if you're interested basically you

00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,639
need to be a Python open source project

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,230
we ask you to have three people and

00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:53,820
people often are like we don't need

00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,230
three people I can mentor a student all

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,730
by myself and that's fine but what if

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,409
you get sick or what if you get hit by a

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:01,559
car that actually happened to someone I

00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:03,360
hope it'll never happen it but this

00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,860
gives you some backup and it gives the

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,080
students a few extra people to talk to

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,820
if they need different advice or they

00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,419
just want to want to have some other

00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,490
opinions and you need a set of ideas for

00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,529
something that a student can do in three

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,240
months and we can help with that it's

00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:20,279
it's a little bit hard to figure out

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,379
what's a good size project and we have a

00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,110
lot a lot in fact ten years of

00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:28,039
experience doing that so we can help you

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,600
can read all about it on our website

00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:33,929
it's got a whole lot of extra advice and

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,909
what it means to be a mentor every time

00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,990
I put out a call for open source

00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:39,360
projects I get a whole lot of

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,429
individuals to say hey I'm not part of

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,320
any open source project but I really

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:44,850
want to help what should I do

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,580
and I'm gonna tell you right now that

00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,960
the easiest way to get involved is to

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,119
join an open source project that's

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,850
participating the best mentors are the

00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,950
ones who actually are experienced in

00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,929
their projects and aren't trying to ramp

00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:01,470
up at the same time of the students but

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:03,330
if you need some suggestions send me an

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,250
email I can often match you up to a

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,870
project that says hey we'd like to

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,130
participate

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,620
we don't quite have enough contributors

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,700
yet maybe there's someone who's waiting

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,970
just for you

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:18,050
and if all of that sounds like way too

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:20,030
much work we've got a really easy

00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:22,340
volunteer opportunity for everyone in

00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,290
the audience right now the students have

00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,570
just are just starting their code on

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,370
Monday and they're gonna be posting blog

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,890
posts and we want to make them feel

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,960
really welcome to show them that this is

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,360
a huge community of really enthusiastic

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,800

marvelous conference organizer Ernest W

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:30,930
Dubin the third I'm not exactly sure

00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:34,160
who's referencing so all right thank you

all right so this morning we have two

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,240
keynotes for you but before we get into

00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,090
those I just wanted to remind everybody

00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,920
about the PyCon code of conduct the link

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,870
right there is where you can go to find

00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:50,700
all the information about it and the

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:52,680
contact information is also on screen if

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,400
you need to make a report you can report

00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,350
to anything there or this doesn't seem

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,960
there we go or to somebody wearing one

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:07,050
of these shirts again the contact

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,629
information is no know it now it's

00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:13,590
working okay is right there so snap a

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:16,050
picture and or find that on the site it

00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:19,470
looks like there was some confusion

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:23,040
about the junior ballroom versus the

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:25,379
global Center Ballroom those are these

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,870
names are both for the same place so for

00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:31,230
signage and for stuff in your program

00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:33,000
that's where that is it's sort of up

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,500
these stairs and right out in this

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,159
atrium here if you had a hard time

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,290
finding that yesterday the PyCon Fun Run

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,659
that's gonna be occurring tomorrow

00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,070
morning shuttles will begin to parting

00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,230
from the lake side entrance that

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,940
direction at 5:30 in the morning and run

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,030
every 10 minutes so if you're running

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,500
the PyCon Fun Run walk you can go catch

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:58,260
the shuttle there to go out to the

00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:01,190
course yeah that's it did anybody have a

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,190
good first day at PyCon

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,500
all right well we're gonna get our

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,290
second day started off with the keynote

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,750
our first keynote of the morning is Ying

00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:16,840
Lee Ying Lee is a software engineer

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,550
focus on security at docker a speaker at

00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,130
PyCon in the past and a longtime

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:32,950
contributor to the twisted project I'm

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:35,710
excited to welcome to Sage Ying Lee hi

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,420
all as inner said my name is Ying this

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:45,070
is my first keynote so thank you all for

00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:47,200
coming so I'm a software engineer at

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,140
docker and I develop security features

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,750
for their projects and products prior to

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,240
docker I worked on from most recently to

00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,280
least distributed systems front-end

00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,580
JavaScript and mobile games using the

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,840
Unity game platform so I had no previous

00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:06,580
experience whatsoever in security but

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,900
I'm the kind of person who takes first

00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,850
aid classes and gets regular

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,620
vaccinations because I want to

00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:14,320
contribute to the common good of Public

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,480
Health I've also always been interested

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,060
in personal security best practices

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,000
because if someone compromises one of my

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,970
own personal machines or accounts not

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,920
only is my personal information at risk

00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,630
but it puts my friends at risk too if

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,250
they have ever given me any of their

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,840
personal information similarly I felt

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,390
that I should learn about security

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,520
because more developers knowing about

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,580
security issues is better for the

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,220
software ecosystem as a whole if someone

00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,780
compromises my application server I'm

00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,900
gonna have a really bad couple of days

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,850
at work but also at the very least an

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,100
attacker could use that server as a

00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,830
platform to attack other perhaps

00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,960
critical systems and at worst I've put

00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,900
all of my users at risk of targeted

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,340
phishing or identity theft so it's

00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,290
worthwhile for me to reduce the

00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:09,610
likelihood of that happening or at least

00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:11,440
mitigate the damage if that happened so

00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,990
I found some extremely talented suckers

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,720
I'm sorry awesome Mentors

00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:20,020
coworkers to teach me a total newbie

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,369
some security engineering so I found it

00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,280
to be really interesting and meaningful

00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,170
work and diving into the deep ocean of

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,040
information security was absolutely the

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:32,410
right decision for me but everyone here

00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,540
should care about security and that

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,640
doesn't mean that everyone has to follow

00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,880
me into a security focused engineering

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,460
role you can each make a big difference

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,520
to security by caring about it and by

00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,400
following a few basic checklists you

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,860
don't need to be an expert I want to

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,810
convince you that everyone involved in

00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,420
the creation of software or the

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:57,700
operation of software systems has an

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,860
important part to play to make the world

00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:04,060
of software a safer and more secure

00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:06,160
place it's sort of like how you don't

00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,860
have to be a medical professional to be

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,800
a parent keeping a tiny human being

00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,630
alive is a really big responsibility and

00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,000
you'd think that extensive medical

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,830
training would be a prerequisite but if

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,070
that were the case our species would be

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:23,800
extinct so my partner and I recently had

00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,960
a kid and not only do neither of us have

00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,310
medical training I'd never even held a

00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,109
baby prior to my own but so far and keep

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,170
in mind the baby is pretty young all

00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:38,050
we've done is make use of basic child

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:41,290
care information and checklists feed the

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:44,010
baby clothe the baby bathe the baby give

00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,600
them a nap repeat repeat repeat

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,460
other than that we check in with a

00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,920
doctor at recommended intervals and

00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,950
whenever the baby is sick and injured I

00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,840
also ask fellow parents for advice when

00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,670
I don't know what to do but the

00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:03,150
situation clearly does not require a

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:03,150
doctor yet and the baby's still alive

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,850
we'd certainly like to think that has

00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:14,500
parents yes I kept a baby alive we'd

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,510
certainly like to think that as parents

00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,880
we can make a big difference to our kids

00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,460
by caring about them and following these

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,780
basic checklists we don't all need to be

00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:28,120
doctors basic application security is a

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,700
lot like this you don't have to be able

00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:34,870
to hack into a web server to know that

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:36,520
notes to know that you shouldn't bypass

00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,100
the security features that Django

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,440
provides by defaults you don't have to

00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,110
know the full TLS handshake in order to

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,150
get the lock icon on your website you

00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,950
can just read the excellent tutorials on

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,430
setting up your web server by even

00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:54,340
ristic of SSL labs or Hana colic of Pike

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:56,800
on Fame you don't need to go to black

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,630
hat or Def Con to keep up with security

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,190
updates on your system or to keep up

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:05,500
with security updates for your software

00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:07,180
dependencies for security design reviews

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,640
and reviews of particularly critical

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,920
code or when you actually have a

00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,050
compromised you can call in someone with

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:19,180
more expertise but you don't need that

00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:20,950
expertise every day it's pretty scary to

00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,650
be responsible for something you have no

00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,830
experience or expertise in especially

00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,210
for something that seems very important

00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:30,970
but it's something that everyone can do

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,160
with the proper support system I think

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,390
that the Python community which is

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,520
already extremely friendly and

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,700
supportive to newcomers can be that

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,560
support system in fact I feel so

00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,330
confident in the supportiveness of this

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,370
community and that I feel comfortable

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,930
showing you a little project that I've

00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:51,250
been working on it's something I've

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:54,580
never done before so my kid really likes

00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,720
books and in a couple of years I'd like

00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,840
to be able to tell them a little bit

00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,760
about what I do I figured I'd run my

00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,340
idea for a children's book by all of you

00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,290
here first before I start pitching it to

00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,030
publishers because I've never written a

00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,760
children's book and really I'm a little

00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:14,010
nervous about it so okay it's called the

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,010
professor of Oz here goes

00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:20,500
house of pops is a Kansas based company

00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:25,359
whose website lets people sell lollipops

00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:27,670
and cake pops dolores is a web developer

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,770
at house of pops dolores has been

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:33,490
working very hard on a new feature that

00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:38,230
lets users share and compare recipes she

00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:40,329
falls asleep after a long day dolores

00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,910
wakes up in a strange and colorful land

00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:48,130
that definitely is not Kansas when

00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:53,920
suddenly poof a stranger appears before

00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:58,210
her welcome to the land of zero days or

00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,039
O's for short I'm Gwen a good hacker who

00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,010
finds her reports vulnerabilities and

00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:05,380
software house of pops is vulnerable to

00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:13,359
server-side template injection which can

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:16,470
be escalated which can be escalated into

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,470
a full remote code execution

00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:24,640
Onoda Laura says this is terrible

00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,410
I was really making good progress on my

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,930
feature I don't want to drop everything

00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:33,819
to fix this I just want to finish my

00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:36,430
recipe sharing feature Gwen says oh is

00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:37,900
is also full of evil hackers who will

00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:40,359
take advantage of these vulnerabilities

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,640
instead of reporting them you may

00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:45,299
already be a target so you should fix

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,099
this as soon as possible

00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:50,200
maybe you should go to tool town and ask

00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,720
the professor who lives there for a tool

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,560
that can secure your site just follow

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,060
this gray asphalt road

00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,360
[Music]

00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:04,090
Gwen disappears in another puff of smoke

00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:08,460
as Dolores walks down the road

00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,460
she meets Tim their DevOps engineer a

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,240
remote code execution vulnerability on

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,220
the web server means that everything on

00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,520
our private network is at risk our

00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:21,100
logging server our email server our CI

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,410
server how can we protect all of our

00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,020
infrastructure

00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:28,090
Delores says I don't know but I'm going

00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:32,440
to go ask the professor for help why

00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:35,650
don't you come with me a little further

00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,620
on they run into Sakura a data scientist

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,360
who works at house of pops our customer

00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,210
information and business projections are

00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,640
on that network if customer data gets

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:49,050
leaked our customers won't ever trust us

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,970
again how can we protect all of our data

00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:53,440
Delores says we're going to ask the

00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,990
professor about how to protect our

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,000
application and our infrastructure come

00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:02,920
with us and we can ask about protecting

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:09,010
your data to a little further down the

00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:10,930
road they sealeo their test engineer we

00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,730
can add a regression test for the fix

00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:14,950
but how can we be sure there won't be a

00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,200
different remote code execution bug in

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,540
the future

00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,250
Delores says I don't know but we're

00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,750
going to go ask the professor about

00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,270
protecting our website our

00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:28,090
infrastructure and all of our data from

00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:29,560
this vulnerability come with us and ask

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,940
about protection from future

00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:36,010
vulnerabilities too they finally reach

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,280
tool town and find their way to the

00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,870
professor please professor they ask can

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,060
you give us a tool that will protect our

00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:44,940
application our infrastructure and our

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:49,000
data from all remote code execution

00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:51,820
vulnerabilities maybe a firewall the

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,530
professor replies no there's nothing

00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,530
that will protect you from all remote

00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:58,780
code execution x' a firewall can protect

00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,850
you from some vulnerabilities but it has

00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,800
a lot of drawbacks and it's also

00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:04,900
possible that you've already been

00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,220
attacked and a firewall won't help you

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:12,490
then oh no everyone from house of

00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:15,070
exclaims our competitor sweetcakes was

00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,990
attacked last month all their recipes

00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:24,010
were deleted and their servers were used

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:26,410
to mind candy coin it took them over a

00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,410
week to restore everything and they lost

00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:33,790
a lot of users how can we fix this as

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:35,710
soon as possible well the professor says

00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,380
Gwen reported that you have a

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,820
server-side template injection this is a

00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,680
part of a larger class of

00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,050
vulnerabilities called injection flaws

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,000
where a user provides some malicious

00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,700
input that is treated as code to be

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,990
executed instead of the plain text that

00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:54,640
it should be treated as Deloris you

00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,760
already have the tools to fix this

00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,160
easily your web framework automatically

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,500
escapes all text and template parameters

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,080
you just have to use those parameters

00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:07,230
instead of manually using string

00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:10,900
interpolation by yourself

00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:14,020
great Dolores says and hey this library

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,480
will escape text in sequel two if I use

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,150
parameters I won't have to do all the

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,310
scaping manually because sometimes I

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:26,290
forget and it's not always caught in

00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:28,270
code review Tim says I can look through

00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,250
our logs and our database for malicious

00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,859
user entries to see if an attacker has

00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,780
already tried this but if they did I'm

00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:39,250
going to have to rebuild all of our

00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:41,440
servers the professor says yes but when

00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,089
you do you'll already have the tools to

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,089
prevent an attacker from getting from

00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:47,650
one server to another the next time you

00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:49,750
already have a private network to

00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:52,810
prevent outside access to most of your

00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,940
servers with multiple private networks a

00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,400
server can have only the minimal access

00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:59,290
it needs to other servers so an attacker

00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,800
can't move from one to the next to the

00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:04,930
next that's right Tim says our web

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,180
server Jupiter servers an email server

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,180
don't need to communicate at all a

00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,680
little while later Sakura says my

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,510
Jupiter servers are now in a different

00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,089
network but what about all the data that

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:22,810
I use the web server needs to write logs

00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:24,610
and push metrics the professor says

00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,220
you already have the tools to limit the

00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:29,140
damage a web server can do it doesn't

00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,750
need to be to read or update those logs

00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,520
and you could also delete any old data

00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,860
that you no longer need that you've

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,830
finished analyzing so there'd be no way

00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:41,620
an attacker can get to it

00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:43,770
Sakura says huh we can run a cron job

00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,810
that deletes data older than six months

00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,640
also talk to Dolores about anonymizing

00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,220
and limiting the data that we collect as

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,440
well I don't need to identify customers

00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:59,110
I just need aggregate information leo

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,210
says Dolores and I added an automated

00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:04,150
test for this input but there are a lot

00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,910
of inputs that we need to test the

00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,530
professor replies you already run a

00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,230
linter on your code and Jenkins

00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,910
you can add static analysis static code

00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,670
analysis tools that will look for

00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,900
injection vulnerabilities too you can

00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,090
combine this with a code review

00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,370
checklist to make sure that reviewers

00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:26,050
check for string interpolation when they

00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:28,210
look at PRS leo says and maybe we can

00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,340
run an attackers web scanner against our

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,050
staging instance so that we can find

00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:36,610
vulnerabilities before our code is

00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:38,680
deployed to production finally a little

00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:41,170
while later the house of pop team

00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,910
finishes their work yay

00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,530
after looking through all the logs Tim

00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:47,320
says that we've escaped attacked this

00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:50,080
time our patched app has been redeployed

00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:55,750
and our new tests pass we appear to be

00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:59,320
secure they high-five the professor

00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:01,810
replies hmm not quite security is a

00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:05,380
process not a checkbox so you're never

00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:07,150
secure because you're never finished but

00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,820
you've done a fantastic job improving

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:14,230
your processes so far you have to keep

00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:16,000
it up Gwen says until next time because

00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:23,200
there will always be you next time and

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:25,750
throws another smoke bomb and Delores

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,070
wakes up with a start in bed she can't

00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:31,120
wait to talk to her coworkers and that's

00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,930
all I have so far

00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,930
what do you

00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:42,109
Thanks

00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:49,229
so do you all think that's a little

00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:50,670
advanced for a toddler that's the

00:49:49,229 --> 00:49:52,679
feedback I've gotten from friends so far

00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:56,189
that I I really need to write some

00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:59,069
prequels first maybe software for babies

00:49:56,189 --> 00:50:04,799
or the automated testing spin-off baby

00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:07,319
loves continuous integration but it also

00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:09,179
needs a real ending a happily ever after

00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:11,729
because every children's story needs a

00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:13,979
happily ever after I know the ending

00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:15,749
that I'd like to have what happens after

00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:18,179
Delores heads into work and tells her

00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:22,219
co-workers about her dream but I need

00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:25,499
your help to make that ending possible

00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:28,259
so JetBrains and the PSF surveyed over

00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:32,579
9,500 Python developers at the end of

00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:33,959
2017 in 150 countries and it had some

00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:38,429
interesting insights into the

00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:40,709
participants developer roles in my story

00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:43,319
Delores is primarily a web developer

00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:46,019
like 26% of the Python developers

00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:48,329
surveyed but she actually represents all

00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:52,140
application or library developers not

00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:54,119
just web in my happily ever after these

00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,339
developers become more familiar with the

00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,009
more common classes of vulnerabilities

00:50:56,339 --> 00:51:01,920
that affect them injection of untrusted

00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:04,559
data broken authentication and leaking

00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,209
sensitive information as well as what

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:10,019
kind of controls are needed to mitigate

00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:12,089
these vulnerabilities using frameworks

00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:15,029
or libraries that provide tooling like

00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:17,489
auto escaping user input and user models

00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:20,249
for authorization makes these things

00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:22,019
easier but the developer still needs to

00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:24,749
be aware of these features and avoid

00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:26,489
bypassing them if they can't use any of

00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:28,469
this tooling then they will need to

00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:31,519
learn more about the different specific

00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:34,109
instances of these vulnerabilities and

00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,949
the control mechanisms needed to

00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:39,119
validate or escape input from users

00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:41,519
validate credentials and permissions

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,009
before every single user operation and

00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:47,279
redact and protect any sensitive data

00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:49,140
that they return or display a wasp or

00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:51,660
the open web application security

00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:54,890
project is a great learning resource if

00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,890
a developer must do so

00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:01,589
27% of Python users focus on data

00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:04,609
science either data analysis or machine

00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:07,140
learning data scientists like Sakura

00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:08,490
take great care to make sure that their

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,190
models are accurate and their

00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:13,079
conclusions are sound but too often

00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,420
these days the data they use is

00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,760
collected in a single increasingly large

00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,190
and increasingly vulnerable pile on the

00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,540
off chance that it might be useful if

00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,730
there's a breach

00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,010
not only could valuable business data be

00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,320
stolen by competitors but personal data

00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:30,270
could be exposed to criminals making the

00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:34,070
people in the data sets more vulnerable

00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:37,020
to fishing hacking and identity theft in

00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,720
the happily ever after that I envision

00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,550
Sakura and all data scientists limit the

00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,619
collection of data and restrict access

00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:46,200
to that data to the systems that

00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:48,780
actually need to process it this doesn't

00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,670
have to be very draconian it should be

00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,099
easy to ask for access to the data

00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,720
needed for analysis but the request

00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,000
should be specific as to the type of

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,920
data needed and how long it's needed for

00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,760
and no additional data should be

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,869
provided at for that particular request

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,050
data that's no longer needed for

00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:13,710
analysis should be deleted so it cannot

00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:15,780
be exposed if there is ever a breach 9%

00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,230
of Python users focus on devops

00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:21,359
administration or automation a

00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:23,460
compromise of a system is inevitable

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,160
because it's impossible to make a system

00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,500
impenetrable but it is possible to make

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,970
a system resilience and to make it more

00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,920
difficult for an attacker to move

00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:36,150
laterally through a system once they've

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,670
compromised a single point a my happily

00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,400
ever after Tim and all administrators

00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:43,560
reduce the likelihood of compromised by

00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,380
regularly and automatically applying

00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,990
security updates and they mitigate the

00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:51,050
damage a single compromise can cause by

00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:53,190
isolating components from each other

00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,650
putting them on separate networks is

00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,930
good and sandboxing the applications is

00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:01,170
good for example using containers or

00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:03,240
virtualization if communication between

00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:05,400
components is needed it should be

00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,369
through secured authenticated channels

00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,130
like TLS each component should be

00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:11,380
provided

00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:16,420
with the minimal access to anything else

00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:18,880
that it needs according to the survey

00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:22,660
only 3% of Python developers aren't

00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,880
testing but everyone here has to verify

00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:28,230
that their code somehow works right

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,730
predict preferably in an automated way

00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,950
well a my happily ever after

00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:35,829
security is viewed as part of software

00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:37,900
quality test for security should be part

00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:40,720
of your automated tests along with

00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,079
everything else all your other automated

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,079
tests

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,650
this can include custom validation and

00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,440
authentication tests that you write

00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:53,529
yourself this can include using fuzzing

00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,750
tools for input that you accept using

00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:58,809
custom verification a configuration

00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:02,019
verification tools like SSL labs or CF

00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:06,460
SSL scanners against a deployed instance

00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:08,890
of your code can include using static

00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:13,269
code analysis tools like bandit or

00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:15,640
Python taint on your code or dynamic

00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:18,099
code analysis tools like BDD security

00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,700
again against a deployed instance of

00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:23,500
your application tests don't catch every

00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,509
bug and these security tools won't

00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,609
either but they can help prevent

00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:30,670
regressions and may signal an area of

00:55:27,609 --> 00:55:32,230
code that needs more review or a class

00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:37,809
of ulnar ability that you may have

00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:40,990
overlooked 9 percent of Python users are

00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:43,170
focused on education in my happily ever

00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,789
after when teaching software development

00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:48,220
educators will bring up security early

00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:50,170
and often students should learn to think

00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,779
about the security implications of their

00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,880
system designs and code as much as they

00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:57,569
think about performance concurrency

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,980
quality or documentation I'm

00:55:57,569 --> 00:56:02,410
particularly fond of formal threat

00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,660
modeling so students learn how to think

00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:06,609
about securing their system since there

00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,480
will always be new attacks even if we

00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:12,519
eliminate the most prevalent ones today

00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,319
formal threat model can formal threat

00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,359
model and can teach them to think about

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:20,759
the different vectors and the different

00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:20,759
entry points a system can be attacked

00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:25,759
in fact I think the system analysis part

00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,009
of formal threat modeling is a very

00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:32,419
useful thing for Dolores Sakura

00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:34,880
tin and Leo to all do as well system

00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:36,880
analysis means enumerate all the data

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,409
the system system collects and

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,749
understanding how that data flows

00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:44,119
through the system it means asking

00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:47,419
questions like where's the input

00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:49,189
accepted where's data stored how does

00:56:47,419 --> 00:56:52,099
data travel from one component to

00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:55,880
another what sort of privilege is needed

00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:57,529
to access that data making system

00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,989
analysis part of the house of pops

00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:02,839
process would let Delores figure out

00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:05,899
where untrusted input comes from in the

00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:07,999
system would let Sakura figure out which

00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:11,119
pieces of data are needed and whether

00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:13,099
access has been restricted would let Tim

00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,189
determine which components can be

00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:19,069
segregated and would give Leo a set of

00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:21,499
requirements that he could test for as a

00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:23,599
bonus the system analysis serves as a

00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:28,159
very useful piece of documentation for

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,569
onboarding new developers if we want to

00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:33,039
improve the state of software security

00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:36,380
we need to care but it can seem daunting

00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:38,529
aside from the commonality of really

00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,880
understanding how the system should work

00:57:38,529 --> 00:57:42,319
each of my characters has their own

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,289
little checklist that they need to

00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:47,509
follow there's no one super checklist

00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:50,079
that anyone can follow to have

00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:52,669
guaranteed perfect security every time

00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,489
there always seem to be new protocols

00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:57,259
and best practices to learn more options

00:57:55,489 --> 00:58:01,549
that can be said and that can get really

00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:03,469
discouraging and sometimes they can feel

00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:05,359
like following simple rules that prevent

00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:07,279
issues like template injection is not

00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,489
worth it because there's always some

00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:12,229
scary ultra advanced attack in the news

00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:13,939
but as much as advanced attacks are real

00:58:12,229 --> 00:58:15,559
threats and researchers and

00:58:13,939 --> 00:58:17,089
infrastructure developers will keep

00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:20,449
working on ways to defend against them

00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:23,329
the basics matter a lot and consistently

00:58:20,449 --> 00:58:25,729
doing security basics well can have huge

00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:28,279
positive consequences because attackers

00:58:25,729 --> 00:58:30,999
won't always be using ultra advanced

00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:35,259
attacks they will probably stick with

00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:35,259
tried-and-true ones that still work

00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,380
since we're talking about consequences

00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,510
let's talk about the most serious

00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,430
consequence and another area we're

00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:46,250
getting the basics right can make a huge

00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:48,830
difference as I mentioned I'm a new

00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,600
parent one of the scariest things about

00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:54,530
being a parent is the sad fact that

00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:56,060
childrens sometimes die as parents we

00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,040
don't want to think about it but if we

00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,380
want our kids to grow up healthy we have

00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,540
to be aware of the risks to them we're

00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:06,710
scared but we have to do something about

00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:08,359
it one of the scariest risks to a baby's

00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:11,480
health is the risk of sudden infant

00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:12,230
death syndrome or SIDS this is just what

00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,990
it sounds like

00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,150
sometimes infants suddenly die for no

00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:18,260
apparent reason

00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:22,430
preventing this is obviously of great

00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:24,410
interest to pediatricians there's no

00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:27,619
stem cell therapy miracle drug or

00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:29,510
vaccine to prevent SIDS instead doctors

00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:31,330
use the most effective medical technique

00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,800
at their disposal to save lives

00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:39,140
coming up with a simple checklist and

00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:41,150
relentlessly promoting it in 1992 the

00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,840
American Academy of Pediatrics released

00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:47,480
some safe sleep guidelines in 1994 they

00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,340
decided that it wasn't making enough of

00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,200
a difference to prevent SIDS and they

00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,240
launched a campaign originally called

00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,090
back to sleep

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,220
here's how it works in the hospital

00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,710
after my kid was born every single nurse

00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:03,109
I saw would say in a singsong voice back

01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:04,700
to sleep and quickly rattle off a little

01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:06,859
speech about the importance of always

01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,810
putting my baby on their back to sleep

01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:12,260
on a firm flat surface with no loose

01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:15,530
blankets at the crack of dawn after I've

01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,359
given birth good morning new mom put

01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:19,640
your back to sleep put your baby on

01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:22,910
their back on a flat surface no loose

01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,730
blankets at lunch a nurse came in

01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:27,530
checked me and my baby and said back to

01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:30,070
sleep we're gonna put your baby on their

01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:33,980
back on a flat surface no loose blankets

01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:36,200
in the middle of the night nurse came in

01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:38,750
to check the baby's vitals and said good

01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,950
job back to sleep they're on their back

01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:44,510
on a flat surface

01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:46,580
yada-yada-yada this may seem like too

01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:47,900
much repetition of a basic idea but

01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:50,210
since the guidelines were

01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:53,510
and the campaign started the SIDS rate

01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,370
has dropped by over 50% and note that

01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:58,010
this terrible chalk drawing is actually

01:00:55,370 --> 01:01:03,800
a copy of a graph of a real graph that's

01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:06,050
on the CDC's website that's roughly 2500

01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,940
fewer deaths per year than in 1994

01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,500
because doctors and nurses were not

01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,720
willing to leave it up to chance that

01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,070
parents knew this information or that

01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:17,270
they could even remember it in their

01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:20,030
sleep-deprived state that's at a

01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:23,150
conservative estimate over 30,000 lives

01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:25,070
saved since 1994 in large part due to

01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:27,650
medical professionals coming up with a

01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:30,470
set of easy simple guidelines that

01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,720
parents choose to follow to be clear

01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:35,990
babies still do some died of SIDS and

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,120
other causes every year the back to

01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:39,680
sleep campaign didn't eliminate SIDS

01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,980
and as certainly didn't eliminate

01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:45,260
childhood illness but 30,000 lives saved

01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,580
is still pretty good and well worth the

01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,690
effort

01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:52,829
[Applause]

01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:52,829
[Music]

01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,580
the stakes and software security can be

01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:01,950
pretty high too sometimes surprisingly

01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:04,440
high you might just be working on a

01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:06,240
little open-source tool for fun but one

01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,340
day you could discover that it's used in

01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,880
a safety-critical system like vehicle

01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:13,620
control software or medical software

01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,750
even if your code is not used in devices

01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:18,300
themselves it might be in the systems

01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:21,240
used to manage devices or to deliver

01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:23,340
software updates to them maybe some of

01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,590
the users of your holiday recipe web app

01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:27,480
use the same password to log into the

01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:29,910
industrial control system where they

01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,770
work so passwords stolen from your web

01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,690
app could shut down a whole factory

01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:36,390
because an attacker managed to link a

01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:41,130
user from your web app to the control

01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:43,500
systems where they work just like in the

01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:45,780
previous medical example sometimes these

01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,120
very serious potential consequences can

01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,400
be significantly reduced by making a

01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:53,700
concerted society-wide effort to follow

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,060
a few simple steps cross-site request

01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:59,220
forgery or CSRF has been a known

01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:02,970
vulnerability in web applications since

01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:05,340
2001 an attacker tricks a logged in user

01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:06,900
into performing an action like

01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:09,870
transferring money or changing a

01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:13,350
password on a website without their

01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:16,470
knowledge it's been so prevalent that

01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:19,500
the OWASP top 10 most critical web

01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:26,370
application security risks has included

01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:28,530
CSRF in their list since 2010 the OWASP

01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:30,510
site documents several possible

01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,000
mitigations which can be tricky to

01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:35,250
implement and get right

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,960
luckily web frameworks have decided to

01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:39,180
greatly reduce the burden of knowledge

01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,080
on developers by building in CSRF

01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:44,100
protection enabling it by defaults and

01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,590
extensively documented the feature

01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:50,370
making a checklist a developer has to

01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:52,880
follow much simpler one use a framework

01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:58,910
or library that provides CSRF protection

01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,910
to invoke it very simple

01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:06,690
in 2010 a wasp claims that a web

01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:12,089
application had a 24% probability of

01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:14,190
having a CSRF vulnerability in 2017 CSRF

01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:17,339
fell off the top 10 list entirely and

01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:20,730
only 5% of applications reviewed by them

01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:22,770
had CSRF vulnerabilities a wasp

01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:25,349
specifically credited this to the

01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:28,020
inclusion of CSRF protections in web

01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:30,510
frameworks and the developers making use

01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,820
of them so awesome job framework writers

01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,190
for building in an easy-to-use security

01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,660
feature and good job developers for

01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:39,500
knowing about the feature and not

01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,500
bypassing them

01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:49,769
that's a pretty big reduction in the

01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:52,949
incidence of a vulnerability by simply

01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:55,140
following a basic checklist I'd like to

01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:57,390
see that trend continue and to see more

01:04:55,140 --> 01:05:01,049
vulnerabilities fall off the OWASP and

01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:02,609
other top vulnerability lists similarly

01:05:01,049 --> 01:05:05,069
to the back to sleep campaign though

01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:07,709
even if everyone followed the most

01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:09,779
well-known boring security practices

01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:11,819
some number of applications will still

01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:13,739
get exploited there will always be new

01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:16,619
vulnerabilities to defend against and

01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:19,680
new tools to learn about but we can all

01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:21,869
make our applications safer if not

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,880
perfectly safe by consistently and

01:05:21,869 --> 01:05:28,949
methodically following security

01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:30,749
practices that we already know each of

01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:32,869
my character is represented a different

01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:35,999
developer role but realistically

01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:37,529
developers have multiple roles all of us

01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,430
are responsible for some sort of

01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:41,009
sensitive data

01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:44,039
we probably administer our own machines

01:05:41,009 --> 01:05:46,559
if nothing else we write some code we

01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,420
make sure that that code works we've all

01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,690
helped someone less experienced than us

01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:54,509
or written docs or tutorials in my

01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:56,430
happily ever after every one of us will

01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:58,949
care enough about software security and

01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:01,229
our users privacy that we put some

01:05:58,949 --> 01:06:04,190
effort into learning about and applying

01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:06,479
best practices for our respective roles

01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:09,209
it doesn't have to be a lot of effort

01:06:06,479 --> 01:06:11,670
and it can be as simple as finding and

01:06:09,209 --> 01:06:13,619
following a checklist but it has to be

01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:16,739
continued all throughout our work in

01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:22,140
software we can't just stop at some

01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:24,029
point in my happily ever after we will

01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:26,069
have gotten good enough at propagating

01:06:24,029 --> 01:06:28,410
security knowledge encouraging good

01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:30,630
security practices and our security

01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:32,849
tools have gotten so easy-to-use that

01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:36,209
for most people that effort will be

01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:38,130
minimal and it my happily ever after

01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:40,799
attackers won't be able to make use of

01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:44,640
the same types of exploit for multiple

01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:48,630
decades for instance CSRF or buffer

01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,849
overflow and a my happily ever after the

01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:53,459
security community becomes as accessible

01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:55,469
inclusive and welcoming to all as the

01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:56,849
Python community because if we want

01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,600
everyone to feel as if they are

01:06:56,849 --> 01:07:00,210
responsible

01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,940
for and have a stake in improving the

01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:05,070
security of the software ecosystem then

01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:09,990
they must also feel able and empowered

01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:11,610
to do so thank you very much I hope you

01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:13,800
all enjoy the rest of the conference

01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:17,390
and go forth and make your software and

01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,390
processes more secure

01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:38,200
[Music]

01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:42,060
Thank You thanks all right another round

01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,060
of applause for gangly thank you our

01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:49,690
[Music]

01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:53,320
next keynote for the morning will be Q

01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:55,960
mishegoss camisa is a librarian at the

01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,450
Detroit Public Library specializing in

01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,840
technology and library instruction a

01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:04,450
certified raspberry pie instructor QQ

01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,740
runs the Parkman coders program at the

01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:08,140
Parkman branch of the Detroit Public

01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:10,270
Library focusing on introducing children

01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:19,830
to computational thinking with Python

01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:19,830
so please welcome Q okay

01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:31,059
hi everybody

01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:33,349
mmm good morning hello Cleveland right

01:08:31,059 --> 01:08:34,039
I'm not a rock star so I'll never get to

01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:39,949
say that again

01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:43,039
okay so this is the people in Python so

01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:45,380
let's start with the story once upon a

01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,909
time the Detroit Public Library the

01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,509
Parkman branch which is on the west side

01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:50,929
of Detroit

01:08:47,509 --> 01:08:53,989
there was an unsuspecting library

01:08:50,929 --> 01:08:57,319
employee that was me and there was a ton

01:08:53,989 --> 01:09:00,949
of bored children and my coworker said

01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:03,710
you know what's big right now cue coding

01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:07,489
we should really start a coding program

01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:08,900
for the kids right I was like that's so

01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:11,179
cool you're gonna start this coding

01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,710
program for kids and she's like no

01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:15,500
you're gonna start the coding program

01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:17,929
for kids that's like I don't know how to

01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:21,650
code she's like no it's fine you're

01:09:17,929 --> 01:09:23,929
young you can learn it it'll be fine and

01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:25,849
at the time I was going into archives

01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:30,949
those like yeah that'll be just like

01:09:25,849 --> 01:09:34,039
going into archives so we started out

01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:36,769
using tinker comm for our kids and

01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:38,449
different websites like our code using

01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:41,119
different programs that were scratch s

01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:44,239
building blocks type things and the kids

01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:46,250
had a ton of fun we had 26 kids signed

01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,619
up for the first one and we only won at

01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:51,710
20 or the saw we were expecting anyway

01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:54,590
so it was so popular we ran it again the

01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:56,719
second month I still had a over a crowd

01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:59,000
of kids and then we started to do it

01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,440
during the school year but then our

01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,469
attendance started to trickle down and

01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,639
down and down so I asked the kids why

01:10:03,469 --> 01:10:05,150
don't you want to come and code in class

01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:09,530
anymore

01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:11,000
and the answer that's baby stuff I don't

01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:15,110
want to keep moving these blocks around

01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:19,449
I want to do something real I was like

01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:19,449
oh you're seven and that's baby stuff

01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:30,980
okay so in response to the baby stuff I

01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:32,330
decided to get some raspberry pies so I

01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,170
thought this will be a little bit more

01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:35,570
for them right

01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:37,580
raspberry pies and also at this point

01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,780
when we graduated from baby stuff the

01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:42,590
administration's that are they going to

01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:45,020
be hacking our computers so raspberry

01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:47,330
pies it was and then in true librarian

01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:49,310
fashion I read some books I read a lot

01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:54,700
of books this is one of my favorite ones

01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:57,470
and then I went to PyCon in Montreal I

01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,730
went to PI cons education summit which

01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:01,010
was amazing

01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:03,110
I watched young coders and I got a lot

01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:04,880
of good information and then they were

01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:09,220
like you should go to PI Ohio so I went

01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:13,490
to PI Ohio go to PI Ohio's really great

01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:16,190
so then I was like okay I met some cool

01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:17,870
people at PyCon and PI Ohio I got some

01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:22,910
micro bits I was like really getting

01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:25,700
into this now then Pike Adam e Raspberry

01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:27,380
Pi has a PI Academy where they train you

01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:29,930
how to use raspberry PI's and you become

01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:31,700
a certified raspberry pie educator the

01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:34,730
library paid for me to go there so I was

01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:36,140
in the first quart of people and the

01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:40,120
United States that little arrow there's

01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:43,910
me in the middle and so now I'm a

01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:48,310
certified raspberry pie educator so I

01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:48,310
went through all the steps thank you

01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,650
to prepare myself because these kids

01:11:52,489 --> 01:11:57,110
that I was proposing baby stuff to them

01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:58,940
so I had to get myself to a level where

01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:03,199
I could teach these kids something that

01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:05,510
wasn't baby stuff so so far the library

01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:09,079
I got my certification I read a ton of

01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:10,699
books did some tutorials we've been

01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:13,309
doing all sorts of programs at Parkman

01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:13,760
Branch Library this is from teen tech

01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:15,260
week

01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,460
just a few weeks ago we've been working

01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:22,219
on microbe it's this girl joy programmed

01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:24,679
Galactica reconfiguration she programmed

01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:27,440
the images herself and then coded them

01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:30,849
to music which was really cool my

01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,849
project didn't look anything like that

01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:37,969
we also work with Minecraft pi because

01:12:36,889 --> 01:12:41,480
I'm sure you've heard this a million

01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:44,030
times all kids love minecraft right so

01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:46,489
with the Raspberry Pi we let them play

01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:49,400
Minecraft PI first as an enticement and

01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:53,329
then we introduced Idol which I know

01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:56,750
don't grown right and we let them code

01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:58,610
in their minecraft game and that was so

01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:01,670
exciting especially because you can code

01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:03,500
active flowing lava in Minecraft pi and

01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:06,170
kids are like yes everything is flowing

01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:09,110
lava or yes everything is going to be

01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:12,579
exploding TNT I don't know why they

01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:16,280
never get bored of seeing things explode

01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:18,349
and then we started to do robot cars and

01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:20,710
at this point this is our third session

01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:24,110
of doing parking encoders I found that

01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:28,719
little children were also coming so my

01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:31,460
range was from 6 to 17 kids I had coming

01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:34,010
hard lesson learned about six-year-olds

01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:37,670
they're not ready to learn Python or

01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:39,469
much of anything just yet one came from

01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:41,780
Minecraft pi he wrote two lines of code

01:13:39,469 --> 01:13:44,260
and then he ran down the hall and rolled

01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:48,380
on the floor for the rest of the session

01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:50,599
so that's why I learned probably had to

01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:52,940
separate this so we started doing a

01:13:50,599 --> 01:13:54,949
junior version of our bigger projects so

01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,869
the older kids made robot cars and the

01:13:54,949 --> 01:13:58,699
younger kids got to color paper robots

01:13:56,869 --> 01:14:01,340
and we put the circuits in it so they

01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:03,730
can light it up and that will entertain

01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,730
them

01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:12,670
so that's how Parkman coders got started

01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:15,880
and our most our next project coming up

01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:17,380
is going to be a greenhouse project kids

01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,210
are gonna make time-lapse cameras to

01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:22,240
watch the plants grow and they're gonna

01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:24,780
build water moisture sensors so that's

01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,780
what we're doing next

01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:38,670
one of my most proud and crowning

01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:40,110
achievements for this program is on the

01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,460
right-hand side is a picture from when

01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:43,850
we first started and on the left-hand

01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,139
picture is a picture from this past year

01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:48,780
three of the kids and these pictures are

01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:50,790
in both pictures we have about six kids

01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,739
that have been doing this with me as

01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:54,360
long as I've been doing it so I'm really

01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:56,610
proud of those guys for sticking through

01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,199
it and one day they'll be here or I'll

01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:00,440
be working for them or you'll be working

01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,440
for them

01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:12,650
but on to the issues every silver cloud

01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:16,570
has its lining right we've all got some

01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:20,570
issues for me it was getting materials

01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:22,400
getting a budget kids were in idle

01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:25,219
getting weird crazy error messages and

01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:28,910
freaking out why is it red miscue why

01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:32,660
why why that's like I don't know we're

01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:34,310
just gonna look at it again um alright

01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,680
because it was a beginning program at um

01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:38,000
like this is a part of the process

01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:41,150
failure and error messages are part of

01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,180
learning right so we had a few minor

01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:46,070
issues for our actual program right but

01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:48,469
I also want to talk about a sliding

01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:51,890
scale of issues right so there's issues

01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:54,230
running our program but also there's the

01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:56,030
tech world's issue right and I'm sure

01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:57,980
you've all google diversity and

01:15:56,030 --> 01:16:01,670
technology everybody knows about this

01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:03,680
right how do we get women and minorities

01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:07,190
right where is the diversity

01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,810
why aren't you diverse enough well I'm

01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:10,580
here to tell you that women and

01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:14,210
minorities are not unicorns

01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:18,110
we are magical but it's not a mystery

01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:19,910
what it takes to sustain us okay it's

01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:21,890
the three basic things that it would

01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,600
take sustain any great relationship

01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:25,460
right if you ever had a good

01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:29,210
relationship or a bad relationship you

01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:31,280
know this right respect for a person as

01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:35,780
a human being just acknowledging that

01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:37,730
your person and I'm a person right and

01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:41,330
then here's the tricky part engaging

01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:44,090
that person right saying hi how are you

01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:46,489
ask them a question listen to the answer

01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:50,300
they give you or if they ask you a

01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:54,830
question answer the question right and

01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:56,870
the lar thing value right people don't

01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:59,000
want to stay with a person or a company

01:16:56,870 --> 01:17:01,760
that doesn't make them feel valued

01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,440
I don't feel valued if I make less money

01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,410
then this guy we're here and we do the

01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:08,210
same thing that's not value if you can

01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:11,930
stick to those three things respect

01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:15,790
engage and value you can retain people

01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:15,790
right but we

01:17:21,949 --> 01:17:26,400
however that's a middle issue that's not

01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,770
even the top issue that we're going to

01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,920
talk about today

01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:36,750
other issues my kids issues these are

01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:38,760
the biggest issues to me so poverty the

01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:41,460
kids that come to my program they're

01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:44,219
poor and kids know that they're poor

01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:47,250
okay they struggle with it so if I'm

01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:49,110
teaching kids Python it kind of hurts

01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,130
their process if they really enjoy it

01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:51,900
and they can't go home and do it

01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:54,480
themselves because they can't afford a

01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:56,730
computer or their family can't afford a

01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,100
computer and then I say I'll give you a

01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:00,929
Raspberry Pi and they can't afford to

01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,429
get the things they need to hook up to

01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:05,190
it they can't get a keyboard they can't

01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:07,619
get a mouse great or even worse they

01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:10,139
don't have internet at home these are

01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:12,510
real issues and it's in my book more

01:18:10,139 --> 01:18:14,869
important than why can't you keep mine

01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:19,530
or yes you gotta help them get there

01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:21,659
also illiteracy is the issue so we're

01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:23,489
teaching kids how to program but we also

01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:25,530
have to backtrack and make sure that

01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:28,590
they're reading properly I had a kid

01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:31,170
come to the library just last week he's

01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:33,570
9 he said I want to play robotics I said

01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:35,730
ok he's like can you help me I said ok

01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:38,159
could we go through the computer and he

01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:40,530
said I said click here click here and I

01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,639
said now you're a roblox play find the

01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:42,119
game he's like I don't know what to do

01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:43,440
next

01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:44,850
I was like what do you mean you don't

01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,619
know what to do next like find the game

01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:48,810
you want and click on it and I realized

01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:51,060
he wasn't reading the screen because he

01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:53,909
couldn't read and so he needed to create

01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,179
an account and he said what do I put

01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:56,369
here

01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:58,050
I said well just use your last name and

01:18:56,369 --> 01:19:01,020
something for your username he said I

01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:03,270
don't know how to spell it and that was

01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:04,619
devastating to me and of course when I

01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:06,090
get back I'm gonna work with that kid

01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:07,830
extensively and I've already put the

01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:10,020
children's librarian on him we're gonna

01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:16,290
work on him but these are boundaries to

01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:19,230
them hunger have you've ever been hangry

01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:21,449
at 2:00 or 3:00 in the day you already

01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:23,340
know hunger is know nothing to play with

01:19:21,449 --> 01:19:24,869
right you can be hangry and that'll ruin

01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:28,530
the rest of your day and your co-workers

01:19:24,869 --> 01:19:31,590
day and your family's Day and I've had

01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:33,389
kids come to me and say miss Q can I

01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:34,320
have some snacks to take home with me

01:19:33,389 --> 01:19:37,650
cuz we don't have any food

01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:40,140
at home right and that's heartbreaking

01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:46,260
for me to know that they don't have the

01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:49,070
basic things that they need crime and

01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:52,620
violence is a reality for these kids

01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:54,570
they're used to it unfortunately I had a

01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:58,130
kid come and say miss Q he's like have

01:19:54,570 --> 01:20:00,060
you ever been to jail looks like what

01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:01,650
it's like have you ever been to jail

01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:03,360
what's it what's it like I was like why

01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:06,390
are you asking if I've ever been to jail

01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,130
he said oh my cousin's going to jail he

01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:12,420
broke into an old lady's house so he you

01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:15,260
get some money but that's his world that

01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:18,180
was just a normal conversation for him

01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:21,060
all right there are more pressing issues

01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:25,770
for people than the tech industry trying

01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:28,470
to maintain diversity but with all of

01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:30,960
this those kids have lack of resources

01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:33,960
they face a lot of different adverse

01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,810
situations but those kids are strong

01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:40,040
because of it when you lack resources

01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:44,550
and you face adversity that becomes

01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:47,340
resourcefulness and resiliency right

01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:50,910
those kids are always doing more and

01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:53,910
more and surprising me and that leads to

01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:57,510
innovation right and sometimes for good

01:20:53,910 --> 01:21:00,210
and sometimes not so good we have do

01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:01,560
trade is experiencing a revival now so

01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:05,190
there's all sorts of cool hipster things

01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:07,590
like electric bikes downtown and so I

01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:11,220
found out that in the neighborhood

01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:13,560
around the library kids were stealing

01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:15,750
lawnmowers taking the engines off of

01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,500
them putting them on bikes and making

01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:20,910
their own electric bikes which I was

01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,260
really impressed with I was like holy

01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:24,900
crap I would have never thought to do

01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:28,050
that of course I don't want them to

01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:29,160
still lawnmowers but I my god I can't

01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,990
believe they could put the engine on the

01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:34,490
bike and actually make it work and no

01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:34,490
one's been injured yet so that I hear

01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:41,670
other times we've got kids that exploits

01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:43,770
systems the library allows you to use

01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:46,170
the computer for one hour with your

01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:47,449
library card we had a kid come to the

01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:50,239
library and found out

01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:52,880
you can register for a library card on

01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:55,639
the website and fill in this information

01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,440
and get a library card but you need to

01:21:55,639 --> 01:21:58,940
have a Detroit address we had a kid in

01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,969
the background like why is there a crowd

01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:04,340
back here he had created 20 library

01:22:01,969 --> 01:22:05,840
cards and passed them out to his friends

01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:14,119
so they could play roblox longer

01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:19,789
together these card

01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:21,829
these kids are innovators okay so for me

01:22:19,789 --> 01:22:26,059
this talk is really about opportunity

01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:30,199
right these kids are great they just

01:22:26,059 --> 01:22:33,530
need an opportunity and so for us that's

01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:38,449
my little python man right we're

01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:42,409
teaching them Python because everything

01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:45,619
else is baby stuff but also because it

01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:47,929
gives them exposure right these kids

01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:49,729
live with what they know we want to

01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:52,429
expose them to something more than what

01:22:49,729 --> 01:22:55,099
they know and Python is all over the

01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:58,239
world exposure to Python is exposure to

01:22:55,099 --> 01:23:01,969
the world an opportunity for those kids

01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:04,159
it's empowerment to when you learn how

01:23:01,969 --> 01:23:06,139
to code the first thing we like to do is

01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:08,780
break somebody else's code because

01:23:06,139 --> 01:23:11,239
you're empowered to mess stuff up or to

01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:13,219
make stuff better and it's good for them

01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:14,920
to know that you have the options to do

01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:17,929
more than what someone says you can do

01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,999
right you can use your superpowers for

01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:23,650
good or evil and we let them test it but

01:23:19,999 --> 01:23:23,650
then we encourage them to do good right

01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:31,219
now they're mostly consumers right all

01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,900
the kids go to the same schools they

01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:35,119
come to library they had a homework

01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,070
project the teacher says you have a

01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:40,639
million dollars how are you gonna spend

01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:42,949
it so the teacher mandated that they had

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,840
to go to college so they all had to pick

01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:47,300
a college but then after that

01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:51,229
everybody's projects were the same they

01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:54,590
bought a house a mansion usually a car -

01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:57,670
a house for their mom i phone and

01:23:54,590 --> 01:24:00,800
several new pairs of shoes

01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:03,110
without exception and I want these kids

01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,270
to know that their goals their

01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:08,150
aspirations should not be to own iPhone

01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:09,980
right their aspirations should be to be

01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:12,290
the next iPhone to create a better

01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:14,990
iPhone that they can do that they're not

01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:23,840
just consumers they will be the next

01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:24,890
innovators so it's the point the point

01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,740
is greatness

01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:30,380
these kids have greatness in them they

01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:32,840
just need an opportunity to develop that

01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:36,110
greatness and for you

01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:38,750
don't be selfish cultivate greatness and

01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:40,880
others because no one has ever become
