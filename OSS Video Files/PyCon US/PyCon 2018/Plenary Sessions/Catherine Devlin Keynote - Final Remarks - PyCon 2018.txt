has everybody had a great day at PyCon

00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,950
of the past three days been good

00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:21,480
is anyone staying a little longer

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,410
[Applause]

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,669
[Music]

00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,610
awesome I'm super glad to hear

00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:31,550
we've worked super hard to make this

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,320
happen there are bunches of people that

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,719
we'll talk about later that made that

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,040
possible but first we're going to

00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,790
welcome to the stage

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,210
Katherine Devlin Katherine is a Python

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,010
community addict since PyCon 2004 the

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,890
founding chair of Pi Ohio in Columbus

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,870
Ohio teaches Python intros in a variety

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,480
of informational settings to others and

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,100
sometimes accost strangers on the bus to

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,640
tell them that Guido loves them and has

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,680
a wonderful plan for their computer

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:13,090
without further introduction Catheryn

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:17,469
Devlin oh goodness

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:21,380
oh I'm spoiling myself already okay

00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:22,390
hello PyCon I am so happy to have you

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,800
here

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,970
[Music]

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,970
[Applause]

00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,740
welcome to small data and even though

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,770
you've been here already for three days

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:44,149
or maybe more I can't help but say it

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:47,030
welcome to Ohio I hope you're having a

00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,409
fantastic time I hope that you're that

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,659
many of you are going to be able to stay

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,819
for Sprint's or at least to hang around

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,979
Ohio in general I hope that you're

00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,079
already thinking how can I possibly go

00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:59,479
an entire year before coming back to

00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,239
Ohio for another great community-led

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,179
Python conference well you are in luck

00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,789
because by Ohio happens the last weekend

00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,619
of July the CFP closes on Tuesday we'll

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:12,440
do a little CFP jam during the sprints

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,900
or you can do it on the plane home also

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,060
check for community Python conferences

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,609
around you regional conferences if there

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,230
aren't any look around for your own

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:22,910
personal Eric Flair there are probably

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,230
people who will help you get one going

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,000
it worked for me so yes I live in Dayton

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,280
not far away I did not have to fly this

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,319
was great but it did deprive me of the

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,079
educational opportunity afforded by

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,690
in-flight magazines which would have

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:42,079
taught me great technical information

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:49,609
like data is the new oil and I am really

00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:52,700
jazzed about that I can hardly wait so

00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:55,099
really though all they mean is that the

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,290
field is becoming professionalized big

00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,910
data is a thing data science is a real

00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,769
thing and for the most part that's

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,880
really good

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,859
professionalization means that we're

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,989
getting better techniques better tools

00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:08,720
better standards people are getting paid

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:12,919
for it that's always nice and you know

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,319
salaries are great however when we look

00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,150
at our power to change the world we need

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,690
to ask a question what are we changing

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,030
the world into because who uses big data

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,879
everyone can but for the most part it's

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,220
big institutions do those institutions

00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,049
use it for the public good sometimes yes

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,329
sometimes no but even when they are

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,400
using it for the public good the public

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,440
rarely understands what's being done

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,600
they've heard that big data is a big

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,660
thing but as

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,430
something that have any contact with so

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,190
are we in danger of becoming data

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,160
Janissaries the servants of a ruling

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,470
class are we going to help a dominant

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,430
caste continue to dominate make a

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,080
stratified world even more stratified

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,460
professional can mean good but sometimes

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
professional means the opposite of

00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,140
amateur and amateurs are good because

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,450
amateurs are how the world in general

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,150
stays in contact with what we're doing

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,280
amateurs tear down the curtain that

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,490
separates professionals from everybody

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,630
else without amateurs we have a mystery

00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:20,280
and alienation so do we have any fans of

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,450
hospital food here ok

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,370
hospital food is not generally popular

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,770
and some of that is for objective

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,780
reasons of quality understandably but I

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,540
think objective reasons I think some of

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,580
it is also subjective because if a

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,500
friend cooks you dinner when you're sick

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,630
and brings it over it's the sweetest

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,400
thing in the world it just touches your

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,140
heart but if you're sick and the

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,590
hospital staff cooks dinner and brings

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,980
it to you yeah you don't care and why is

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,530
that well a lot of it is because you're

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,240
at the end of a pipeline you have no

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,130
contact anywhere up the pipeline you

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,110
don't know the people who made it you

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,330
have no contact with them you don't have

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,730
any feedback toward them you're just the

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,930
end of this institutional process and so

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,280
it makes the food taste bad

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,850
we're in some danger of having a

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,910
hospital situation going on with the

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,040
world's data most people know that big

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,240
data is powerful it's mysterious they

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,910
keep hearing about it from all these

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,410
in-flight magazines that it helps to

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,730
control the world but it's something

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,970
they know nothing about

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,430
it's wizardry behind the curtain that's

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,530
a very alienating feeling it makes you

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,830
feel like the world you're living in is

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,870
not your own now I work for one of the

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,820
biggest institutions on earth okay it

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,800
probably is the biggest institution on

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,320
earth I'm a federal employee of the US

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,180
government hello

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,669
specifically I work for 18f a great

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,350
digital agency that helps the rest of

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,510
the federal government get the same

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,129
techniques and technologies into its

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,830
software building and by

00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,989
that all of you know and love we're kind

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,029
of a sister agency to the USD s

00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:00,669
separated at Birth you might say in

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,019
particular 18 F is chock-full of Python

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,849
you should consider doing a tour with us

00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:06,039
it's been the best experience of my

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,779
professional life and I have to

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,580
apologize here to all the non Americans

00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,989
I'm going to give a talk almost as if

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,909
America is the world I hate to do that

00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:15,099
America is not the world but hopefully

00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,839
you can map it mentally to the situation

00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,909
in your country which is probably

00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,610
awfully similar and in fact a lot of you

00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:25,330
have agencies somewhat similar to USD S

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,610
or 18f having said that this is not an

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,259
18 F talk these are my personal views

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,809
they have not been reviewed or approved

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:34,059
by anybody in the US government I am on

00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:37,300
vacation I am on my own dime I have gone

00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:45,729
rogue if my supervisor asks you haven't

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:48,610
seen me I have gotten to work on a lot

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:50,829
of great open data projects in 18f where

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,239
we take data that darn well should be in

00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:54,279
front of the public and we get it

00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:56,169
meaningfully in front of the public such

00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,589
as the Federal Election Commission's

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:02,469
database the FBI's crime data Explorer

00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:04,119
and most recently usaspending.gov if you

00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,009
want to know where your tax dollars are

00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:08,050
going we've got that information for you

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,579
with a decent interface but even better

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,069
than that the part I'm most proud of is

00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,689
that we have a well documented API so

00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,949
you can pull that stuff down and if you

00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,719
want to know about secret service

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,259
spending on golf carts in Florida it's

00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,259
in there

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,000
[Music]

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,620
but open-data can't just be pushed it

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,020
also has to be pulled

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,229
we need people out there to grab it and

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,240
take it and use it or else we won't be

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,250
able to go back to the people allocating

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,080
our budgets and say that yes the public

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,060
cares about this yes the public is going

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,949
to use this that's true for government

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,900
it's even true for businesses publishing

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,970
their data everyone wants to know that

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,800
that circuit is going to be completed

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,500
and that the data is actually going to

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,270
be put to use I'm not here to convince

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,740
you to trust your government I don't

00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,740
think you should trust your government I

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,419
want you to manage your government

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,729
because we're your employees employees

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,740
need your feedback your involvement your

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,200
engagement your oversight your

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,280
management but too many people are

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
disengaged

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,690
from their governments and worse from

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,340
their societies overall they've given up

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,680
on the idea that they can understand

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,340
what's going on and have an impact that

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,250
is a cynicism and an alienation that we

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,320
have to do something about people think

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,860
of cynicism as a defense against being

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,979
manipulated it isn't cautious skepticism

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,229
is a defense but cynicism just knee-jerk

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,660
assuming the worst and being blind to

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,970
evidence is a defense mechanism that

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,450
ironically makes us easier to manipulate

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,270
because cynicism breeds disengagement

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:56,330
despair passivity it divides us it

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,430
neutralizes us it conquers us now there

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,200
are many causes of cynicism and I don't

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,540
mean to say that big data is the only or

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,400
the biggest cause at all in fact there

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,470
are groups specifically fostering

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,580
cynicism to make us easier to manipulate

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:13,339
but I do think that the alienation of

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,580
people due to their unfamiliarity with

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:18,890
the new data based universe is a

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,870
contributor to our growing cynicism and

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,080
so that is the part of the problem that

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,480
we as Python people are best equipped to

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,810
deal with how are we gonna deal with

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,290
that let's talk about chickens

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,910
this is where my eggs come from there's

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,100
a surprising number of backyard chicken

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,650
farmers in this room I've always been

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,540
surprised by the yeah go chicken farmers

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,430
all right

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,140
this is not my backyard but we do buy

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,660
these from a neighborhood backyard firm

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,790
and that little bit of direct personal

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,440
contact with my food supply I could ask

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,440
these chickens names I haven't maybe I

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,210
will next time makes me a little more

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,400
mindful a little more knowledgeable a

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:04,050
little more engaged with my own food

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,930
supply and there's an entire movement

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,300
around small food and local food that

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,430
includes yes backyard chicken farms also

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,529
organic farmers gardeners farmers

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,130
markets community supported agriculture

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,589
all creating small-scale local alternate

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,270
channels to the mainstream

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,740
industrialized commercial food industry

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,720
it's not going to replace that

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,130
industrial food industry but it

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
supplements a little bit of it

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,010
with a little bit of food more

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,230
importantly with a little bit of

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,660
knowledge a little bit of engagement a

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,920
little bit of caring it helps connect

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,870
people to their food supply and

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,060
democratize the food supply just a

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,680
little bit and that little bit does make

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,250
a difference

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:48,390
so imagine behind every farm behind

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:51,300
every home rose full of fresh ripe

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,290
organic sustainably and humanely raised

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,730
lists and dictionaries integers and

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:01,110
decimals imagine a small data movement

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,330
democratizing people's use of data a

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,300
little bit like the small and local food

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,800
movement if people not a majority of

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,350
people by any means but lots of people

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,300
more people than now gain personal

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,700
experience in gathering data and

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,740
processing it even in small and simple

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,959
ways can that make them more

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,850
knowledgeable and more engaged in a

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,680
society that is increasingly data-driven

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,779
I don't know so let's do the experiment

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,850
now I am NOT talking about everybody

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,370
spinning up their own Hadoop cluster and

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,830
pointing scikit-learn at it I am talking

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,589
about basic stuff pulling a little data

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,110
off the web processing it in basic

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,430
Python ways combining it with other data

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,650
from other sources to make something

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,460
more meaningful and then representing it

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,160
out to the world

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,960
stuff that can be possibly done or at

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,560
least started on within a few hours of

00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,390
your hello world who's going to be

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,950
interested in that what we've always got

00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,990
students in schools they're a captive

00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,490
audience and Jessica Mackellar is

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,810
keynote on that I'm gonna refer you back

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,260
to that if you haven't seen it that's

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,839
why God gave us pi video watch it

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,490
there's also groups of people who are

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,050
going to be especially interested even

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,580
more so than the general public although

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,240
of course your seat mate on the bus

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,880
definitely needs to hear about it but

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,080
journalists small businesspeople

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,100
activists and organizers of your local

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,640
groups are going to have a special

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,070
reason to be interested local government

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,020
this guy is my hero your local

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,820
government could use data more and

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,560
better but those employees probably

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,980
don't have the budget or the expertise

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,290
without a little bit of help from you if

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,060
you're tuning out thinking this is an

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,880
education talk you are not allowed to

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,420
tune out everybody here has a role more

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,140
will follow on that later what kind of

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,900
projects can a data amateur really do

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,990
what can a person do without becoming a

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,209
programmer as such just dipping a toe in

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,339
I don't have an exhaustive list I have

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,110
an imagination I'm going to throw out

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,330
some ideas from my own imagination there

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,770
are thousands more imaginations here all

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,380
together I think we can come up with

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,430
some great ideas and the most the one

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:15,390
that jumps out at me screaming is CSV

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:17,310
yeah CSV yeah they say that about

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,500
two-thirds of the species on earth are

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,930
microbes I think that about two-thirds

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,770
of the data on earth is in spreadsheets

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,770
and what is a spreadsheet but a CSV

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,370
generator almost everybody's life is

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,320
touched by spreadsheets yes exactly a

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,120
lot of people sweat away a terrifying

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,820
proportion of their lives clicking and

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,160
copying and pasting and dragging away on

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,399
spreadsheets and yet when you dump it to

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,440
a CSV not only can you easily load it

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,209
into Python but you can see exactly

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,220
what's going on there is no mystery

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:52,860
there you could look it straight in the

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,310
eye and say AHA you are made data and

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,610
this is what I am going to do with you

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,140
there are plenty of other

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,510
packages to deal with spreadsheets but

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,640
what I like about CSV is both the great

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,500
great transparency of it and also it's

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,720
in the standard library so you can get

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,700
somebody hooked on processing data with

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,500
Python before you have to wade into the

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,970
treacherous waters of let's get you set

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,860
up with pip end let's teach you how to

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,510
install third-party packages get them

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:21,970
hooked first then have them deal with

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:24,399
that email most people feel overwhelmed

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,589
by their email it was really the first

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,050
form of information overload and every

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,970
email provider provides advanced search

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,070
provides advanced filters and that's

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,380
great but that is never going to match

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,120
the precision and the power of a script

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,190
that people write themselves for their

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,829
own purposes they can get control of

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,510
their overflowing email inbox that has

00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:47,470
been intimidating them since 1997

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,899
granted I haven't gotten control of my

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,790
inbox but you can teach them to its a

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,870
huge source of personally relevant data

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:58,149
for most people when big data makes the

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,190
news they're often talking about social

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,170
media and that's a big part of people's

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,209
lives so it's easy to get people's

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,720
imagination running on how they could

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,829
process that social media in their lives

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,110
which of my friends share a certain

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,730
interest which of them share an interest

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,180
with each other but don't know each

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,980
other

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,649
whose announced their plans for the

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,660
weekend can I hit her along who's

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:22,660
heading to PI Ohio this summer who's

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,550
actually a bot are there any hours of

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,769
the day when I'm more likely to make

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:34,839
misspellings or threaten foreign

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:36,590
countries I'm only speaking personally

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,279
here

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,870
when do I threaten foreign countries

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,700
Twitter's API incidentally is really not

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,960
very user friendly especially for

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,460
beginners it wants you to authenticate

00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,350
even if you just want to do read-only

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,720
stuff kind of weird

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,970
Kenneth writes has written a new package

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,990
too and if you know Kenneth I can stop

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,290
speaking right there and you're already

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,460
googling it to gather Twitter

00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,839
information without having to

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,630
authenticate much more beginner-friendly

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,250
in fact i plan to shake this down during

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,450
these sprints if you want to take an

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,190
hour or two away from your regular

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,040
sprint i think we can quickly knock off

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,170
a little collector to scrape the pike on

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,820
open spaces hashtag and build a grid for

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,089
next year so you won't all have to crowd

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,500
around that lovely open spaces board

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,500
alright yeah let's do it let's do it

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,890
hopefully that will help for pike on

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,810
next year more importantly it'll help

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,240
you get ready to show this to other

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,130
people

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,110
web scraping is basically getting data

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,210
from sites that were not designed to

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,190
provide computer readable data that were

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,680
only designed with human eyeballs in

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,110
mind and this is important because a lot

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,390
of data is only published this way it's

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,050
tricky but fortunately there are some

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,910
good libraries to help us do it and web

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,650
scraping can be especially important for

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,140
getting the world wide part out of the

00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,450
web for finding local resources because

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,580
your local resources local businesses

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,700
local organizations local governments

00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:04,250
often publish in this human eyeball only

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,230
format on a variety of web pages

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,900
scattered here and there not very

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,429
convenient for people to find you can

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,100
pull this together and make local

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,709
directories local event calories it can

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,110
local event calendars or for that matter

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,640
topical you can help people find this

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,260
information that people threw onto the

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,910
web years ago and they don't know why

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,910
anybody isn't finding it api's I'm

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:31,400
talking now web api's are awesome it's

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:34,070
easy to consume and use data when it's

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,160
provided in web api that is after all

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,500
web why web api is even exist so it's

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,250
ironic that we kind of concealed it

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,020
behind this intimidating acronym api

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,790
sound like something only programmers

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,130
know how to do but it's actually the

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,090
easiest way to get information off the

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,980
web so

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,570
we need to show this to people we need

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,490
to show them how easy it is to pull down

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,190
data from api's and make use of it and

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,140
show them how to find interesting api's

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,080
from governments from social media from

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,630
vendors from all sorts of places there

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,279
are entire open data hubs that we can

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,679
point them to and they can start finding

00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:14,360
data from and as AG of a I have to point

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,890
out data gov actually there are so many

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,510
that we kind of need directories of the

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,820
directories some of the nicest

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,940
directories are it take the form of

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,770
simple curated lists on github you might

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,830
want to web search around for that

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,320
before you start when you point people

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,659
to these curated lists though or the

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,340
less curated ones it's actually best to

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:36,320
give them some more specific directions

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,179
or they can just be overwhelmed by the

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,010
quantity so give them a couple of

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,649
suggestions maybe ask them what they're

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,059
interested in point them that way they

00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:47,000
might just like tune out when they say a

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:50,620
thousand different api's the open data

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,149
census is an especially nice form of a

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,610
directory of api's because this is a

00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:57,679
grid where cities are in rows and

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,260
particular types of data are in columns

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,820
now people can use the census to find

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,860
kinds of data they're interested in if

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,200
it's been filled in but it's volunteer

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,480
driven and volunteers can help fill the

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,419
grid in which is great practice for

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,789
digging into your city's open data and

00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:19,880
it's great exercise for a data hunter

00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:22,070
and finally once they've gotten this

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,929
data and done some again basic Python

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,659
transformations you'll want them to

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,520
present it don't try to make them a full

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:30,890
fledged web developer unless they want

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,649
to go that way I'm thinking static site

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,350
generators are awesome they're easy low

00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:38,899
barrier to entry show them how to slam

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,120
together a markdown or restructure text

00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:43,940
page and put it up on something like

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,190
github pages no fuss there's a great

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,350
website called the new dynamic org which

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,620
is good for information about static

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,649
site generators this may include some

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,480
visualization there are a ton of Python

00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:58,610
visualization libraries it's almost like

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,549
the old days when there are a ton of web

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,500
application platforms I'm gonna point

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,100
out specifically altair vis I just

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,419
discovered

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,950
recently I think it's a very beginner

00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,650
friendly that's where I would go to

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,059
point beginners although there are so

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,419
many of them and a lot of the folks who

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:16,220
made them are in this room good on you

00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:19,150
leaflet is is a great way for prevent

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,020
presenting data in map form incidentally

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,840
fortunately there's a Python wrapper

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,299
around leaflet called folium as an

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,090
example of a project that uses some of

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,559
these techniques in Dayton we have a lot

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,510
of properties that have been surrendered

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,580
to the city for failure to pay taxes and

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,370
you can get them for about twenty-five

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,919
hundred dollars plus some bureaucracy

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,330
however it used to be that in order to

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,190
do this you had to first get a

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,990
spreadsheet take items from the

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,820
spreadsheet cross-check them against a

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,669
separate web see a website from the

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,890
county then look those up and those

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,390
addresses up on a map all before you can

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,700
even start figuring out what's going on

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,710
so we weren't seeing a lot of uptake so

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,299
that wasn't great so code for Dayton

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,510
which is the local Code for America

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,580
Brigade did that work for people we

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,490
grabbed the spreadsheet we consumed it

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,559
as a CSV correlated it against the

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,169
county website and presented it as a

00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,929
leaflet map so that you can use this map

00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:17,210
to find your new home and if any of you

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:19,880
want to carpool from your new home in

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:26,330
Dayton to Pike on 2019 just give me a

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:28,280
ping the Open Knowledge International

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,679
has a set of values stories that can

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,350
also jag jog your imagination most of

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,330
them focus on big data applications or

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,580
at least medium data applications of

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,500
open data but they can at least get your

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,429
imagination going just read through them

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,200
it's very lovely and inspirational and

00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,539
your local Code for America Brigade is

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,090
full not only of people with more ideas

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,980
but also potential volunteers to help

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,419
make it happen some of whom are

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,400
brand-new coders some of whom aren't

00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,659
coders yet but you can help show them

00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,640
how easy it can be

00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,980
and again I'm referring you to a past

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,789
Python keynote in this case Katherine

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,820
braces so I promised you you don't have

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,010
to be a teacher and you don't what can

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,280
you do without being a teacher well to

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,860
begin with um you can teach you don't

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,049
need to have a job role as teacher to

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,659
teach you can teach in all

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:22,659
sorts of informal circumstances one-shot

00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:25,480
workshops at your library through local

00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:29,350
groups to local organizations through

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,720
groups like girl develop it actual

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,239
teachers love guest presenters this year

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,489
I went to a high school and gave them a

00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:39,279
little one shot on how to consume the

00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:48,249
studio ghibli API and get information

00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:49,749
about anime movies it was a blast and

00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:53,109
good on Studio Ghibli incidentally for

00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:55,539
making a very user-friendly API Jada

00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:56,739
carpentry foundation teaches classes

00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,690
that are I think at a little higher

00:22:56,739 --> 00:23:00,580
level but they have a nice curriculum

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,259
you could mine they also have a really

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,529
nice program for training their

00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:07,450
instructors and so they're helping bring

00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:12,279
more people into contact with data

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,899
skills you can write and in fact one of

00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,820
the better books on this subject has

00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:19,119
been written but there's still room for

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,169
more books yes great book and this is

00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,970
also a great foundation for a curriculum

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:27,369
blog still exist and are still a great

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,799
way to publish information if you can

00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:32,019
write it up nicely that other people

00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,350
point to it I'm still finding great blog

00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:37,299
posts that helped me through also

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,600
publications still love articles in fact

00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:42,519
you probably have in your city a

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,200
business publication and even an IT

00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,759
publication that are always hurting for

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,379
articles you can tell sometimes they're

00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,909
publishing some really crummy stuff give

00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:50,200
them something better to publish write

00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:53,320
up something about data handling in

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,019
Python don't love it I'm going to shout

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,120
out Julia Evans wonderful UNIX cartoons

00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:02,300
yes yes

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,300
[Applause]

00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:06,460
hers are not about data handling

00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,039
specifically they're about Unix but they

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,379
should inspire you about how effective

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,899
communication can be when it's kept

00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:15,700
informal and very fun so don't get

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:17,229
writer's block thinking that you're

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,419
writing some kind of doctoral

00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:21,399
dissertation and it has to be formal and

00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,710
impressive people don't read doctoral

00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:29,109
dissertations people read cartoons like

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:31,389
this you can speak you can speak here if

00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,399
you want but here you're only preaching

00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:35,950
to the choir there are all sorts of

00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,019
places where non programmers could hear

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,869
from you about how easy it can be to

00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,859
start manipulating their data

00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:44,649
professional groups business groups

00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:46,539
activist groups all of them are out

00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:50,499
there and frankly most of them love to

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:52,479
hear from new speakers you can single

00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:55,029
boost with an awful lot of programming

00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:56,799
problems half of the battle is finding

00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:58,929
the right package to use and the other

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,549
half is finding the right examples and

00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:02,259
tutorials to help you use that right

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:05,710
package so when you find something

00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:08,139
that's cool tell people in person blog

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,940
about it tweet about it you're boosting

00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:14,229
the signal you're helping others find it

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,940
you're lowering the barriers so far I've

00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:17,679
mostly been talking about increasing

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,379
people's skills but it's even more

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:25,419
important to reduce what is demanded of

00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:27,249
people and the first thing wait.you you

00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:29,559
can make things easier on people is just

00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:32,109
by opening up more data wherever you

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:34,239
work wherever you volunteer wherever you

00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:37,179
live and wherever you vote have they

00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:39,279
opened up all their data you can be an

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:41,499
informed voice explaining to them the

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,359
advantages and the benefits of open data

00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:48,369
so please lend your voice you can take

00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,119
the code that we use to analyze data and

00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:54,070
make it easier improve the API or make

00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,429
new wrapper packages with a simplified

00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:00,070
API or make packages that wrap multiple

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:02,919
other packages and ease the work of

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,499
combining them together many packages

00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,200
are built with api's that fit to the

00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:09,700
brains of the fantastic geniuses who

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,799
wrote them and who don't mind the

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,580
complexity but it's so much better when

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,070
the API fits the brain

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,480
of a beginner who's only guessing about

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:23,210
how to use it so find a newbie or be a

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,370
newbie keep track of their uninformed

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,170
guesses about how things maybe work and

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:31,040
then see if you can make those wishes

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,170
come true you can write the docs and yes

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,080
that is the name of a conference you can

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,760
join Prada you can join projects and

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,560
write documentation for them and you

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,070
will be the most popular person there or

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,290
just file documentation PRS every time

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,730
you hit something that confuses you see

00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,280
if you can make a PR out of it to

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,740
clarify the documentation if you could

00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,840
write up good examples about how to use

00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,540
a package that can be some of the best

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,980
documentation possible write it up see

00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,410
if the project wants to incorporate it

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,970
into the main documentation if not blog

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,120
about it and have your friends point to

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,980
it you can answer questions sometimes a

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,140
well-written Stack Overflow answer

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,270
thanks to the magic of web searching can

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,630
be some of the most read documentation

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:18,860
of a project all of this is helping

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:22,160
people ignorant is precious never waste

00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,350
it when you understand how to use a

00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,590
package you don't remember anymore what

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:30,380
it was like not to understand so while

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:32,210
your ignorance is fresh take notes take

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,610
notes of your guesses take notes of your

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:37,130
assumptions as you stumble your way

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:40,040
through take notes of what you stumble

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,450
on of what confuses you and then when

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,270
you make it to the glorious promised

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,440
land of understanding go back and see

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,300
what improvements you can make to this

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,490
API see what improvements you can make

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,470
to the documentation and if it's too

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,960
late if you foolishly wasted your

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,120
ignorance then find a newbie and help

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,930
them through and take notes as they

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,260
stumble and help the next newbie have a

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:05,390
better API and better documentation so

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,220
we've talked about how to increase

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,650
people skills and how to make the code

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,720
easier to use there's a third aspect you

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,760
can make the data itself easier to use

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,910
and I want to shout out the data

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,550
packages project which lets you wrap

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,100
data and meditate it together into a

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,200
format that other tools can use to make

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,049
getting and downloading and importing

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,480
data easier to use it's not very well

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:31,039
yet it really deserves to be so Sigma

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,139
boost for it there's also a start-up

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,179
here at Python app icon called quilt

00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:38,659
that doesn't rather similar things look

00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:41,119
up quilt also again so much data that is

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:43,399
technically available is actually

00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,619
difficult to use availability is really

00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,489
not a boolean so it's more of a float so

00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:51,200
you can bump up the value of that float

00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:52,940
now you should probably be asking

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,779
whether I'm trying to sell you a

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:59,419
Honeywell kitchen mini computer that is

00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:01,909
am I trying to give you a very technical

00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:04,149
gee-whiz computing answer to a problem

00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:07,460
that is not a computing problem and

00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:09,499
largely you're right most of the problem

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,450
of an alienated society has nothing to

00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,710
do with computers nothing to do with

00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,960
data we can't help it

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,629
but I think a significant fraction comes

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,639
from this big data alienation and so we

00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:21,889
can take on a significant fraction of

00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:24,200
the problem how are we going to do it

00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:28,700
what specifically are we going to try to

00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,679
achieve with a small data movement the

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,259
first thing I think we can do is improve

00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,299
civic engagement because when you go to

00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:38,029
your city looking for data you're

00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:40,039
engaging when you nag them for data they

00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:42,230
haven't released yet you're engaging

00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:44,269
when you involve your neighbors saying

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,220
hey look at this data I found less and

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,919
analyze it together when you point them

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,590
to the results that you got when you

00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,809
press for change based on the results

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,909
that you got out of this data you are

00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,649
involved with your city you're building

00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:00,529
a sense of ownership and habits of

00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:03,879
participation among in yourself and

00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:07,220
among everybody who is touched by it

00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:09,200
ethics in data science is a big topic

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,970
all to itself and data scientists are

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,649
discussing it among themselves but they

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,749
shouldn't just be discussing it among

00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,759
themselves the more people have

00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:18,529
experienced in working with data and

00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,749
with all the approximations and

00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,059
compromises that inevitably go into

00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:24,679
compiling data the more people will be

00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:26,960
able to contribute their own voices to

00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,239
that conversation a diversity of voices

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,190
and that will improve the big data

00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:36,769
ethics conversations in the future will

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,770
be will create smarter data consumers

00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:41,290
just like with the eggs

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,180
even when I'm buying store-bought eggs I

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,400
know a little more and I think a little

00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,630
more about those eggs because I've had

00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,120
some personal contact with them

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:52,180
something similar can happen with data

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,890
handling once people have even stripped

00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,490
a single spreadsheet and ripped that

00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,320
data out

00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,530
they're thinking a little bit more about

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,560
the data that's fed to them we can

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:05,350
create demand for open data as I said

00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,200
before open data producers need open

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:11,110
data users and by the way when you use

00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,700
open data it's a great practice to tell

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,260
the people who produced it give them

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,050
some feedback give them some applause

00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,600
that becomes useful for them when they

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,940
have to turn around and justify their

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,060
effort in continuing to open data and to

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,160
open more data I know at 18f every time

00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,540
we hear of people using data that we

00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,950
have helped to open there's a little

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:34,480
party we love that news as we make using

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,520
open data more of the norm and

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,770
publishing open data more of the norm

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,480
we're going to create an expectation if

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,740
you found a can of food in the

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
supermarket that did not have an

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,460
ingredients list you wouldn't buy it

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,590
even if you had no interest in reading

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,480
the ingredients they would be violating

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,720
a norm you feel entitled to that

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,060
ingredient data I want to create that

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,700
kind of sense of entitlement for data

00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:01,630
across all sorts of fields everywhere

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:04,750
possible and I think we can strengthen

00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:07,240
local institutions near exclusive access

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,060
to data handling skills has been one of

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,220
the advantages that big and national and

00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:15,220
global institutions both businesses and

00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,140
non businesses have over local ones so

00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,120
breaking up that monopoly and bringing

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,730
some of these skills to your local

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,550
institutions businesses theater troupes

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:28,810
bowling leagues garage bands can help

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:30,520
level out that playing field all right

00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,200
all right well I bet you're complaining

00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,770
that this is all well and good but you

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,330
haven't seen any cute pet pictures and

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,150
here's the saying chickens don't count

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,920
okay fine you mammal ist's have it your

00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:47,190
way

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,190
this is Kimber yeah okay

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,180
Kimber's people are friends with Josh

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,130
Cory Josh Cory is a brand-new Python

00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,230
ISTA learning Python with the date and

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,720
dynamic languages group we have a weekly

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:02,120
PI Fri hangout

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,460
alas Kimber has food allergies a ton of

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,710
food allergies imagine going through the

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,140
pet store reading that long fine print

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,940
on every dog food bag checking for any

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,210
appearances of any of these foods

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,180
horrible so Josh comes to his friends

00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:19,660
rescue josh says hey I'm learning Python

00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:23,060
and that looks like a data problem and

00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,430
Josh jumps on in he actually found that

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,160
the pet smart webpage has ingredient

00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,110
data so he scraped it and extracted

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,730
ingredients lists and compared it to

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,730
Kimber's lists of allergies and

00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,710
generated a list of safe brands so that

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,930
Kimber's stomach could live happily ever

00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,670
after

00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:44,859
there we go

00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,859
[Music]

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:52,790
we can help nucleate many many many more

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,370
happy Kimber stories just like this so

00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,550
go forth bring the people to the data

00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,130
and the data to the people I hope you've

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:03,020
had a fantastic PyCon I hope that you're

00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,330
going a lot of you can stay for sprints

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,760
have safe travels or safe sprinting I

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,960
will see you back right here next year

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,840
thank you so much

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,909
[Applause]

00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:19,789
[Music]

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:19,789
[Applause]

00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,260
all right another round of applause for

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:40,079
Katherine

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:40,079
[Applause]

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:49,700
we'll see oh there we go so I have bad

00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:55,460
news which is that for many of you this

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:56,960
is the end of Pike on 2018 most folks

00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,030
will not be staying around for Sprint's

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,880
and if you are we'll talk about that

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,390
shortly but before we do I just want to

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,720
thank everyone who is here it means so

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,400
much that you know we all come together

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,600
in this way and then we learn and we

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,070
share and also it just means a lot to me

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,820
personally so I wanted to say thank you

00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:21,230
for being here this year you may have

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,160
noticed yesterday and I forgot to

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:27,650
mention it the city of Cleveland turned

00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,100
blue and gold last night and it was

00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,100
pretty cool

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,269
so so again just thank you for being

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:45,549
here from the bottom of my heart and

00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:50,499
from all the people involved in putting

00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:52,539
PyCon together some notes tonight at

00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:55,920
6:30 at the Great Lakes Science Center

00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:59,380
is the closing dinner for Pike on 2018

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,299
if you have a ticket take it with you if

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,470
you don't intend to use your ticket you

00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:03,910
might want to find somebody who might

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,259
want to use it the food's already been

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,950
allocated and we don't want to see it go

00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:10,539
to waste for introductions to the next

00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,299
four days of Pike on which are this

00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:16,749

begin shortly so these are the pitches

00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:24,249
from folks who will be sprinting over

00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:26,319
the next four days for their project if

00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:29,079

this Convention Center rooms will be

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,739

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,829
world to collaborate on their projects

00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:10,059
we call those sprints here and coffee

00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:12,369
and lunch will be provided last night

00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,349
the pie lady's charity auction was held

00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:16,569
in the Hope Ballroom of the Hilton over

00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:19,599
there and we just wanted to do some

00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:23,759
number stuff so in 2016 the pie lady's

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,440
auction raised $16,000 for the cause in

00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:28,210
2017 it raised twenty one thousand two

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,720
hundred and seventy five dollars for the

00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:33,339
cause and this year in 2018 it raised an

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,150
astounding twenty six thousand one

00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:36,150
hundred dollars

00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:49,190
but wait there's more the Python

00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,020
Software Foundation did not see fit to

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,560
have such a bizarre number dangling

00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:56,560
around and decided to round up to

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,560
$30,000

00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,370
so thank you to everyone who

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,460
participated and consider participating

00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:12,880
next year making a donation or coming

00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:19,090
and just throwing money at guitars and

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:23,590
things so this again is the closing of

00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:25,840
Pike on 2018 and pike on 2019 is a

00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:31,300
little less than a year away it will be

00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:34,479
held in Cleveland Ohio again on May yeah

00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,479

earlier in May oh by the way that's here

00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:51,700
a little earlier in May so even more

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:54,460
unpredictable weather is plausible but

00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:58,060
that's a little ways away in between now

00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,420
and pike on 2019 back here in Cleveland

00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,030

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,650
there are numerous events occurring in

00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,040
our in our community and in our space

00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:12,250
I'm just gonna read them off I have

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:12,610
pages and pages so dinners it's 6:30 no

00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,190
I

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,950

Canada and Pike on Colorado a new

00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:50,020
conference next year so that's a lot of

00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:53,680
numbers or a lot of names if you if you

00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,720
are a Python conference organizer I want

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,390
to I don't have a link but if you come

00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,090
find me or you have a good at Google you

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:04,140
can google on github.com for the Python

00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:06,640
organizers organization and there's a

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,340
conferences great repository there

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,110
that's where I got the list of

00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,330
conferences here and we're considering

00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,790
some interesting things we can do so if

00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,010
you organize a conference

00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,690
and you haven't heard of that Ref that

00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,740
that repository I'd recommend that you

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:26,470
add your conference there but generally

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,120
our conference or our community is

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,500
composed of these conferences and it's a

00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,980
time for us to come together and meet

00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:35,920
and there are so many people who I wish

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,200
were here and for a myriad of reasons

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,020
it's not possible that you that everyone

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,870
come to PyCon every year and so joining

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:47,020
these regional and an other country

00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,490
based conferences is a crucial part of

00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,160
our community and growing it and making

00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,320
it accessible to others so perhaps

00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,180
consider organizing a conference or

00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,910
attending a conference that's closer to

00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:01,890
you it really makes our community

00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,890
possible that we have a network that way

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:24,690
[Applause]

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:32,340
okay I got this with my mother my a very

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:35,340
gasps emotional self and so thanks this

00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:41,010
is an immense undertaking and it's done

00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:46,440
by hundreds of people over the course of

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:50,010
many months and occasionally people step

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,560
forward in a distinguished fashion this

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:57,390
year we had someone who was so kind

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,520
giving that they forfeited something

00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,850
that was offered to them for another in

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,130
order to make this conference possible

00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:08,850
so this year I want to I want to make

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:12,030
clear a I want to make distinguished a

00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:14,240
single volunteer Eric ma Eric are you

00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,240
here

00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:33,390
if you see Eric say thank you and we

00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,440
have something for Eric and we'll

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:40,530
provide it to him later it's just a

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:42,600
piece of paper right but I it was just

00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:45,150
it's just a significant contribution to

00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,880
making this conference hat possible but

00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,530
it's not just one person it is these are

00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,200
actually the pages and pages of people I

00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:54,630
had to think so I'd like to give a round
