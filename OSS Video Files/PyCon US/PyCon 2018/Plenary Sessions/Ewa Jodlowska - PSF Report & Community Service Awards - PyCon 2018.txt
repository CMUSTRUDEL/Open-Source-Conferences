hello my name is Alaska and I am the

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,810
director of operations at the Python

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:14,250
Software Foundation which also noticed

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:16,859
that during this time I would usually

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,980
give you all a few updates on what the

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,650
PSF is doing even though the impact of

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,990
the PSF is important to talk about and I

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,580
will mention it indirectly today I want

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,070
to talk about something a little bit

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,160
different I want to talk about the

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,020
impact all of you have you might be

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,870
sitting there thinking of some impact

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,460
you've had on a person you work with

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,430
someone you're teaching or even

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,780
mentoring here at PyCon or you might be

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,219
thinking of some impact you've had on

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,989
your community or even your home life

00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:51,270
even those even though those are great

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,420
contributions today I want to talk about

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,719
about the impacts you all have by

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,809
participating in PyCon and what does

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,030
that mean that means that even by

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,030
purchasing a registration ticket you are

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,040
making an impact that means that even

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,280
the company that sponsored you to attend

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,530
Python is making an impact that means

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,880
the organization's that you all saw in

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,240
the exhibit hall for the last few days

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,159
are making an impact that means the PSF

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,409
staff and the Python volunteers

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,799
sitting in this room are all making an

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,680
impact that impact is on the global

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,280
Python community and that impact is

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,280
changing lives

00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:43,100
most importantly that impact is on

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,680
people this year in between all of the

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,570
conference talks I place photos for

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,840
various events that the PSF has

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:54,110
sponsored I wanted everyone here to see

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,240
the people we are impacting that impact

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,640
is someone for the first time being able

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,440
to attend a django girl's workshop or pi

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,970
lady's workshop or even their first

00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:08,179
Python conference that impact is showing

00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,410
a child a Raspberry Pi micro bit or even

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,030
a Gemma board for the very first time

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,470
let us take a moment to fully grasp that

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,150
because in current times there's

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:31,790
prolific impact and something we should

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:37,100
all be proud of and why am I talking

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:39,650
about this today several reasons one

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,989
reason is to make sure everyone here

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:47,180
knows the connection between PyCon and

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:48,910
the Python Software Foundation sorry I'm

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,600
just in a few minutes but there we go

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:57,079
the PSF runs Python and in turn PyCon

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,480
helps run the PSF by that I mean the

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,350
revenue generated by PyCon allows the

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,410
PSF to support our community worldwide

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,970
here we see the overview of the PSFS

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,989
2017 financials where green shows our

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,060
revenue and red denotes or expenses the

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,459
PSF will always have necessary spending

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,730
such as overhead costs and the cost that

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,410
it takes to put on Python but because we

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,690
have a little bit of a surplus from

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,450
Python and contributions each year we

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,880
can have impactful expenses as well such

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,440
as the PSFS Grants Program and pythons

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,739
financial aid program if that surplus

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,500
decreases that those impactful expenses

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,269
will decrease as well we of course work

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,540
very hard every year to ensure that

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,970
Python returns a profit the main thing

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,470
to note here is that the first two lines

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,020
you see are for python

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,320
the majority of the PSFS revenue comes

00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:00,480
from PyCon it's actually almost 80% of

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,720
our revenue that 80% is what make that

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,970
80% makes all of the financial aid

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,480
conference workshop and training support

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,550
possible that revenue is the reason why

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,830
we can employ two full-time employees

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,019
some part-time employees and hopefully

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:20,610
grow our team in the near future because

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,740
the demand is there another reason for

00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,450
this topic is so I can emphasize the

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,360
importance of the donation drive that

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,070
the PSF just wrapped up yesterday many

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,170
folks didn't know if they should

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,820
contribute and if they did contribute

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,460
they didn't know what their money was

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,190
going for I am bringing this up so next

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,220
time you see a PSF donation drive you

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,450
know what that impact can have I am

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,780
bringing this up to let you know that

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:48,810
the 22,000 dollars raised can help

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,360
support on average 11 Python conferences

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,500
all over the world which can impact over

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,050
3,000 people that 22,000 dollars can

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,050
help support approximately 27 hands-on

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:05,400
workshops worldwide which can impact 700

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,650
people furthermore community members

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,040
raised important questions about Pike on

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,950
speaker support the first part of the

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,800
speaker discussion what involve the

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,490
process a Python speaker had to take in

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,010
order to get financial support prior to

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,960
2018 speakers had to apply for financial

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,750
aid by filling out a forum just like

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,400
other applicants since our community

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,090
voices are concerned about the process

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,740
we have worked on making it simpler in

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,990
2018 we introduced the speaker grant

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,640
which allows speakers to check a box

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,040
like the one here you see on the screen

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,610
when they fill out their speaker profile

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,410
if a speaker box if a speaker has his

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,419
box selected and they're selected to

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,740
give a talk then we follow up to gather

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,419
more details from them for the second

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,340
portion of the speaker discussion our

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,770
community wanted to know why we didn't

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,289
provide registration transportation

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,700
lodging to all of our speakers by

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,430
default like other conferences

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,410
you for this year alone that reason is

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,210
approximately $140,000 that hundred

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,010
forty thousand dollars that would have

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,930
been spent on pike on speakers can

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,940
support all of the grants we gave out to

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,770
Africa Asia and South America in 2017

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,720
that hundred forty thousand dollars is

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,400
almost the entire financial aid budget

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,190
and speaker grant budget that we

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,230
allotted for this year if we can reduce

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,180
the spending on speakers who can have

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,520
their companies pay for them or even can

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,350
afford to pay for themselves we will and

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,220
it's because of that impact that that

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,200
money can have therefore we give speaker

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,510
support to anyone that needs it to

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,700
attend this conference we hope that by

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,890
making the process easier for speakers

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,860
to get financial support we can ease the

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,440
concerns of how PyCon supports its

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,550
speakers and still maintain our grants

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,040
programs ensure most of this is a high

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,650
overview of what the PSF does and how

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,420
our money is spent but I do hope I have

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,250
made some connections for you and have

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,690
helped you understand the role of the

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:15,060
PSF in the Python ecosystem all right

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,680
now on a lighter note let us take some

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,660
time to thank some people that have

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:25,820
helped to make this community better let

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,820
us walk on Ned bachelor to a stage
