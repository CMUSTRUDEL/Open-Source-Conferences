00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:17,910
oh whoa can you hear me hey you can hear

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:21,539
me hey welcome how y'all doing god I am

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,600
blinded good first day of the conference

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,760
yeah thank you

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,030
I'm Lynn root I'm your lightning talk

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,110
chair Harry is joining me I'm gonna wave

00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,430
he's gonna give you he's much more

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,559
funnier than I am so if you come

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,989
tomorrow he'll be a you'll be in for a

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,149
treat so we're gonna dive right in I

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,640
want the first lightning talk of the day

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,550
Katie Cunningham telling me that I need

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,090
a hobby or you need a hobby something

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,110
like that

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,110
welcome Katie

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,430
[Music]

00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,649
so hi everyone I am Katie Cunningham and

00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,559
I'm going to tell you why you need a

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:07,570
hobby as soon as I get my mouse figured

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:11,210
out there we go okay got it

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,009
so I talked to new Deb's quite a bit and

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,130
one of the pieces of advice I give them

00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:18,350
is to get a hobby because one of the

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,840
things we do in tech is that we tend to

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,610
especially when we're just starting out

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,280
code all the time we go to work we code

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,990
we go home we code on side projects all

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,899
of our socialization happens at

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,490
conferences and meetups and we just

00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:35,690
never get away from it and we are

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,420
consumed by it and I tell them that they

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,500
need to get a non-technical hobby they

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,610
need to get something that does not

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,259
involve computers so why you know if we

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,520
love coding so much we should love doing

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,429
it all the time and it should be our

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,530
passion man well the first thing is you

00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:54,320
need to give your brain a break because

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,920
thinking the same thinking of the same

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,310
way all the time it tends to be a great

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,140
way to lead to burnout it's a real

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,420
threat when you let tech consume your

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,220
life and it is actually hit a lot of us

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,610
that are now entering in our 30s and 40s

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,260
young ends that I've watched many my

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,810
friends start to fall over from burnout

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,280
because they spent their 20s just

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,040
barreling through and you don't want to

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,130
do that it also allows your brain to

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,500
grow in different directions because all

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,540
hobbies require research they require

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,730
thinking they allow you to discover

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,970
things that are different than what you

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,040
would discover in your day to day job it

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,200
could also help your career honestly so

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,170
what am i confessions I in my spare time

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,299
write this ROM pea fantasy fiction stuff

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,250
but that actually helps me hone my

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,870
communication skills because if I want

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,680
to explain what the dragon looks like

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,150
and how the orc died horribly I have to

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,220
do it clearly and that also helps with

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:58,280
documentation and writing emails to my

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:59,930
CEO that are sternly worded also so what

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,060
if it doesn't help your career you know

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,250
not everything has to help your career

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,470
not everything needs to benefit your job

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,880
because companies can always get another

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,190
developer

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,160
but you can't get another you so you

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,320
should take care of you

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,030
you also need more than one tribe we

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,130
tend to socialize within text we only

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,470
ever talk to other tech people but

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,690
knowing people who aren't technical is

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,410
really a good thing it gives you a

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,660
completely different perspective also

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,180
eventually all of us leave Tech one way

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,050
or another some of us change careers

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,550
some of us retire and sad truth is you

00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,350
will lose your friends when you leave

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,940
because we're gonna keep on going to

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,500
conferences and going to meetups and

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,810
it'll be less and less relevant to your

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,890
life so it's good to have another tribe

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,260
to go to to hang out with so what should

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,350
you do what hobbies should you get well

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm biased but I like the fiber arts I

00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,110
like making things I knit I sew I

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,080
embroider you'll actually be able to buy

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,470
some of these things at the auction just

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:10,310
a heads up but I like doing this and

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:13,160
it's not technical writing and vlogging

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,570
are also cheap if not free because you

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,489
can find most of this software for

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,290
absolute free and it doesn't cost me

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:23,480
anything to put words on paper

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:25,520
except for maybe ink also I've been told

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,030
you can go outside and there are things

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,700
to do there I don't know I'm allergic to

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,340
the outside so you know talk to people

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,840
who like have really nice like hiking

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:41,210
shoes around here because the truth is

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,190
the code will always be there on Monday

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,630
so you should go and do something else

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:52,130
with your life on the weekend thank you

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:53,789
[Applause]

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,639
Thank You Katie

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:58,740
I specifically chose the Hilton so I

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,449
could void the outside coming here

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,060
that's okay um next up we have Lukasz

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:09,300
longa I'm speaking about black the

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,560
uncompromising code for matter hello

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,050
everybody Feb 8 is great it's awesome

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,430
among the many things it says it says a

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,860
style guide is about consistency

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,349
consistency with this style guide is

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,599
important but consistency with your

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:27,030
project is even more important well a

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:30,150
foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,490
little minds and pep eight itself has a

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,770
lot of contradicting advice on how to

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,590
rap lines and how to format stuff and

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,319
whatnot so it's more of a framework for

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,090
creating code Styles than a single code

00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,639
style because a code style is an

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,520
agreement between a group of people on a

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,349
team and one of widows keys he insights

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,659
was that code is read much more often

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,419
than written so that includes code

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:56,159
review code style should accelerate code

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,080
review not slow it down it should

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:00,479
decrease round trips between the author

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,310
and the reviewer it should remove noise

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,930
so the reviewer can focus on whether

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,780
there's bugs or missing things or

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,789
whether we want the feature anyway this

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,380
should be as small as possible so that

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,150
the reviewer is not distracted by

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,699
changes which have no semantic meaning

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,409
this sense are good enough formatting

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,229
style is better than having a lots of

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,300
different formats there's a four

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,159
fundamental components to a code style

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,289
let's go through them now and by doing

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:27,240
so introduce you to a subset of web

00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,969
eight that a few people and I developed

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,270
we call it a black code style because

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:36,270
it's any color you like as long as it's

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,039
yes horizontal whitespace well when to

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,900
put spaces when to avoid them the what

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,389
web eight tells you easy

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,460
vertical whitespace what tokens always

00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,500
to brake lines on what tokens never to

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,159
brake lines on and how many empty lines

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,099
to use again do what pep ade says but

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:55,500
when you have bracket pairs always put

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,719
an empty line after the last element and

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,250
didn't it that's also because you

00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:59,909
already do this for dictionaries lists

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,430
and whatnot

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,540
now we can also do this for if

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,700
statements

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,620
and function signatures do whatever that

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,560
way you delimit the function signature

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,840
from the body the if test from the body

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,290
of this statement that's uniform that's

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,660
great

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:20,430
line length cool which one should we

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:24,270
choose 80 or 120 neither if you read

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,600
Raymond's Ettinger Beyond pep eight talk

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,340
he talks about nine years Raymond had

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,140
injures one of the most experienced

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,750
Python developers out there he's a co

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,060
developer for over a decade he's a

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,370
teacher and he has a consultant seen

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,110
tens of millions lines of Python code so

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,990
when he says nine years I believe him

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,280
and I have no reason not to do like if

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,930
you create a class in that class you

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,730
have a method in that method you have

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,440
our context manager and then you have an

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,320
if statement you already lost four

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,780
levels of indentation so 84-79

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,240
as web eight actually says is a little

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,040
too little consistency it's nice if

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,260
you're consistent if we for example use

00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,640
trailing commas everywhere unless it

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,860
fits in one line then we remove

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,740
unnecessary training comments we also

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,360
standardize on double quotes because now

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,220
you didn't never you'll never know if

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,740
this is an empty string or a single

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,210
double quote so we standardize on double

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,290
quotes we standardize on lower-level

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:21,360
strings cool it anticipates apostrophes

00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,880
you're gonna use them so why not you

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
know start with that you're writing doc

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,410
strings right so pep 257 actually tells

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,450
you to use double strings so again

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,610
double strings we interact a lot with

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,020
see because it's Python again double

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,720
strings so this is what you should be

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,240
using so that's sort of the gist of the

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,490
black coding style how do you enforce it

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,670
you install a tool because it's also an

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,240
order formatter and then you can forget

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,010
about it right it is not really

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,380
configurable it requires Python three

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,360
six but you can still format Python 2

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,830
code with it it reformats entire files

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,750
in place it already has a lot of

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,240
integrations with editors so if you use

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,670
any editor you are probably fine so

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,240
what's the status of the tool let me

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,110
share my road map with you so no not

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,110
this one sorry um

00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:16,670
well so the actual Roma is this alpha

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:19,910
beta stable and we are somewhere here I

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,639
actually plan to release the beta in at

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,829
the sprints what that means is that

00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,839
we're gonna have a stable formatting I'm

00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:29,029
not gonna change how I format stuff

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,889
under you anymore and I will likely have

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,839
bugs but that's it the project is

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,850
already pretty popular please help me

00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,319
get to 2,000 stores like at this

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,769
conference I think we can do it together

00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:42,560
like why not it's actually already also

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,660
released where I work at Facebook it

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,009
seemed like you know very good feedback

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,110
oh not exactly uniform but try it out

00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,939
then you can actually decide whether

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,790
you're this one guy or all the other

00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:57,920
people so my name is mukesh lanka I

00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,470
wrote black please use it thank you very

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,600
much

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:07,300
[Applause]

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,830
all right thank you so much next up we

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,430
have sage sharp speaking about

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,770
outreaching hello so I'm talking about

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,590
outreach II which is an internship

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,480
program it's a three-month internship

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,580
program and it's completely remote

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,290
anyone from around the world who meets

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,920
our eligibility criteria can participate

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:29,770
and you get a five thousand five hundred

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,840
dollar stipend and also interns who

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,360
participate in outreach II get a five

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,690
hundred dollar travel stipend to go to a

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,920
conference or event that is relevant to

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:44,380
their project like PyCon for instance

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,410
outreach II is open internationally to

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,870
women both sis and trans trans men and

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,810
genderqueer folks and in the u.s. it's

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,660
also open to people of any gender who

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:58,630
are black african-american Hispanic

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,290
Latino American Indian Alaskan native

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:05,530
Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,930
the goal of outreach e is to connect

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:11,530
these people with open source projects

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:14,260
we run twice a year there's a six-week

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,210
application period where the applicants

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,070
come and they make contributions to

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,800
projects that are listed on the outreach

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:25,780
website so they may have a bug or a

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,350
documentation change in your project and

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,940
they may actually try to contribute that

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,500
upstream so you as a mentor get to see

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,350
how these applicants work in your

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,840
project and the applicants get to see is

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,810
this project interesting do I have the

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,840
skills for it do I like the mentor it's

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:49,360
a three month internship and you can

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,460
apply in February March for the May to

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,320
August internship or September to

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,770
October for the December to March

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,110
internship how it works for applicants

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,000
is they fill out an eligibility form to

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,920
make sure they fit our application

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,140
criteria and our website is actually

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,960
built in Django so if you're interested

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,210
in helping us out I'll be sprinting on

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:14,320
Monday on the on the outreach you django

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:15,720
web site so applicants find a project

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,840
they contact

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,500
and they ask a lot of questions be

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,960
prepared for a lot of questions the best

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,430
applicants make multiple contributions

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,010
to the project during this six-week

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,750
application period and then afterwards

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,490
they fill out an application form to say

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,660
yes I'm still interested in the

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:40,650
internship so last round we had 200

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:43,320
people make in a contribution to an open

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,450
source project and 70% of them had at

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,380
least two contributions that they made

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:52,470
to a project and we selected 44 interns

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,410
for the last round there's all sorts of

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,970
outreach easy projects that participate

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,250
definitely Python projects Django

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,340
projects and a lot of other different

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,860
kinds of projects that participate so

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,520
how can a project get involved in

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,400
outreach e so you need a coordinator and

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,290
at least one mentor sometimes they're

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,030
the same person but oftentimes it's

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,360
better if they're separate we do

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,890
encourage Co mentorship also the

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,340
projects that participate need to

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:25,410
provide funding for one intern but our

00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,750
Ricci does have general funds that we

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,440
get from companies that sponsor outreach

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,440
E and so we can sometimes give projects

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,900
an additional intern if they have a lot

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,820
of really good applicants if you're

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,640
going to get involved in outreach e as a

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,830
mentor you need to have a project that

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,400
the intern can work on so the mentor

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,560
proposes the project and during the

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,810
six-week application period there's a

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,730
lot of applicants that come in and this

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,610
is really a test of your community is

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,740
our documentation good do we have enough

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:02,160
newcomer friendly issues so that these

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,990
applicants can have enough work do we

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,290
have people who can answer questions on

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,410
our community forums so it's a really

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,290
good way of seeing firsthand whether

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,810
your project is newcomer friendly so if

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,540
you're interested in outreach e you can

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,520
check us out check out the website

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,410
there's also a link to the websites

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,080
github repo if you would like to help us

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,750
out with some Django work there's lots

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,840
of open issues if you're interested in

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,270
outreach e tonight

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,900
in the open space at 7:00 p.m. on Friday

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,510
in room 14 and you can also find us on

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,940
Twitter thank you

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,940
[Applause]

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:50,280
thank you all right next up we have Josh

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,530
lo talking about an edgy blocks hello my

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,150
name is Josh and today I'm going to

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,220
introduce you to a project that I

00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,940
created when I was twelve called edgy

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,780
box

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,900
I'm a 14 year old software developer so

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,840
what is edgy box edgy box is a drag and

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,600
drop version of Python 3 each box allows

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,450
you to build basic and complex pison 3

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,450
programs using a scratch like interface

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,600
and it is being used in schools in 72

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,220
countries across the world

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,520
Etsy blocks is an easy way to learn the

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,490
Pisces 3 syntax ng blocks has a Python

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,530
sweet code under blocks which allows you

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,690
to see what you're building in pison

00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,630
whilst allowing you to use an

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:37,530
easy-to-use interface to build Python

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:40,170
programs each box is an educational tool

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,570
to help younger children learn pison as

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,480
your blocks have been proved to help

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:49,380
lots of people get into Python allowing

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,410
a small barrier to entry system to build

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,110
pies and programs edgy box is also a

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,780
platform for educators so we provide a

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,850
lot of resources and lesson plans eat

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,630
free cheese on the website to get

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:07,200
started straight away so why what is the

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:09,570
need for edge books in schools scratch

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,140
is being introduced at an early age and

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:17,940
then python is introduced scratch chip

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:19,860
iesson is a huge gap so edgy box is a

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,300
solution to bridge the gap between the

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,340
two introducing edgy box edgy box is

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,460
still the same scratch like interface

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,800
which has the blocks but instead allows

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:35,100
you to see the Python code allowing you

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,440
to make the transition easier here is a

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,360
quick demo of edgy blocks so you drag

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,880
and drop the blocks from the toolbox on

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,700
the left this is the raspberry pi

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,400
version and you can see that you're

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,900
building up a Python program you drag

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,710
and drop the blocks connect them

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,800
together to build up the program on

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:57,470
the screen here is a simple print

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,210
statement inside a while true loop which

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,210
will don't run in person

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,020
we will now switch to pace and view

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,089
which brings up text editor which allows

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,310
you to further develop the Python code

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,380
you can never run it by the click of a

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:16,490
button and there with your PI's and code

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,800
running HG box runs on two major

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,020
platforms the rusty PI and the mic

00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,350
commit the two links are below if you'd

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,660
like to visit those editions in the

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,000
future I'm also introducing Adafruit

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,340
circuit pison which you all got in your

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,990
swag bags the jammers m0 which also

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:38,210
works with AG blocks in the future hg

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,650
blocks is a free to use program but

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,080
unfortunately it's not free to run

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,540
because I have to buy the boards to test

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,780
it so a patreon page ISA if you'd like

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,460
to support me with a shoe box thank you

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,560
and thank you to the community for

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:56,260
allowing me to speak you can find out

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,260
more on the links on the slide thank you

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,030
that was awesome thank you

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,240
all right next up we have Mahmud Hashemi

00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:18,370
on restructuring data in Python good

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,140
evening Cleveland we're excited for some

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,580
Python I see they say you should start a

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,050
presentation with a quote so I've got

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,720
one here for you it's one I think you've

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:29,380
all heard before flats is better than

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:32,740
nested by Tim Peters pep 20 a little

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,110
while ago the Zen of Python

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,900
so with that Zen movement we move into a

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,720
new quote namespaces are one honking

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:45,670
great idea let's do more of those that's

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,370
also Tim Peters f20 the Zen of Python so

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,560
you know these two statements in tension

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,200
are a lot to meditate on and I think

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,180
that meditation may have been lost or

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,740
maybe just not available to all the Java

00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,420
developers in the world because we end

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,060
up with data that looks like this and

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,910
note the ellipses this goes far off the

00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,410
page so and it gets a lot worse when you

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,930
get into enterprise environments and are

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:12,190
just dealing with web services so what

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:16,150
do we do about this reality plum it's a

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:20,260
tool that is the nested data operator

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,940
for Python no longer is flat strictly

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,790
better than nested it's a choice that

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,090
you can make truly Zen all right you can

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,280
find it now it's on github please have a

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,590
look but let me talk to you about what

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,420
it actually does so first up I think

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,710
this is maybe the most common case and

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,440
the first few times I wrote something

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,660
like this this is what it did basically

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,630
it gave you a dotted syntax for reaching

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,450
into dictionaries you know basically

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,000
here we have a target galaxy system

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,770
planet Jupiter not a great structure for

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,520
the data but with glom it's no problem

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:56,530
right you can just move straight ahead

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,000
but it goes B but but see here's the

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,630
whole reason you need that in the first

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,840
place if you have a line like this right

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:07,630
basically you could get four different

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,860
exceptions now experienced developers

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,300
are going to actually split this up into

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,240
a bunch of different try except blocks

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,000
but it still gets to be pretty tedious

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,930
for these last two exceptions none type

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
object has no edge

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,160
you get item and list indices must be

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,980
integers I encourage you to figure out

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,690
which of the problem which of the data

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,280
structures actually had this problem to

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,890
one where I'm accessing beers one where

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,170
I'm accessing see what we need is we

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,850
need good error messages right it's more

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,010
than just a dotted syntax for reducing

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,990
lines of code it actually gives you an

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,240
error message that says path access

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,390
error could not access see in index two

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,300
of path ABC got error you know it gives

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,350
you the underlying error and you

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,170
definitely know worse off than when you

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,510
started and in fact much better but it

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,130
goes much further than just access right

00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,110
because what I realized over the years

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,030
is that I don't just need to access one

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,280
field I need to access a whole series of

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,460
them to build a new object and what I

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,200
get there is basically I should be able

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,110
to accept more than just strings as

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,060
input instead in this case we've

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,090
extended the data structure to add earth

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,480
with our 1 moon and Jupiter with its 69

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,060
moons and you know I want a list of

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,310
names and a list of moon counts and with

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,140
glom you can do that you just say give

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,360
me a data structure that looks like this

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,740
so it's related to the list

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,110
comprehension i love list comprehensions

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,330
because the data that you get out looks

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,090
like the code itself and in this case

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,280
it's similarly declare a structure hand

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,920
at the target and it renders something

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,300
like this and so for this kind of system

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,190
we've just sort of ended up calling it

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,930
like an object template you know how

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,460
when you're making an HTML template like

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,680
with Django or something like that you

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,260
basically say oh yeah take this value

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,420
and put it in this div and take this

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,880
value and make an you know unordered

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,500
list from it here it's very similar

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,060
except you're saying take this object

00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,980
and please make it into a dictionary

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:04,600
take this object and please make it into

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:07,390
a list so on and so forth so to review

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,760
we have path based access declarative

00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:13,150
data transformation and readable

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,310
meaningful error messages and to go a

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,020
little further features I don't have

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,390
time for it has built-in data

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,760
exploration and debugging tools so right

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,030
now I have glomm specs as I called them

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,330
that are dozens of lines long replacing

00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,380
code that's hundreds of lines long and

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,640
but at the same time it can be kind of

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,530
complicated to debug so

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,300
actually has a built-in debugger thing

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,910
and it even has a command-line tool it's

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,720
like JQ but there's no DSL you just

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,400
write Python so yes with that I would

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,380
encourage you to pip install glom today

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,270
and if you want to know more I've

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,520
written a blog post about it said that

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,160
URL said of mental org and also there's

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,440
an open session tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

00:22:51,160 --> 00:23:01,210
hope to see you in room 10 thank you

00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:03,610
very much thank you all right next up we

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,070
have a clang vu talking about a Python

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:12,490
code style for black blind programmers I

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:16,090
might be blind hi everyone so I'm gonna

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:19,060
talk about a KO style fall by members so

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,190
why is it a challenge because it's a

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:25,120
Python it's indentation based language

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:27,460
so that's the number one reason it very

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,280
difficult for for bimah rumors there

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,260
what the waiting a code in a way by

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,990
remedy code they have screen readers

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,540
that read all up the character on a

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,730
screen for them so this Python determine

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,310
the scope by using space so I said he's

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,440
very challenging for them and I hope

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,210
that by the end of the talk we can do

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,670
something better to help them because

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:52,600
Python is very popular right now and not

00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,510
being able to code in pythons is a it's

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,790
a very it's a big barrier for for

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:01,890
program of primer grammar to be keep

00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:06,190
keep up with us so I started indentation

00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:10,210
raise your hand if you use space raised

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,550
hand if you you tap so about 95 people

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:17,260
here using spay and about few people

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:20,980
using tab so if you use a apply

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,290
maramures the video read the first line

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,230
is deaf too and then the second line con

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,450
as space I play with open text and our

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,430
turtle I it gonna read space race play

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,800
space race play it depends on a

00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,930
different configuration but some some

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,180
different configuration it's gonna kind

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,850
of read the second lies at space for

00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,560
realized Spade 8 start easier for them

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,890
to keep track tup was a what a level

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:49,210
indentation so how how happy

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,450
stay help oh by the way don't don't do

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,150
that

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,280
comment on the size because imagine like

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,020
you're gonna read all this pain in

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,140
betweens and I've gone right I'm crazy

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,420
so you do you comment on top of your

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,250
code it'd make it easier for them to

00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:10,179
read and to do it for my lemon

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:13,330
limitation purpose so this this actually

00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:16,929
this example copy straight from hell

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,720
eight so it's valid for most of us but

00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:23,590
imagine if for the screen readers this

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,330
is ten space so it's not usual see if

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,850
they configure their screen reader to be

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,290
forced paid a space and it comes across

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:34,000
like tens way it's pretty confusing and

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:42,970
also what what it means we have tap is

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:45,910
like 2.5 taps way so yeah if the best

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:49,030
way for for for this is avoid doing

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:53,200
lineup you should just do this instead

00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:55,660
so line everything's on on the level in

00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,910
indentation make it consistent to author

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:03,429
of your code long string so we all know

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,010
about a 80 character limit and I believe

00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:08,260
some some developer right before me he's

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,400
out for that too so that's a very many

00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,090
people have different opinion on that

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,980
but if you follow by programmers they

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,559
actually have no meaning for them so it

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,960
betters if you concatenate all the swing

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,630
together don't split the string it'll

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,590
look better it keeps your linting quiet

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:29,169
but for them it no no meaning so if if

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:33,040
keep all the string together easier to

00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:35,380
read easier to understand to light

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,590
separation actually is too long so I

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,380
have to pull up a root code so this is

00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:44,110
one of the root code and you can see in

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,880
here really long function and no

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,130
separation what I mean by celebration is

00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,700
that usually if you have a code block

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,290
you select by a pine why but for Piper

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,210
members they they have they have no

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,460
meaning so separate your code by playing

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,740
why it's just great

00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,670
more noise so they had to skip that when

00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:09,200
you want to read a code

00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:13,210
so yeah be very considerate when you use

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,210
your blank line to separate your code

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,390
that's my favorite because if if some of

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,520
people who work with me before they will

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,400
recognize us because I am fed up putting

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,530
diagram into my dog string easier for me

00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,150
to read easier for people to follows but

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,580
not so much for five members because I

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,050
laid with does it code they can mix and

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,930
elevate they don't know what what it is

00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:40,580
about so try to put words into your dog

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:43,300
string don't try to use a diagram so

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,010
what we can do to of to to help them

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,630
first of all reach out to them be

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,120
open-minded you read code and you

00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,450
seasoning we're subtitle but yeah I keep

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,580
200 elided 200 character lungs it may

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,120
bear there may be there a reason for it

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,970
and be be helpful to them reach out to

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,480
them I I do my research only for two

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,400
people so the number of people I know is

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,350
very limited so if you know more people

00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,160
through shouts with them help them do

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,300
what you can and also this is a program

00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,900
I was talking about

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:21,590
it's called NVDA is a non-visual desktop

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:23,960
access so it was written entirely on on

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,410
Python so the problem with that is only

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,020
work for Windows so Linux Mac they

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,000
pretty much have no choice so weird if a

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,730
Python developers we can help them reach

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,280
at that that we really helped for for

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,080
our communities and if you have any

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,850
suggestion you don't agree with what I

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,370
suggesting send me an email and let's

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,450
discuss and then make it happen thank

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,450
you thank you thank you

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:57,970
next step we have Alex Rosengarten on

00:28:53,249 --> 00:29:00,669
music from chaos thank you my name is

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,450
Alex this is my first PyCon I'm excited

00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:07,899
to be here I'm presenting music from

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,419
chaos audio find the Lorenz attractor so

00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,100
I'm using a small computer music library

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,259
that I wrote with a friend called ha

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,330
computer music and we're answering the

00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:19,299
question is Python an instrument I say

00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,249
yes you can find the github link here

00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,320
I'll short after the talk so I'm going

00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:25,119
to talk about oscillators a voltage

00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:32,379
control oscillator and then the Lorenz

00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:35,049
attractor so first what is an oscillator

00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:37,450
an oscillator is in some sense the

00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:40,360
atomic unit of an audio file or sound

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,830
you can visualize them pretty and see

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,200
that they're a pretty intuitive concept

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,210
you have for instance like three basic

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,080
oscillators you have a sine wave a

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:52,950
square wave and a triangle wave and they

00:29:50,080 --> 00:30:01,980
sound something like this

00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:04,539
just a pure tone somewhere in between

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,749
now an oscillator on its own is not

00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:10,419
super useful for making meaningful music

00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:13,480
we would like some way to control the

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:14,919
frequency over time and thus we are

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,499
brought to the voltage controlled

00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:20,019
oscillator so I just get an intuition

00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:22,389
about how these work more or less we

00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:25,330
have a control signal T in this case

00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:27,909
it's just x equals x or at each time

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,679
step plot the time step and you can see

00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:32,830
that when you apply a voltage controlled

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,159
oscillator to it it increases linearly

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,919
so the frequency gets increase is

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,059
proportional to the control signal and

00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,600
you can do all sorts of interesting

00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:46,779
control signals you know maybe a basic

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,059
case if you have flat Oh forgive me if

00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:50,980
you have a flat control signal you'll

00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:53,619
have a wave that is completely

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,429
consistent and you know if you have

00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:58,869
fancier control signals like a parabola

00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:02,789
you can get a more interesting output

00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:06,059
wave now given all this

00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:09,380
we can use oh one last thing now even

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,549
with a voltage control it's still not

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,399
you don't have all the tools we need in

00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:19,500
order to make meaningful music we would

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:21,870
like some way to digitize or you know

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,850
make make distinct notes so we offer a

00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,070
few more functions so we have a raw

00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,830
control signal here's the sine we

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:32,370
discretize or digitize the signal in two

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:35,549
distinct steps we map those discretized

00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,919
signals into frequency like meaningful

00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:39,809
frequencies on a musical scale for

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,580
instance like the chromatic scale and

00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,559
then we apply a voltage control

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,730
oscillator to it and we get an audio

00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:53,010
output so here's what this sounds like

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:55,529
more or less kind of repetitive but

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:59,460
getting more interesting now what if we

00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:02,880
took something you know that was chaotic

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:05,159
or used a more complicated or

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,130
complicated control signal in order to

00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:12,960
power our music and now we enter the

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:15,389
Lorenz system so Lorenz is a nonlinear

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,539
ordinary set of ordinary differential

00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:20,100
equations that's used to measure

00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:23,880
convection in fluid systems and it has

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,220
this kind of a shape if you plotted the

00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,230
XY and z axes it would look something

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,730
like this now we could listen to this

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,309
directly because they are value 2

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,409
negative 1 and 1 but if we use voltage

00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:36,630
control signals we can get more

00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:38,610
interesting more meaningful music so now

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:41,010
with my remaining time would like to

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:46,320
show music composed by my friend Jason

00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:48,690
door I'll have you note that because

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,610
this is a chaotic signal it's very

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,570
sensitive to the initial conditions so

00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:59,250
here we have initial conditions 2 3 & 4

00:32:53,570 --> 00:33:00,020
is done rendering and this is what chaos

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,250
sounds like

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,250
[Music]

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh keep that playing though I mentioned

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,230
the initial conditions and like what

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,820
does chaos really mean at the end of the

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:22,040
day so here I'm running this one more

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,730
time with the initial conditions that

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:30,320
are slightly perturbed or slightly off

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:34,820
and what that means is that as time goes

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:38,480
on if you were to start playing these at

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,940
the same time they start out very

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,130
similar but then get it's like slowly

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,740
they get more and more difference are

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,550
generating entirely different audio

00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:51,770
files or

00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:55,760
music as a result yeah so that's that's

00:33:51,770 --> 00:34:04,770
audio file hey officer Loren system

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:06,570
thank you Thank You Lee very much it was

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,639
awesome all right next up we have Sean

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:15,750
ah Gordon McKeon on legacies of

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:17,030
disruption hello on August 6 1945 the

00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,290
White House put out a press release

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,830
blotting the greatest achievement of

00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,389
organized science in history that

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,619
achievement was the atomic bomb which

00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,560
that morning had been dropped in

00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,760
Hiroshima Japan between 60 and 70

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,889
thousand people were killed immediately

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,169
with tens of thousands and more later

00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,080
succumbing to injuries and radiation

00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:39,419
sickness we can debate what it means for

00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,950
an achievement to be great surely many

00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:42,929
scientists would prefer to think of the

00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:45,179
discovery of penicillin or the moon

00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,429
landing as the best part of their legacy

00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,470
but in one way the White House was

00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:51,300
clearly correct the atom bomb was the

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,490
most significant political achievement

00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,270
of organized science and the achievement

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:58,440
had the biggest impact on world politics

00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,210
many scientists prefer not to think

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,369
about politics but the work that

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,290
scientists do has always had political

00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:06,480
consequences and it's the same for

00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,010
technology we like to think of our work

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,800
as a political even as the

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,349
counter-examples pile up corporations

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,580
and governments surveilling citizens

00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:16,140
blackbox algorithms that tell us what

00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,630
news to read and what people to trust

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,570
world leaders threatening nuclear war on

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,150
Twitter we can learn from the nuclear

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,650
physicists of the early 20th century

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:28,109
their discoveries were truly disruptive

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:32,369
they move fast and they nearly broke the

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:34,020
world back in September of 1933 less

00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:36,780
than 12 years before the first atom bomb

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,310
was dropped Ernst Rutherford often

00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,650
called the father of nuclear physics

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,050
labeled the prospect of nuclear weapons

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,150
moonshine he was hardly alone in his

00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,500
opinion Albert Einstein had described

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,200
the pursuit of nuclear fission as

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,630
shooting birds in the dark in a country

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,670
where there are a few birds and Niels

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,220
Bohr another luminary repeatedly

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,170
dismissed the possibility these people

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,140
had seen an LED multiple scientific

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,680
revolutions why were they then so sure

00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,180
that another revolution couldn't happen

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,700
perhaps they didn't want to believe I

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,940
loved science that Edward Teller I met

00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,339
had

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,109
project scientist but also it offered a

00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:15,960
possibility for escaping this doomed

00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:18,030
society Theodore von Karman agreed I

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,950
felt I'd had enough of political and

00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,210
government upheavals he wrote I was

00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,569
enveloped in the feeling that only

00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,310
science is lasting Lise Meitner known as

00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,560
the mother of the bomb wrote that back

00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,690
then one could love one's work and not

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,550
always be tormented by the fear of the

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,290
ghastly and malevolent things that

00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,589
people might do with beautiful

00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,060
scientific findings once it became clear

00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:41,040
to scientists that atom bombs were in

00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,540
fact possible many of them clung to the

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,099
belief that these bombs would somehow

00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,140
save the world

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,089
Eugene Vagner who helped launch the

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,859
Manhattan Project believed that nuclear

00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:52,560
weapons would require a world government

00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:53,790
to control them he wrote we expected

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,619
that these controls if they were

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,569
effective enough to abolish atomic

00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,630
warfare would be effective enough to

00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:02,190
abolish all other forms of war the same

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,869
hope was shared by carl friedrich von

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,920
weizsäcker who worked on the nazis

00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:08,160
nuclear program

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,400
he wrote mankind itself can only survive

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,319
if war as an institution is abolished in

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,150
their words we can hear the echo of

00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,970
Alfred Nobel the man who created the

00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:20,339
Nobel Prize and the weapon dynamite he

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,960
said perhaps my factories will put an

00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:24,630
end to war sooner than your congresses

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,010
on the day that to army corpse can

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,619
usually annihilate each other in a

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,990
second all civilized nations will surely

00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:34,290
recoil with horror and disband their

00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,940
troops there's the kind of magical

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,180
thinking in the words of these men that

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,160
a new technology could just by existing

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,530
and with no thought for politics bring

00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,150
about world peace the fact that the

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:49,170
technology in question was a devastating

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,819
weapon only adds to the irony in just 12

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,130
years the atom bomb transformed from

00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:55,950
moonshine to reality changing our world

00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,390
along with it most nuclear physicists

00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,690
dismissed the feasibility of the bomb

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,700
even into the late 1930s while

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,650
individual scientists will always get

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,390
things wrong the fields collective

00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,609
failure to identify the bomb as a

00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,920
dangerous if unlikely outcome and to

00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:12,500
address it set the stage for the

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,450
destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:19,650
for the Cold War and it threatens us

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:22,360
still today the tech industry may face a

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,690
similar reckoning what dangers are

00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,820
being today what dystopian futures and

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,400
black mirror episodes are we dismissing

00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,230
as impossible what tools do we still

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,500
blindly insist are going to save the

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,540
world when they might destroy it even

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,400
more importantly how do we face up to

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,890
these dangers how do we hold our

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,610
communities our companies our industry

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,980
accountable

00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,230
what kind of collective organizations

00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,600
should we build what kinds of collective

00:38:47,230 --> 00:39:01,950
actions should we take what is our

00:38:49,600 --> 00:39:01,950
legacy going to be thank you

00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,920
all right next up Travis all the font

00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,060
speaking on more sustainable open-source

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,830
excellent Thank You Lynn and thank you

00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:15,040
for that talk I say make more

00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,000
open-source not war it's actually been

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,250
true as I've gone around the world

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,570
amazing the amount of that the impact

00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,890
that open-source can have on bringing

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,720
people together from all walks of life

00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,490
you might know me from some of the open

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,200
source that contribute in the past I've

00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,720
made a career out of working on open

00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,760
source from numpy down to a Conda and

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,310
numba working with an unfocused

00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,320
organization and then promoting other

00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,960
projects like tasks Boca and then the PI

00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,880
data ecosystem come sprint with me we're

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,470
doing something again xnd IO we're in a

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,970
sprint here at PyCon it's array

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,170
libraries primitive libraries for red

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,000
computing if you want to get into it

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,400
we're gonna get into it so come it'll be

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,990
fun during the sprints sustainable

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,430
open-source is very personal for me I've

00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,230
been doing this for 20 years and I've

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,400
had little kids when I started and I

00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,620
wondered how in the world are gonna pay

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,030
for their college working at open-source

00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,100
giving my software away when I started

00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,210
giving away sci-fi as a grad student

00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,660
they're now older and they're in college

00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,950
and I'm still trying to figure that out

00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,810
uh-huh but it's something I care deeply

00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,980
about so I've worked in industry and

00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,990
I've led companies I've started

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,120
companies to try to help people get paid

00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,740
well working open-source doing it again

00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,410
with Quon site we've come up with an

00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,820
approach to hire people to work mentor

00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,680
people grow them in their careers

00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,790
connect them to companies we actually

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,750
have this concept called sustainable

00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:27,100
open-source that connects open-source

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,310
communities with companies that need

00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,750
them we provide the companies with

00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,310
prioritization on their features with

00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,170
the ability to hire from the open-source

00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,420
communities as well as mitigating their

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,920
open-source risk and the communities we

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,080
offer the ability to connect their

00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,850
roadmaps and collect their ideas and

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,650
present them in fundable nuggets so that

00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,670
companies can absorb them well so we

00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,710
call that are sustainable open source

00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,750
subscription we were doing that at

00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:52,120
anaconda continuum as it became anaconda

00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,890
we were doing this and grew a 35 40

00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,770
person team it's the foundation of

00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,570
anacondas open-source actions today that

00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,980
could grow that can broaden that's why I

00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,490
spun out of anaconda to grow it even

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,410
farther

00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,150
so we're organizing roadmaps were

00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,310
organizing community ideas presenting

00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,290
the companies but we need help we need

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,730
people we need lots of people we need

00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,230
community minded people developers

00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,300
evangelist community managers project

00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,160
managers and we need them part-time

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,770
full-time

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,750
freelancers

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,210
so introducing open team go to the

00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,430
website open team quan site comm you can

00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,530
go there read sign up basically show

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,760
your available it's not much now right

00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,080
now it's basically a chance to raise

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,150
your hand and say hey I came available

00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,760
for this amount of time you need to be

paid this much and it's a way to connect

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,690
eventually we're looking for occasional

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,010
part-time freelancers you want to come

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,460
work full-time for Quan site they'll be

00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,660
great

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,760
you got to be passionate about open

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,290
source in the near future find

00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,640
collaborators advisers people to help

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,440
you connect to open source projects

00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,210
outreach is interesting I'm probably

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,030
gonna follow up with them so come join

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,220
us the website is open team.com helping

00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,410
about quan site comm it's got this sub

00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,500
title there you just go in and log in

00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,730
with your github and become a part of it

00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,990
become a part of the next adventure

00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,990
thanks everybody

00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:08,330
[Music]

00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:15,950
Thank You chess all right next up we

00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:17,900
have James Powell code or Die so this is

00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:22,340
code or Die it's a lightning talk I'm

00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,110
Jay hi everyone I'm James hi how are you

00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,540
doing you can follow me on Twitter I'm

00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,830
don't use this code on Twitter I wanted

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,150
to show you something kind of different

00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,260
usually for lightning talks I show you

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,000
something kind of wild

00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,910
this is actually an idea that I like and

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,500
I think it's actually a good idea and

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,510
it's unfortunately idea where I can't

00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,700
really find the time to do it I can't

00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,990
find the resources and what I'm trying

00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,420
to get out of this talk is an

00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:47,150
opportunity for me to motivate you to

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,640
actually motivate me to actually finish

00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,730
this thing so let me show you the idea

00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,350
and if you like it maybe on Monday we

00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,300
can sprint on it tell me what you think

00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,770
so a lot of you have played board games

00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,450
a lot of you are familiar with one of

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,520
the classy board games risk so let's

00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,680
imagine risk - board game we've all

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,320
played it looks kind of like this let's

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,330
take it let's set it in space let's add

00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,250
spaceships and solar systems and all the

00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,260
couch Vermont that you'd expect let's

00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,580
make it real time let's take away the

00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,260
board because we don't need a board and

00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,960
instead of a board we'll put in a JSON

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,400
API and when I teach you to play this

00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,930
game or if you're a first time player

00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,640
I'll give you a handout and on that

00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,500
handout I'll say there exists this tool

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,060
called HTTP there's also tool called

00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,070
curl but here's just a couple of things

00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,020
to just type into your console type in

00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,790
this oh you get to see what solar

00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,290
systems are out there type in this you

00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,420
could to see what are the ships where I

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,700
am currently you type in this Oh what's

00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,410
going on in solar system number 32 you

00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,260
type in that you say oh look I'm moving

00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,970
my ship to some particular position and

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,680
you can see it's a very simple very

00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,600
low-level API the actual amount of work

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,700
to put this together is intentionally

00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,740
minimal now when I give you something

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,780
like this as a programmer what's your

00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,610
first intention well this is ship 12

00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,190
moving to Mars what if I make that ship

00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,630
23 and what if instead of Mars I move it

00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,070
to Venus and without teaching you

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,870
anything about the game you're already

00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,400
trying to figure out certain aspects of

00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,340
you know how the game works how the

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,410
pieces move it's pretty easy to play now

00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,580
in the first 30 minutes I can teach you

00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,020
how to play out and move the ships

00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,000
around how to shoot other ships how to

00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,160
take over solar systems which is like a

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,869
handout of some simple API calls

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,410
but what if you have to move a hundred

00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:23,420
ships around round two let's up the ante

00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,920
and maybe what you need to do is you

00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,210
write a bash script you'd come to me

00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,039
you'd say I need to move 100 ships I

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,480
can't type a hundred commands in real

00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,089
time so I'll write a simple bash script

00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,680
I'll move them all at once but the API

00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,390
output from this is in JSON it's gonna

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,490
be really hard to read it's gonna look

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,510
something like this and so you're gonna

00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,160
say you know what I'm gonna write a

00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,950
little reporting tool or maybe I'll

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,079
write a web front-end and if I hundreds

00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:47,180
of ships moving in real time interacting

00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:49,039
in real time even if I if I have

00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,930
scripting to help me out I can't

00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,760
actually win the game so I might need to

00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,039
write bots I might need to use some ml

00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,450
or AI mechanisms and what you can see is

00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,770
the thing I like about this game is it

00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,859
starts very simple and it gets very

00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,750
complex even newbies can play and it's a

00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:04,309
motivation to learn programming it's a

00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,650
motivation to improve your programming

00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:09,109
and what I like about it is through this

00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,390
automation approach to programming you

00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,740
have a very immediate motivation when I

00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,420
do corporate training and people ask

00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,039
what's the business use case for a meta

00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,539
class or a decorator I don't have an

00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:19,910
answer for them but if you come to me

00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:21,440
and say look I wrote this code I'm I'm

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,029
losing every game I play against my

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,740
friends and I say well you know what

00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:26,839
maybe you need to try a new approach

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,920
maybe you need to use flasks instead of

00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:29,960
something else maybe you need to use a

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,730
pull API instead of a push API the

00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,859
motivation becomes very clear and very

00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,990
immediate and one thing I really like

00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:38,930
about this idea is as you're learning to

00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:41,420
improve your code as you're learning to

00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,430
figure out what neat what it takes for

00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,869
you to beat your friends you realize

00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,250
perfect code doesn't really matter code

00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:50,140
quality isn't the most important thing

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:53,240
what's important is only one thing

00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,099
galactic domination so if you like the

00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,569
idea it's on github the rules it's on

00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:58,190
github I've started working on this come

00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:59,599
find me on Monday maybe we can sprint on

00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,770
this maybe we can finish it I don't

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,349
think there's a lot of work to finish it

00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:04,849
maybe we can start you know at a point

00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:06,770
where we have some games running and we

00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:09,130
can see if this idea works or not thank

00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,130
you so much

00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:19,370
all right we're gonna figure out some

00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,000
display stuff over here who's going to

00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:24,770
the pie lady's auction tomorrow anyone

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,600
if you don't know about it um it's

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,310
happening tomorrow like 6:30 or it

00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,870
starts around 6:30 but doesn't actually

00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:33,590
start until I get there so maybe like

00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:36,070
6:45 or 7 and if you haven't registered

00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:39,560
for it yet you can register at the door

00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:43,100
and all the money that we raise will go

00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,380
to women and who needs to attend Pike

00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,570
Pike on their registration or hotel or

00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,220
something like that so yeah you should

00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:53,150
all come and if you don't want to bid

00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:55,840
maybe like bit up people to help raise

00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:59,900
more money that'd be awesome

00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:03,280
maybe maybe Harry can help me tell some

00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:07,310
jokes cuz I'm horrible at jokes what

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,840
over Ethel tickets yeah um the at the

00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:11,930
auction we have some raffle tickets to I

00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:16,060
have no idea what the the prizes are but

00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:16,060
there will be raffle tickets sorry Katie

00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:24,920
Harry you want to vamp with me he's much

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:26,510
more he much much better at jokes hi

00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,710
everyone how much time do we actually

00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:33,290
have to waste Lynne cuz I've got a joke

00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:34,430
that takes about three days yeah we

00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,590
could have somebody up next instead of

00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,690
Caleb who was after Caleb was it Sean

00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,420
Scott there you go you go instead it

00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,190
gets her up here won't have another go

00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,620
if I might the favorite joke I heard

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:48,470
recently was from a Polish programmer

00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:51,890
and she said um this is my grandma's

00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:54,020
favorite joke and it's about a a program

00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,740
was walking down the road and she finds

00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,130
a horseshoe on the floor and she picks

00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,260
it up

00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:03,910
she looks it she turns it over and on

00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,910
the other side there's a horse

00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:14,599
it's a bit of a wacky one that one did I

00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:18,230
hear the one about the broken pencil

00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:20,090
don't worry it's pointless

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:24,050
[Laughter]

00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,050
well we know that's enough James come on

00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,680
pirate programmer walks into a bar and

00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,560
he's got a parrot on his shoulder and

00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,020
it's going pieces of seven pieces seven

00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,670
pieces of seven and the barman goes I

00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,550
think there's something wrong with your

00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:41,160
bird mate and he goes yeah he's got a

00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:44,430
parity error and one goes yeah I thought

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,930
he was a bit off it's double that's got

00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:52,980
a topper that one yeah are you ready to

00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:55,860
go okay thank you he's so much better at

00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:59,070
that than me all right thank you

00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:02,040
we have Scott Shaw crafts on circuit

00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:05,490
Python code and community thank you

00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,170
hello everybody both PyCon people and

00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,690
internet people

00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:12,230
I'm Scott Shaw Croft I'm a freelance

00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:16,470
developer for Adafruit on circuit Python

00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:17,870
I'm gonna show you a live demo so

00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,610
hopefully it works it worked yesterday

00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:23,250
so what I have here is a Adafruit Gemma

00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:26,010
m0 it's a tiny board it's what you see

00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,260
there and what I'm gonna do is I'm just

00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,330
gonna plug it in it's got circuit Python

00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,820
on it for those of you lucky enough to

00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:35,550
be here they're in your swag bags so you

00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:38,700
can try this and what it should be doing

00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:41,910
is it should be doing a rainbow like

00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,710
color shift but it's quite quite dim

00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:46,770
because we don't want to blind people

00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:50,010
when they plug it in and so my goal here

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:52,320
is to turn the brightness up so while I

00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:55,470
plugged it in it showed up as a USB

00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:59,240
Drive here this is the code part of

00:49:55,470 --> 00:50:01,410
circuit Python and what I got was a

00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,830
listing of all the files on the drive

00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:08,070
and on there is a main dot Pi file which

00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,840
I'm going to open an atom and it has big

00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,010
text so you should be able to read it

00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:16,410
and the the one thing I wanted to do was

00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:19,200
set the brightness to one don't want to

00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:24,540
do that so I'll set it to one and then

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:27,390
I'll go file save and it should be

00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,140
brighter I can't actually see it so

00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,140
hopefully it works

00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:36,640
thank you so I wanted to show you how

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,560
easy it is to get started using circuit

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,450
Python I could do it in a lightning talk

00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,780
you can do it in the next three minutes

00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:45,490
if you like that's the code part this is

00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,750
how easy it is to get people using

00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,740
Python on hardware which is super cool

00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:53,890
now I want to talk a little bit about

00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:57,280
the community we have a discord channel

00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:59,380
which is a freely available chat service

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,320
we have a code of conduct and we will

00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:05,470
ban people if they violate it so we keep

00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,350
it a very open space in addition to that

00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:09,970
we have the Adafruit learning system

00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,620
which is a bunch of tutorials on what

00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,890
you can do with circuit Python and

00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:17,260
different pieces of hardware we have all

00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,940
of our code is open source it's based on

00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,770
micro Python you may have heard of it

00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,650
they've done a great job and we've made

00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:26,550
it better for beginners so check out our

00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:28,840
github and we're also on read the docs

00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,790
if you're here at the conference we're

00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,950
having an open space tomorrow and an

00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:36,540
open space on Sunday as well at 2:00

00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:39,940
p.m. in room 20 so come visit us there

00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:43,930
and if you're never coded in your life

00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:45,790
give circuit python a try and if you are

00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,530
a software person like i was and want to

00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,950
try hardware this is great for you as

00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,910
well

00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,910
thank you

00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:00,240
all right last talk of the evening we

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:03,950
have a first-timer actually Sean

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:06,839
Harrington on hacking hacking on 23andme

00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,099
hi guys so I actually work for the

00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,950
Patriots I'm the director of engineering

00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:13,050
there so I do nothing pertaining to this

00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,180
in my day job this is a complete 180 for

00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,069
me so what we're talking about is

00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,900
basically taking twenty three Emmys raw

00:52:17,069 --> 00:52:20,640
data output which I know when you're

00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,609
taking a test can get off of their

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,260
website I've taken that I've taken my

00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:28,520
own data and I've taken DB snip which is

00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:33,000
over a terabyte of data basically tying

00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,609
lots of research publications and she

00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,290
don't want Association studies and

00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:39,030
pulling that that all together to see if

00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:44,280
I can figure out you know what diseases

00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:46,650
pertain to my genome so what's in DB

00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,020
snip that we care about here so what a

00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:51,960
snip is the snip is basically a mutation

00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:53,670
in in your genome so you know I might

00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,559
have an a five percent of the population

00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,049
might have a T that that makes them that

00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,119
person unique that the exact definition

00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,799
is given right here so at least 1% of

00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,270
the population has to have it so it has

00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:06,480
to be somewhat calm and it can't just be

00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:08,010
a chance mutation these G waz allele

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,200
frequencies that we care about these are

00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:13,859
basically big studies that happen across

00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,420
giant populations just to see how how

00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:17,849
rare that that actually the actual

00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,500
allele is and then the third piece here

00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:21,210
is we have the clinical significance so

00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:24,000
this is you know does that allele does

00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:27,869
that allele pertain to a disease such as

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,579
cancer such as diabetes now what do we

00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:32,339
get from 23 me we get this wonderful

00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:35,819
little file here four columns this is

00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:38,369
about 20 megabytes depending on how big

00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:40,079
or how accurate their data was it kind

00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:41,970
of varies here so we take this and we

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,280
take that you know terabyte or two of

00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:49,859
data and we want to we want to do some

00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:51,680
information from it so this is my mic I

00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:55,710
guess I'm obligated to show some

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:59,130
obfuscated IT pipeline diagram here that

00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,150
nobody probably cares about so basically

00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:02,549
what we're doing here in the top left

00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,780
corner is we're taking all that data or

00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:06,040
running it pulled down on all the

00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,350
ancient FTP server into into this

00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,140
this program here doing all sorts of

00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:12,520
funky async multiprocessing stuff to

00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,600
make this actually run in less than a

00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:18,310
day here and we're gonna you know chomp

00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,690
that data down from to two terabytes

00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:23,860
down about fifty gigabytes so what do we

00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:26,260
care about right we've got all these

00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:29,350
these this data now right there's

00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:32,890
there's kind of five types of five five

00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:34,840
labels that these snip reference snips

00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,130
have right so either the reference the

00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,020
reference tip can either be pathogenic

00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,310
meaning it it lends itself to

00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,260
contributing to a disease like diabetes

00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:43,600
it can be likely pathogenic which is

00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,390
just a lesser probability it can

00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,670
represent a drug response like a

00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,170
reaction to methotrexate it can protect

00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:53,610
you from a certain disease which is kind

00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,610
of interesting or gonna be a risk factor

00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,590
so I'm gonna do here is I've got this

00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,880
API all spun up here and this is

00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,140
actually running locally on my server

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,970
here so what I'm gonna do is I've got

00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,680
all this database the Stata base loaded

00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:08,800
here and what we're gonna do is we're

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,620
gonna use my 23andme data here and we're

00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,320
just gonna go ahead and grab that

00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,670
information by hitting a REST API the

00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,890
output of this thing is looks something

00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:20,970
like this it's this big nasty clunky

00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:23,320
JSON output here but what we're gonna do

00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:27,310
is we're gonna use this this little

00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,510
example here so here's one that pops out

00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,460
this is engine interesting to me my

00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,550
father was hospitalized about six months

00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:35,140
ago because he had gall stones to me

00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,090
there's a citation here if we follow

00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,950
this link it takes us to a paper on a

00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,270
gallbladder disease I have the snip

00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,440
that's found at five percent of the

00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,120
population which I would have otherwise

00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,830
not known that I had if I hadn't run

00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:51,280
this so my goal is to find more things

00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:54,340
like this so what's next I've got a

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,110
birds of feather tomorrow it's gonna be

00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,000
at four o'clock in the room 19 if

00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:59,500
anybody wants to come check it out some

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,430
come T few something I don't know

00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,440
because I don't know much about this

00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,630
stuff I want to make it make this a

00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,640
public API service hopefully you can

00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,960
open-source it and then somebody has to

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,180
build something to interface with it

00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,230
hopefully we can do something there so

00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,790
hope you guys hope to see you guys

00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,910
tomorrow

00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:17,770
rue 19 a four o'clock the slides are

00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,160
available on my website laziest
