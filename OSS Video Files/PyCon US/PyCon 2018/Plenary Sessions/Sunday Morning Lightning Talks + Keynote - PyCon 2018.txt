hello hey oh hey awesome good morning so

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:21,689
everyone Thank You Harry

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:22,980
everyone is hungover as I am early makes

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,189
me think that you're not and doing a lot

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,869
better than I feel thank you for being

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,830
here um so this is a last round of

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,829
lightning talks

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,239
I know it's unfortunate but maybe we can

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,980
have like another lightning talk Boff

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
kind of thing I don't know maybe that's

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,340
the thing

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,640
so we'll kick it off with Tim Abbott on

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,399
debugging with coverage hey so I'm

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
Tamara I work on lip which is an open

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,440
source team chat similar to slack and

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,940
things like that and we're very proud

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,590
that we are written in statically typed

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,180
Python 3 you want to learn more about

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,399
that we have a talk about that later

00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,579
today but I'm here to talk to you right

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,379
now

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,719
about debugging with coverage which is

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,700
my favorite new debugging technique so

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,280
many of you are probably familiar with

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,020
the coverage module and Python it tracks

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,939
which lines of code are executed you

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,770
know you start it and end it so you can

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,830
sort of pick the window the main thing

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,759
people use this for is for sort of

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,049
measuring the quality of their test

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,909
suite you run it for your entire test

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,380
suite and then you can see you know sort

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,150
of what fraction of your lines of code

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,530
we're actually run you know there's some

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,180
debate as to you know whether this is

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,070
the best metric ever but it's certainly

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,479
a useful metric in that if you have no

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,159
coverage on something well it definitely

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,400
wasn't run during your test suite and so

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,720
it is completely untested main downside

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,780
of it is that it slows execution a

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,189
little bit and just to give you sort of

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,210
a feel for how it works you know it'll

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,619
write out a nice you know sort of

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,390
machine readable format but it also can

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,820
produce these nice HTML reports you can

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,369
see that a the dilip project is 96%

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,530
covered and if you click on one of these

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,450
modules you get sort of a more detailed

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,520
report on the file so on the left you

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,899
have the lines of code the stuff

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,740
highlighted in red are the lines that

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,930
are not covered and the sort of green

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,899
stuff is what was run and the blank

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,829
lines are blank and so you know this is

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,599
what looks like you've got a function

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,510
that just never got called you know the

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,500
the DEF line is covered because that was

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,410
run at import

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,750
but none of the rest of stuff was cool

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,950
so you know comment debugging situation

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,510
that I'm sure all of you have

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,970
experienced is that you know you've got

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,710
some code and it's a producing sort of a

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,150
confusing result and the things

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,500
reproducible you know maybe it's unit

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,070
tests maybe it's a script you're running

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,209
maybe it's like an API endpoint and the

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,160
traditional solution to this no here's

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,870
sorry here's an example of you know that

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,100
type of code where this would be likely

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,060
to come up you know you've got three

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,120
different reasons why something might

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,770
return and the same value and that value

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,770
is wrong you actually wanted the last

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,620
case for example and the traditional

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,610
solution is you know print debugging you

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,500
know you put a print statement in the

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,790
first one and then you like try to copy

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,020
that to the second one you realize it's

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,520
no good if it prints the exact same

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,500
thing so you put out two or something

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,060
and you know then you'll know which

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,100
which case it is when you run your thing

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,800
and you sort of iteratively do that

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,390
until you figure out what's going on so

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,360
my claim is that this is the wrong way

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,250
to do it and you should instead do

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
something different you run your sort of

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,150
test reproduced or whatever it is with

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,370
coverage it'll just take a few seconds

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,620
and then you get a fancy HTML report of

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,299
exactly what could pass were followed

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,850
when doing whatever you're trying to

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,320
debug so here's you know what that would

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,209
look like with this example so you can

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,160
see you know the first if statement was

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,620
executed you know the result was false

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,720
so it didn't return there the second if

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,890
state when it was executed and then it

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,780
returned there so you know exactly what

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,940
happened here so in this simple case you

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,200
know it may only help you a little bit

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,670
but this is super useful as you got like

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,470
a long function or there's a lot of

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,390
cases you know we have you know the

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,220
keyboard you know shortcuts seen a

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,720
system in Zillow up you know literally

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,220
there is you know like 25 different

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,380
places it can exit with true or false

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,489
and a little boolean thing and you just

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,380
want to know which one you just get it

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,780
immediately and the place where this is

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,130
really safely a ton of time is when you

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,829
know sort of my assumptions - wrong so

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,390
you were confused as to what function

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,040
was actually the source of your problem

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,209
the answer to UM the above you look at

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,590
your function it wasn't even executed

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,450
it's actually like in the caller or

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,769
something like that and it's also pretty

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,060
good just for sort of browsing what's

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,500
happening so you can sort of start with

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,670
you know the entry point that you're

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,350
looking at eating it see exactly what

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,209
could not the one through there look

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,940
into you know what function is inside

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,380
that and so on so I find that this has

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,270
saved me a lot of time over the last

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,130
year or so since I came up with this

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,960
technique so I hope it will save you

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,340
time as well

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,630
one little note yeah this doesn't have

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,460
to be unit tests you know you can write

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,870
a little at coverage decorator to

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,090
surround a function or something for

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,370
your API endpoint and sort of iterative

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,930
iteratively sort of you know test it

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,430
with just about any block of code that

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,780
you have that you expect to be run sort

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,380
of once during whatever your

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,990
reproducible process is the other cool

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,270
thing is that a lot of editors have

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,950
coverage integrations to show you you

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,510
know sort of your full coverage data for

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,760
your test suite but you can actually use

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,850
those literation sorry integrations to

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,230
see the data you know sort of directly

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,150
in your editor rather than having to go

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,020
to this sort of HTML report off to the

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,950
side so that's a pretty cool technique

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,750
and I've got a little bit of time left

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,880
I'll tell you a little bit about look so

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,490
you know it's a fully open source team

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,470
chatting somewhere just like sort of

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,700
what I have time for is that people find

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,110
that sort of conversations and Zula

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,820
panned the equivalent of channels work

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,550
dramatically better than slack we've had

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,750
tons of people coming up to us at PyCon

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,580
this year to tell us that like they

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,950
never want to it's like again the sort

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,940
of basic way this works is we have

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,470
within your a couple no channel there's

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,420
a sort of unread counts for the

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,150
different topics that's sort of the same

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,120
idea as to how email does threading but

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,340
in a chat context so that's what we have

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,810
I hope that you tried this new debugging

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,500
technique and that it saves you a bunch

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,500
of time thanks so much

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:55,440
thank you I am completely guilty of

00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,750
using print statements for debugging all

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,560
right next up we have Johnson Jonathon

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,420
slender's on prompt toolkit 2.0 ok good

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,700
morning everyone thanks for coming so

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,700
early I have a short presentation about

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,440
prom toolkits 2.0 which is a library for

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,930
building even more powerful command line

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,730
applications and as you can see in the

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,200
screenshots maybe you already know it or

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,180
you remember it from I peyten

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,250
so prom to look at is the library that

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,290
is used for taking care of the user

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,470
interface of I Parton if you run it in a

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:28,440
terminal so prom toolkit actually makes

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,090
it possible to have this kind of code

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,950
completion while you're typing like you

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,190
can see the drop-down menus and the

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:39,110
syntax highlighting so it is me I'm

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,160
working for Cisco so prom toolkit I

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,200
Parton as I just said is one of the

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,120
libraries that web prompt rocket is used

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,390
but actually there's the whole ecosystem

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,670
already of applications that use prom to

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,350
look for took it for the UI for instance

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,570
there is BG CLI which is the Postgres

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,970
client there's conch which is the best

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,550
repple there's HTTP prompt which is an

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,060
HTTP client and so on so right now we

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:05,400
have a nice community of about 25 or 25

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,630
applications using prom tickets to

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,680
provide the best user experience

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,970
possible

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,710
in a terminal so if you want to make an

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,090
application like that up here on let's

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,250
say you want to create an application

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,190
that as the user for some HTML as input

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,990
and you want to have syntax highlighting

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,210
and code completion in your terminal

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,250
it's only a couple of lines of code as

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,560
you can see so you define a completer

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,660
you define the lexer that you want and

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,180
you pass everything to the prompt

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,840
function and there you go so it's pretty

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,440
straightforward

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,180
so prompted not just tries to make the

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,830
end application as user-friendly as

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,960
possible with also the development of

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,170
the applications so we put a lot of

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,510
thoughts in our API but there is a

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,250
second use case for prom tickets and you

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,590
can use it for full screen applications

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,150
like for instance if you would want to

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:59,730
build your own text editor or if you

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,350
want to build something like this so all

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,590
of these things are now possible

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,210
with cramtucket 2.0 2.0 it still needs

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,450
to be released but I will do that pretty

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:12,630
soon I hope in the next couple of weeks

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,520
so prompter 2.0 is pretty big thing

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,800
factoring which contains a lot of

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,300
improvements but especially if you want

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,050
to build full screen applications like

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,970
this you can also do things like this

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,340
for instance we have here a dialog

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,490
widget so we have the concept of widgets

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,750
similar to like if you would use or

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:36,510
create a graphical user interface and

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,430
all functionality that we had for simple

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,110
line inputs like syntax highlighting and

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,450
code completion and all VI and he makes

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,960
key bindings they're also available for

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,700
full screen applications we also have a

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,530
couple of higher-level API calls like

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,630
for instance if you want as the user for

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,940
some confirmation you want to do a

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,680
yes/no dialogue for instance it's only

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,620
one function you have to import and call

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,920
and you get a nice dialogue like this in

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,180
pure Python code in your application and

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,400
as you can see everything is

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,080
customizable so if you want to have like

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,510
different colors or you want to put

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,680
something else in the dialogue all of

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,840
that is possible we even have a terminal

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,810
widgets so if you want to trim LML

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,790
emulator as a widget like you see here

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,340
embedded in a dialog window in your

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,470
application that is possible the

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,090
terminal emulator itself will not become

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,950
part of prompt look at it is an external

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,170
library I'm working on but it's

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,920
something you can use you can embed in

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,050
any prompt toolkit application when the

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,840
support is also improved a lot because

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,060
since Windows 10 we have support for

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,130
vt100 escape sequences in our terminal

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,640
and that makes it possible to do the

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:50,070
tendering much more much easier much

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,470
faster and it gives a much better

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,660
experience especially for full screen

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,790
applications so what you see here are

00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,120
three applications running in a normal

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,860
windows console there are many other

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,840
improvements like for instance pigments

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,360
became optional it is much easier to

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,100
define custom key bindings everything

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,900
can be used in an synchronous or

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,170
asynchronous way so you could run it on

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,899
top of I think i/o if you want to it's

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,639
much easier to define text format

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,019
so as you have seen in the dialog

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,089
winners you could embed some kind of

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,189
formatted text formatted text is a

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,160
pretty central concept in prompt ticket

00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:29,819
and you can use it everywhere in a very

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,670
flexible way so if you're interested in

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,490
that check out the github repository the

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,189
2.0 release will follow pretty soon also

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,800
check card DB CLI which is an open

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:44,129
source community of data based clients

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,139
on top of prom toolkit so if you have

00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:53,790
any feedback or questions I would love

00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:56,249
to hear it oh thank you thank you so

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:00,389
much all right next up we have mark

00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:02,879
shields on chaps hello mark shields of

00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:04,529
the talk is chaps the relative dirt

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,110
pants wrapper with a caveat that is not

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,550
really what it is

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,819
I ministry on the quorum structure

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,970
services team at Twitter handles at leap

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:18,629
shade I'm not gonna read the rest of

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,579
that you can read it pants so what is

00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:22,679
pants it's a building packing system for

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,189
Python it has concepts called goals such

00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:29,369
as run binary tests and ripple you can

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:31,049
use these goals with source pantsed path

00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:33,029
the target name - defined and build

00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,339
files allows you to share dependencies

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,559
across the repo and it was developed

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:41,399
using open source at Twitter although I

00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,540
was not involved at all with it so what

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,639
problem are we trying to solve with

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,230
chaps and a mono repo you have multiple

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,730
levels of packaging spacing you if you

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,329
want to use a target you have to type

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,589
out the full path and the target what if

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,869
your testing is different directory it's

00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,100
a different paths I don't want to type

00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:58,259
this out every times which is why I

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,709
wrote this we have seen opt internally

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,910
that run it's to make you time that help

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,129
with this problem but not to do nothing

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,889
to help with early development process

00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,660
or ad hoc operations so some assumptions

00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,129
you have a set directory you're working

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,679
in and levels deep in the source tree

00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,730
you really believe that directory you

00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,350
want to be able to easily do stuff with

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,410
that the pants targets in that directory

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,110
and you have pants as a binary sitting

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,029
the top with repo and

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,329
you use get so if you up see you

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:29,720
subversion well you're out of luck

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:32,779
what is chaps so it's a Python binary in

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,649
pecks format it's built with pants you

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,540
don't have to call pants from the

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,610
top-level repo at all so you actually

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,810
have to to run pants you have to see

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,940
these to the top of directory and then

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,910
call it with the relative path if it's

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,019
installed at the top of the path since

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,120
you're working in the directory you

00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,640
don't need to use full path names you

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,829
just use the bare targets and it works

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,750
the idea is to keep you working on your

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:58,490
code and not working around bill built

00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,500
system issues so this is the way you

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,970
would normally do it with pants if

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,910
you're in your working directory the CD

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,750
back to the top of the repo and then run

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,950
run the pants command or you can just do

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,630
it this way if you're already in the

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,980
directory you can just run it this way

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:17,390
and that'll drop you into the same thing

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,950
as above you also I've got it I'm a big

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,899
fan of the same default so I've got it

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:24,769
set to turn on the ipython repple for

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:27,529
free if you want to list the available

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:30,410
build targets for pants this is the way

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,430
you would do it or you can just do if

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,459
you're in the directory you can just do

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:40,310
chaps list and it'll give you the

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:42,589
targets related you can do chaps binary

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,610
and then the target and it does exactly

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,010
what you think you'll have to use the

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:50,060
full path name anymore you can actually

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,709
even use it to bootstrap itself if you

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,079
want to recursively test all targets you

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:56,360
can do chaps tests two colons that's

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,570
just the pants thing nothing unique two

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,149
chaps I did a special flag that infers

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,140
your test past test paths from your

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,449
current working directory and

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,250
recursively test all the prod targets so

00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:09,260
if you're in your source directory you

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,199
can just run this command muscle memory

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,390
there nothing to do you can actually use

00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,310
chaps to run itself and then run lists

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,660
so if you feel like playing around with

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,519
this I encourage you to see how many

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,350
times you can pass it to itself to run

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:27,079
itself it caveat on this it doesn't

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,260
actually do what you think it does so

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,520
under the hood it's Python to seven

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,700
thank you thank you

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,890
I use Sarge third-party library I also

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,140
use Twitter common library it's it's

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,750
open source it uses the get system

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,700
binary uses the pants top level and then

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,230
it just constructs the relative path

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,150
difference between the top level and

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,860
your current directory limitations it

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:53,410
does not support using targets outside

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,610
of your immediate path so that's a thing

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,990
goals are not inherited from pants

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,430
they're just hard-coded than chaps and

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,590
it works best in conjunction with some

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,710
shell helper functions I'm going to show

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:07,640
you the shell helper functions now in

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:10,910
use that's sort of a muscle memory kind

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,330
of thing work source work test you can

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,060
run setup to set up the path to those

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:19,460
these are fish functions they're not the

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,870
prettiest but they work and then there's

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,760
this is where what ties everything

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:28,610
together it's open source so there's my

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,690
github address for that actually wrote

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,160
is open source and then ported

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,080
internally where I use it daily as part

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,360
of our number workflow and I found a

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,770
bucket bug in the package namespace

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,380
writing these slides so I wouldn't fix

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,330
that if you find it use for it or if you

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:49,030
find a bug or a feature pull request me

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:52,370
thank you thank you thank you very much

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,710
next up we have Paul ganzel on variance

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,150
[Music]

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,820
yeah so my name is Paul ganzel I'm a

00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,110
software engineer at Bloomberg and today

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,610
I'm going to talk about variance which

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,210
is a library I wrote to enable

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,450
convention that I think could improve

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,860
library API designs so how many times

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,930
have you had this problem where you're

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,230
trying to write a library API you know

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,090
as you do and you you want to take

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,950
something that's maybe a file it might

00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:23,080
be a stream or something like that so

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:25,700
you write this sort of ugly type of

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,650
keyword parameter file path or buffer

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,690
and if it's a string it opens a file and

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,740
if it's a stream you just read it or

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,800
maybe you've seen something like this

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,630
where

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,459
you have some function and most of the

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,050
time it just returns one thing but

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,670
sometimes you need some context or

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,470
something extra so there's some

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,080
parameter that changes the return type

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,720
to a tuple right so that kind of messes

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,959
with the the typing there and you know

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,120
this kind of thing happens when you have

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,760
some functionality that has maybe a 90%

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,040
use case or even a 60% use case and then

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,350
you have some other alternate form that

00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,930
happens a reasonable number of times and

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,519
you want to enable that functionality

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,740
there's a pattern that if the function

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,929
that you're creating is a constructor

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,270
function people use which is alternate

00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:11,670
constructors so for example from the

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,760
standard library you have the chain

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,380
class which takes as arguments a number

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
of iterables and then it changed them

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,490
all together and gives you one iterable

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,010
back that is all the things in a row and

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,470
the primary constructor there takes the

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,089
number of it are both it also has an

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,070
alternate constructor from iterable

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,000
which takes an interval of iterables and

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,340
returns an iterable

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,020
so you know I find this pretty clean but

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,820
what if you have a function that has an

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,350
alternate form that's not a constructor

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,150
so maybe I would want something like

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,730
this where you print text and if it's

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,280
string it just prints the string and

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,570
then you can also say oh I'm sending you

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,330
a stream and print the text from a

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,970
stream or maybe I have a file path so

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,830
that's what the library variance does so

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,360
you would decorate your primary function

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,240
with the variance dot primary decorator

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,770
then sort of like how the property

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,140
decorator works this allows you to

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,970
register additional variant forms

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,070
so here I've registered the stream and

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,050
then I've also registered a from file

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,790
path and you'll note that from file path

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,500
is implemented in terms of from stream

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,390
and from stream is implemented in terms

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,480
of the primary and this works

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,190
essentially as you would expect it to so

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,540
why would you use this why wouldn't you

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,730
just do something like have an

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,950
underscore so I think that it's cleaner

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,919
if you use something that's actually

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,929
syntactically marking the relatedness

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,720
then all your variant forms are names

00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:33,630
based under the primary variant this

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,620
also is kind of cleaner on or kinder to

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,840
tab-completion

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,360
and it keeps the top-level API as clean

00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,580
as possible I've also written a Sphynx

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,679
extension that allows you to just sort

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,830
of take all these things and tuck them

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,049
under the primary

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,159
P I so you just use Auto module and all

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,100
your variants will be automatically

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,620
grouped together so what are some use

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,440
cases for this one would be explicit

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,850
dispatch so in this original example I

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,100
had something that takes a string a

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,140
string two things that take a string the

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,080
file path and the text and maybe I also

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,360
want to be able to take a URL it's not

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,460
super easy to dispatch this on type but

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,399
if you use variants you can explicitly

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,200
dispatch you can also have variation in

00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:16,299
return type so for example here

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,250
something that it's a sort of like a

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:20,830
range function but for dates and it's

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,200
lazy by default but I can also create an

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,289
eager variant that will just consume the

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,149
the generator and give you a list you

00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,970
can have variation in async behavior so

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:32,590
you can write an async function and then

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,279
if you have a blocking version of it you

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,169
just create a sync variant and so you

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:43,029
have my funk it's an async generator and

00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:44,470
then my funk it's a generator and you

00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,960
can have variation name caching behavior

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,970
and in fact if you look at how LRU cache

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,309
works it already adds variant functions

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,690
to your functions but so here what I've

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,480
done is I have this get config I've

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,190
decorate it with the LRU cache so when

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,049
you call this twice what's gonna happen

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:03,090
is the first time it grabs the config

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:05,470
the second time it just is a cache hit

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,649
but I also have this no cache very

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,980
variant which which lets you explicitly

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:15,070
grab a brand new instance of your config

00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,610
without clearing your cache and you can

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,840
also see that this primary is

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,929
implemented in terms of the variant so

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,639
you can use the primary as sort of a

00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,830
like a dispatch that will maybe

00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:30,850
automatically choose the variant that

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:34,179
you like based on you know type and then

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,549
you can and then if you want to be more

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:39,070
strict about it you can be explicit so

00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:41,200
that's the library I started it

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,880
basically to win an argument I'm hoping

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,779
that I've maybe won you over a little

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,580
bit you can find it on github you can

00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,080
include in your library and I'd love to

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,220
see some pull requests or some issues or

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:58,210
just people tell me I'm wrong Thanks

00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:03,290
[Applause]

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:05,000
a quick request Brett cannon if you're

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:08,000
if you're in the room if you could meet

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,940
me over there if you have direct contact

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,310
with Brett cannon and you could ping

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:18,500
Brett cannon and tell him to meet me

00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:21,890
over there that'd be fantastic all right

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:25,490
and to finish up I know that you love

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,650
PyCon and you want more pie cons so this

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,410
is going to be a series of promoting

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,210
local regional pie cons and they have at

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,510
most a minute unless they're presenting

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:40,070
more than one which a couple of you are

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:42,680
but yeah right hello if you ever wanted

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,390
to visit Prague Czech Republic now is

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,760
your chance in less than a month we're

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,400
having Pike on cset we have an amazing

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,520
venue as anyone who went last year can

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,190
tell you we have great keynotes talks

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,140
workshops a great community not as many

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,880
people as here which is also nice I

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:03,410
think so

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,300
yeah come it's in June 1st to 3rd I'm

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,640
also supposed to say something about

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,970
Pike on Taiwan so if you are not in

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:15,290
Europe you can go to Python Taiwan which

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,640
is also beginning of June the person who

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,150
was supposed to present this is

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:28,130
unfortunately sick so go to Pike on TW

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:30,380
to read about the details hello

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,850
everybody my name is Eric just a show of

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,820
hands here how many people use the

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,220
scientific computing Python stack yes

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,370

00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,320
know the world doesn't end at the

00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,760
equator there is a whole other half of

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,860
the world down here and we have our own

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,530
Python conferences PyCon Australia is

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,630
coming up August 24th to the 26th we

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,400

education and Internet of Things

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,040
followed by two days of confiture as a

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,710
general track followed by two days of

Sunday voice there there there I mean I

you want it about um about a man who's

00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:07,520
really into tractors they're just um

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,590
they're just a person who really likes

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,390
tractors and they have a big collection

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,160
of model tractors at home and they have

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:17,870
subscription to agricultural magazines

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,520
and they kind of have big posters or

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,280
tractors in their house and just like

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,780
tractors is their big thing and if you'd

00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,970
like to hear the rest of the story I'm

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:30,830
available anytime please take it away

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:33,320
for an actual lightning talk hello good

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:36,440
morning PyCon it's a pleasure to be here

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,050
my name is rod Sandra at currently I

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,940
work for working company in New York but

00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,790
since Nicole just presented to you

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,650
Python Brasil let me speak you just a

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:48,050
little bit about Python Brasil and then

00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:51,410
the actual lightning talk and it all

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:54,140
fits within the five minutes so the

00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,240
reason I'm here is that back in 2001 I

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,130
did a tiny little contribution to the

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,470
Python community which was translating

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,110
Guido's van rossum tutorial to the

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:06,710
Portuguese language so my name shows up

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:09,740
into the official site for Python org

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:12,590
and that the reason that was important

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,360
because Portuguese is kind of relevant

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,970
in the world it's not as big as English

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:21,950
it's not as big as Chinese but it's

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:24,800
there so in 2005 after talking to Alan

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:27,590
Runyon during the international forum of

00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,570
free software in 2004 he said more big

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,320
enough to make a conference so I decided

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:35,840
to do it and I created the first

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,550
conference to gather up all the panel

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,930
community in Brazil in 2005 who are

00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:44,270
about 200 people and then after that for

00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:47,390
13 years without failure we are hosting

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:51,500
a national Python conference and all of

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:53,990
them had international speakers in 2007

00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,990
we decided that we needed some supports

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,780
to organize those conferences so we

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:02,240
created the Brazilian Python Association

00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,340
which was a nonprofit organization like

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,830
a subordinate branch of the Python

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,770
Software Foundation to make sure that we

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:13,220
do those conferences every year and do

00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:16,159
it right so this is just one picture of

00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:19,310
the conference people gather around on

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,679
the beach in this year Fernando pair is

00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,139
the creator of Jupiter notebooks in the

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,320
ipython project was there amongst that

00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:30,349
crowd and this is what it looked like in

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,840
2017 I don't have a picture for this

00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:35,230
year but you are all invited to be there

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,310
next year like Nicole just told you and

00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:41,750
so we still have two minutes to spare

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:44,500
okay so in that case we'll leave this

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:50,920
for next year thank you so much

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:53,080
[Applause]

00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,050
so this person is really excited about

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,760
tractors as I said and one day this big

00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,260
Agricultural Fair comes to town and

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,940
there's gonna be a big exhibition of

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,710
tractors and they're really excited to

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,000
go to it but not as excited as I'm saw

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:08,920
you all are to hear this lightning talk

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,820
take it right sir all right hi my name

00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,220
is Michel Rocard

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,830
I am a local to Cleveland Ohio and I

00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,380
wanted to tell you about I would

00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,550
encourage you to do things like start

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,350
your own business and write your own

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,390
software because that's exactly what I

00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:26,730
did and it was actually a success which

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:30,100
is a rare thing so in 2013 I started a

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:32,920
Python project as a product that I

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,960
worked on with my mom we started selling

00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,300
it we were we sold over a million

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,750
dollars worth of the software last year

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:43,720
and then we ended up selling it we end

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:46,300
up solving the companies this year so I

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,160
want to encourage everybody that if you

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,930
have an idea to build a Pete a product

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,510
and go out there and sell it and make

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,150
actual startup in a company you can do

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:57,480
it I'm just a local guy I did it and it

00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:04,480
was a very exciting fun challenging time

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:07,810
but I did it and it worked so so the

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,450
company was the company was it was

00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,770
called noggin LLC the product was HR

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,480
tutor and we just got bought by a

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,480
company called ascend learning so

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,339
so he's been what he's been he's been

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,500
waiting his whole life really for this

00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:26,480
agricultural exhibition to come around

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,369
because he knows that there's gonna be

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,990
amazing tractors of this thing like some

00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:32,510
of his favorite like old tractors new

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,609
tractors but especially this amazing

00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,170
John Deere model so he gets his ticket

00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,570
way ahead of time on the earlybird

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,220
scheme and then he's counting down the

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,810
days crossing off things in his calendar

00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,890
it's a tractor themed calendar and

00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,390
eventually the big day is here he's been

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,880
camping out that morning and he's the

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,200
first person in line and he gets into

00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,790
the conference center like that he's the

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,680
actual post person in there he runs in

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,480
the whole thing is deserted and he

00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,980
actually sort of runs past all the quite

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,470
exciting old tractors and exhibits

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,460
because he knows there's one massive new

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,810
John Deere tractor that he wants to see

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,950
he gets up to it's in the mists of the

00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,960
main room of the hall is this just

00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,480
gigantic thing it's it's the size of a

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,310
mining truck and the wheels are higher

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,680
than he is and he's just looking at it

00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,329
and share all that this is the absolute

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,890
perfection of tractor technology as far

00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:23,119
as he's concerned and as he's there and

00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,609
there's not kind of really anyone around

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,020
he's there he's overwhelmed and he just

00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:28,970
goes well I know you're not supposed to

00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,260
do this but kind of leans over the

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,690
velvet rope and he just wants to touch

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:37,400
it you know so he just touches it and

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:39,140
it's a little shiver well okay it's not

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,540
really anyone here and he's embolden by

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,390
the fact he's broken a little rule so he

00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,790
just gently kind of steps over the line

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:49,760
and gets a little closer to the tractor

00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:53,470
and feels the kind of door and are you

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,470
ready to go go

00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,170
hi I'm Michael Sullivan I'm going to

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,170
talk quickly about a lightning fast type

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,960
checking with my PI so I'm one of the my

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,300
PI core developers and I'm just gonna so

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,119
if you're not familiar with that scroll

00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,860
to many slides I'm sorry okay so my PI

00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:14,830
is an optional static type checking for

00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,140
Python it uses a pep for 84 annotations

00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,490
and lets you you know annotate your code

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,860
so here's the Fibonacci function that

00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,060
takes an integer and returns iterator of

00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,070
n so I'm not going to go too much into

00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,290
the syntax but that's what it looks like

00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:30,250
that's Python 3 it also supports Python

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,570
2 using type comments it you know if you

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,910
do something wrong it'll give you type

00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,740
errors if you call the function the

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,280
method eggs on a string it'll give you

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,050
an error it also will enforce that when

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,760
you expect some object you're not just

00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,160
passing a none

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,810
you can mix typed and untyped code to

00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,210
allow you to gradually migrate your code

00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:52,000
bases so at Dropbox we have a lot of

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,400
code and we've gotten to the point where

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,230
about 25 percent of its my PI annotated

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,260
and doing more but it it provides a

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:03,609
gradual migration path we recently had a

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,650
big release my PI o dot 600 and the the

00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:07,570
biggest news and that releases that we

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,600
added a new feature called the my PI

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,550
demon and what the my demon does is it

00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,460
sort of runs in the background checking

00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,230
your code and when a function changes it

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,930
only rechecks functions that depend on

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,820
it so here we have a function foo and

00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,560
it's getting called from another module

00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:27,400
and if we change it to return a string

00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:30,130
instead that might break some code but

00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,320
my PI demon knows that the only thing it

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,030
needs to retype check is this egg's

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,480
function that calls it the rest of the

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,550
code doesn't need to be checked because

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,900
nothing's changed that it cares about

00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,930
the big upshot of this is that it makes

00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,670
everything wicked fast at Dropbox we

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,830
have over a million lines of type

00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:52,990
annotated Python in our main repository

00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:55,270
and the p75 the 75% of type checks that

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,320
our engineers do take less than five

00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:02,020
seconds so just since that's a new

00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,220
feature I think it's a good thing for

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,220
everyone to check out thank you

00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:13,670
so so once he's once he's kind of timed

00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,679
over the velvet rope anyway and he's

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,150
touched the door he can't really help

00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,999
himself and say says I'll check the door

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,769
handle and it's it's open so he goes

00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,509
okay come on this is the most amazing

00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,489
tractor I've ever seen in my life

00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:27,650
I've got to climb up and so he just

00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:29,209
quickly runs up the little steps and

00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,769
jumps into the cabin and he sits down on

00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:35,089
this tractor and it's the most amazing

00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:36,799
feeling he's ever had he's massively

00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:38,719
high art there's this amazing control

00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:41,119
panel in front of them and he just loves

00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:44,689
tractors obviously so he just gets this

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,949
rush and and then he notices that the

00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:50,509
key is in the ignition and by this stage

00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,769
he's thrown all caution to the wind he's

00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:52,640
like I'll forget it I just want a heavy

00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:54,799
engine I just

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,619
they turns the ignition on and this huge

00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:59,900
amazing Rumble comes out and sense the

00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:01,969
power is overwhelming and but not as

00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,049
overwhelming as how amazing the next

00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:05,049
lightning talk is gonna be

00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,500
would you like a mic yeah sorry well

00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:13,329
they're setting up I have a two-minute

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,680
lighting talk for everybody hi my name

00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,779
is Hill Elaine I have a question for all

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,789
of you who's had to an interview use a

00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:20,049
linked list write a link this is part of

00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:21,520
interview quick raise of hands I can't

00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:23,760
see any of you because it's to write out

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,960
why do we have to ask linked lists in

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,880
1992 the main language everybody used

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,799
was C and in C you don't have

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,180
higher-order data structures so if want

00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:33,460
to do literally anything you have to

00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,200
write a linked list therefore it was not

00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,750
a question of do you know algorithms but

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,099
have you program C before starting 1995

00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,390
the number of programmers exploded

00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:42,339
everybody was trying to use older

00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,140
questions and it got repurposed when

00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:46,329
people started using Java and Python etc

00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,720
as an algorithms question in other words

00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:48,720
it's garbage

00:41:49,080 --> 00:42:00,389
[Applause]

00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:03,059
everyone my name is Moshe sadqa' and I

00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:05,279
want to talk to you about middle field

00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:09,209
which is a custom generic developer tool

00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:10,529
and he started because I was changing

00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:12,419
companies and each time I had to like

00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:13,799
build a new tool for developers and I

00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:17,459
was building the same things over and

00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:19,109
over again so the way it's custom but

00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:20,669
generic is that the only built-in

00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:22,649
command it has is to build a new

00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:24,449
executable so if you just wanted to a

00:42:22,649 --> 00:42:26,549
sec wait a sec I don't know how to run

00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:29,069
echo but it has a command called self

00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:30,749
build and if use a plug-in that is like

00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:33,149
very silly but I wrote that's called

00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,829
echo then suddenly it knows how to echo

00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,689
right so if you have custom commands you

00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,159
can just add it to middlefield and then

00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:40,919
you upload the pecs to whatever internal

00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:44,069
place you want again to an RT factory or

00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:46,289
maybe even your stock channel Y thing a

00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:47,759
plug-in is really easy that's pretty

00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:49,529
much all you need to do in set of tools

00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:52,739
you need to make sure that you register

00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:54,659
it and you add you can own dependencies

00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,489
and you can add an actual command this

00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:59,939
is the echo command it just means the

00:42:56,489 --> 00:43:01,949
arguments because it's silly so if you

00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:04,409
think that is awesome you can write a

00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:05,969
plug-in you can make it eternal if it's

00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:07,799
really custom sync or you can put it on

00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:10,709
github if it's useful for other people

00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:12,689
you can distribute it internally and if

00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:14,339
you are interested at all in this thing

00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:15,869
and like you're also building tools for

00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:18,979
developers and you're wondering how we

00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:22,649
can make it nicer please talk to me I'm

00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:24,569
that commercial gmail.com or you can go

00:43:22,649 --> 00:43:26,249
to my website copper diesel.com this has

00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,049
all the links to me so you can find me

00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:30,289
everywhere on the Internet thank you

00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:30,289
very much

00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:45,609
all right thank you let's give another

00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:48,009
hand all the Lightning speakers that

00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:49,509
concludes all the leggy talks for PyCon

00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:50,739
so if you want to give a lightning talk

00:43:49,509 --> 00:43:54,819
then you have to wait till next year

00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:57,940
sorry what

00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:59,759
yeah we're getting to that I'll just

00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,369
I'll just let you finish go for it I

00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:06,339
don't know if you really I mean you know

00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:08,109
yeah there we go so he's turned on the

00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,609
engine he's feeling this sheer feeling

00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:11,319
of rush of power in this gigantic

00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:13,480
chapter and he just can't help himself

00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:15,489
by this point he puts his pedal their

00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,739
foot on down on the pedal he drives the

00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:19,119
tractor off of its plinth down through

00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,160
the brave it rose and just starts

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,529
crashing through all of the like sort of

00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,299
prefabricated walls of the Exhibition

00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:27,549
Centre and just goes on a rampage with

00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:29,170
this tractor and like so you know the

00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:30,940
police are called and they eventually

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,319
pull him down and they drag him out of

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,420
this tractor and they take him away and

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,369
he gets put to jail and he has to pay a

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,319
huge fine and after all this he like

00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:40,720
kind of gets home and he goes gosh I

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,380
think I've let this good too far I think

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,489
maybe that my tractor obsession as as

00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,109
taking me to places I don't want to be

00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:48,549
so he just goes you know done with

00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:50,109
tractors and he takes down all this

00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:52,029
tractor posters from the wall he takes

00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:53,799
all his tractor magazines canceled

00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:55,480
subscriptions takes all his model

00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:56,890
tractors all his Lego tractors he puts

00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,410
them in a big file in the back of his

00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,420
house he makes a huge bonfire sets fast

00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,549
a lot of them he gets rid of all kind of

00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,579
vestiges of tractors from his entire

00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:09,489
life and once he's done that it takes a

00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:13,930
really deep breath he goes half that's

00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:15,009
better so he goes to the pub and he goes

00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,989
in there and the pub is kind of empty

00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:18,130
and there's a weird smell and he goes

00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:19,480
the barman what's going on why is it

00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,279
emptying is while everyone's kind of put

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,559
off by the weird smell and he goes you

00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,759
know I think we can help you with that

00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,099
and sort of walks around the pub slowly

00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:28,329
and he goes - he's sniffing and he goes

00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,720
to where the smell is strongest and he

00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,720
goes like this

00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:39,640
and he walks outside he goes and he goes

00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:44,020
back in the pub and he goes back to the

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,170
sort of central spirit and he walks back

00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:55,810
outside and he goes he does this a few

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:56,230
more times and gradually as he's doing

00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,840
this

00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,880
the smell slowly disappears and the

00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:10,800
barman toast to me is that's amazing how

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:18,700
do you do that and he said well I'm an

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:20,800
extractor fan a huge round of applause

00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,480
for our conference chair man is totally

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,950
dude in the third thank you very much I

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,690
was hairy thank you to all the lightning

00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,170
talk speakers Thank You PyCon see you

00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:32,690
next year

00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:32,690
[Applause]

00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:49,560
welcome to the third day of talks here

00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,200
at PyCon 2018 the last day of talks here

00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:55,440
at PyCon 2018 I want to give a huge

00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,660
thanks to Lynne and Harry and all the

00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,850
lightning talk participants this year

00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,620
particularly for helping us fill the

00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,320
time to get to right now so a big round

00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:12,960
of applause for all the lightning talk

00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:15,300
participants in the lead-up to PyCon

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,270
2018 you may have heard from locals

00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,120
about the mercurial or curious weather

00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,490
here it shifts very quickly from one

00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,560
thing to another and you may have seen

00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:27,510
that during your time here so I want to

00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,760
give a huge shout out to about 30 people

00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,100
who woke up this morning and looked out

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,810
the window at pouring down rain and

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,830
thunder and lightning and still walk

00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:39,180
down to participate in the 5k fun run

00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:42,680
thank you that everybody applauded the

00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,680
fact that they were prepared to do that

00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,890
we're really sorry that didn't work out

00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:53,130
but it didn't seem safe to run with

00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:56,040
lightning bolts if you haven't picked up

00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:59,340
your 5k Fun Run t-shirt please go do so

00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,960
they'll be around all day today speaking

00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:04,350
of today happy Mother's Day here in the

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,780
US we have prepared two things for

00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,280
Mother's Day here at the conference one

00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,710
is in room 10 today there will be no

00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,630
open spaces we want to use that room as

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,370
a place where you can go to make a call

00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,230
home to your loved ones if they can't be

00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,910
here with you without having to step too

00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,320
far away from the conference so check

00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,090
that out and additionally there'll be a

00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,670
photo booth outside of registration

00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:25,530
where you can take photo with PyCon

00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,240
themed things and send it back to your

00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,000
loved ones as well so check those out

00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,270
they'll be open from 10:00 until the

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,160
closing keynote today we have the job

00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,660
fair and poster session in the expo hall

00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,480
where the booths were yesterday so go

00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:41,490
check those out the poster session and

00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,620
job fair will run this morning and then

00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:45,360
lunch and then we have talks in the

00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,550
afternoon before we come back here to

00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,230
conclude with our closing keynote

00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,090
additionally the open spaces will be

00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,420
running all day so keep checking the

00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,120
bore

00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:57,450
out near registration and that's what we

00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:59,250
got going on today our keynote this

00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:02,220
morning is Brett cannon brett has

00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,800
attended every PyCon by its name and

00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,650
it's been a core developer for 15 years

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,470
Brett's currently core Python developer

00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,240
that is Gretz currently a principal

00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:15,000
software developer on the Python tools

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,560
team at Microsoft as a developer lead on

00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,480
the Python extension for Visual Studio

00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,280
code something Brett and I have in

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,650
common is we probably both miss our cats

00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,200
immensely at this point so without

00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:31,510
further ado here's Brett cannon

00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:34,040
[Applause]

00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,810
well good morning everyone thanks for

00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,880
having me I have to admit when Ernest

00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:39,650
asked me to do this I got to cross

00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,910
something off my lifetime bucket list so

00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,520
I really appreciate that Ernest thank

00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,960
you very much for helping with that

00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,040
so before I start talking about setting

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,260
expectations for open source

00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,060
participation slight warning I get a

00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,350
little emotional giving this talk I'm

00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,840
going to try to keep the language clean

00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:57,020
if I slip up a little bit I apologize to

00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,540
the younger members of the audience but

00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,040
first I want to cover kind of my bona

00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,740
fides of why I'm up here giving this

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,330
talk so as Ernest mentioned I am the dev

00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,160
lead on the Python extension for Visual

00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,770
Studio code if you don't happen to know

00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,270
what v/s code is it's Microsoft's

00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,130
cross-platform open-source code editor

00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:16,070
which I know shocks some people with the

00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:18,470
first two phrases in that sentence it

00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,790
actually is and Python thinks all of you

00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,920
is the fastest-growing language on the

00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,330
tool but the reason I mention it is

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,310
originally it was an open source project

00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,930
from the community by dawn j-money

00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:34,490
who's here attending his first bike on

00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:36,320
us so we saw Don's work we loved it we

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,720
had he said do you want to come work on

00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,490
the extension full-time he said sure he

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,510
moved out to Redmond and we've been

00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:46,910
working on that since September so I now

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:48,350
that it's gone from what I would call

00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,840
community open source where basically

00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,670
it's fully run by external contributors

00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,030
who put in their volunteer time I now

00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,290
call it what I call it corporate open

00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,700
source basically if all the external

00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:01,400
contributors went away there's at least

00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:04,610
a backstop by a company making sure that

00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,920
the project keeps moving forward I saw

00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:10,760
earnest also mention I'm core developer

00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,620
I've been doing that since April 2003 I

00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,360
actually got my commit bit about two

00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:17,000
weeks after the very first PyCon back in

00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,080
DC and once they and I would consider

00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,820
this community open source because

00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,040
basically if everyone who volunteered on

00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:25,130
Python disappeared the project would

00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,840
probably collapse within a month I've

00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,090
also been lucky enough to distribute to

00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,590
over 80 open source projects now if you

00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:32,510
saw Mary I just talked the other day I

00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:35,630
will also admit most of those or fixing

00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,770
typos but it has exposed me to a lot of

00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,890
different development processes

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:43,610
so I've led corporate open source I've

00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:44,720
lived I've managed committee open source

00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,640
and I've just been a

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,040
overall so I've been like enough to have

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,080
quite a broad range of exposure to open

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,340
sources overall

00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,930
and so it's led to me asking the

00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,599
question of like what is the purpose of

00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:58,640
an open source project in community now

00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,780
for me a project in community for open

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,820
source basically means you've gotten at

00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,500
least one external contribution from

00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,830
someone else that's basically when your

00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,510
community becomes too and before that

00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,740
it's kind of a code dump but when you

00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,190
start actually have to interact with the

00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,349
public

00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,000
that makes it open-source and in general

00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:15,590
this is also we can all collaborate

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,970
together as a group to maintain the

00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,130
project and honestly to also have fun

00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,780
because we want to keep the project

00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,830
going for various reasons but you want

00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,359
to enjoy yourself while you do it

00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,550
because if you're doing it just to

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,750
maintain it and it's horrible you're not

00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,910
gonna want to keep doing it and that's

00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:30,710
how people just want draw up projects

00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,020
walk away quit jobs if that's what

00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:35,540
you're paid to do etc now if you're just

00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,130
having fun well I've just got a bit rot

00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,840
and then you're gonna stop having fun as

00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:42,859
well so it's a real balancing act

00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:44,390
between the two and then the question

00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:46,119
becomes alright so you find this balance

00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:48,290
how do you sustain it going long-term

00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:49,490
we've been like enough with Python avid

00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,220
around for 28 years

00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:53,839
thanks to Guido and it's a balancing act

00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,060
between attracting new people will also

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,599
keep you around the current people there

00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:01,960
is a certain level of attrition amongst

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:05,980
contributors to our project whether it's

00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:08,260
just having children getting bored

00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,820
burnout which I'll talk about more later

00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,770
unfortunate people pass away basically

00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,050
just the original people who come came

00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,910
around a project will slowly trickle

00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:19,280
down so you have to figure out ways to

00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:21,080
bring in new people to keep it going and

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,180
for projects such as Python they could

00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,460
be a little tricky because over 28 years

00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,710
there's a lot of current processes that

00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,190
worked well 5-10 years ago that don't

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,810
miss a gel but the way things work today

00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:35,089
but the trick is there are still people

00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:38,930
around who's been contributing myself 5

00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:40,220
10 15 years ago and you have to make

00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,599
sure that they stay comfortable because

00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,740
you also want to learn all that internal

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,710
laws that they've built around the

00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,720
project so if some key people dropped

00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,070
away who have all the knowledge of how

00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,599
the dictionary implementation works

00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:52,369
you're gonna have you're gonna be a

00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,540
tough spot so it's a real tricky

00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:55,580
balancing act of how do you keep people

00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,600
coming in while keeping the people who

00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,010
are already around around

00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,060
so in case you haven't noticed it's

00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:04,560
really hard to run open source projects

00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,750
so really what's the goal here the goal

00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,340
overall is to work together to set us a

00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,350
set of reasonable expectations so that

00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,300
open source works for everybody right

00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:14,190
how to make it fun how do we maintain

00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,130
the project and how do we attract new

00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:18,450
people or retain the current people and

00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,800
the key thing here I want anyone to

00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,830
think about what we're doing this is

00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,180
most people are either volunteers or if

00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,250
they're lucky enough being paid by

00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,870
someone probably other than you to

00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,950
maintain this so we really need to work

00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,780
together to build a symbiotic

00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,460
relationship where open-source is

00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:36,270
actually sustainable and usable and

00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:37,920
workable by everybody and this is where

00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,590
it gets a little emotional

00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,970
we're not exactly succeeding at this

00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:46,350
goal all the time

00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:48,240
Corie Benfield who created the HTTP HTTP

00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:52,160
to implementation for python called

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:55,200
hyper h2 was is a maintainer on requests

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:57,660
as a maintainer on your lip 3 and

00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,150
basically when the street was taken in

00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,280
November 2016 was an extremely critical

00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:04,800
person in our networking stack as a

00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,750
community tweeted out quote here's a bit

00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,580
of real talk for people I think work in

00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:11,280
open source software has been me more

00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,260
bitter and short-tempered end quote and

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,340
that's kind of a tough place to put

00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:20,090
quarry because if quarry has a partner

00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,110
and if his partner came to him and said

00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,300
open sources made you a very bitter

00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:26,760
person and for tempered it's either me

00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,780
or open source I would hope quarry would

00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,400
choose his partner and actually he I

00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,780
think he has because he's actually not

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,400
here this year because he needs enough

00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,170
vacation time to go on his honeymoon

00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,110
later this year and to see family at

00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:41,910
Christmas so good for him

00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,350
but it really sucks that we have to put

00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,870
core in this position where potentially

00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:47,250
he might be asked that like it's kind of

00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,620
sad that I actually have to worry about

00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,810
that that quarry might actually have his

00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,960
spouse ask him please don't do

00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:56,760
open-source it's made you a worse person

00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,910
and in my personal experience this has

00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,310
actually happened in 29 October I

00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:05,430
actually take a month off and basically

00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:07,080
detox from open source due to three

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,200
consecutive months of bad interactions

00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,109
from the community and it was really

00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,349
tough

00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:18,089
and I did it and I came back and I

00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:20,619
really thought about what happened and

00:56:18,089 --> 00:56:22,900
this basically this is what this talk is

00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:24,190
all about is how do we work together to

00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,079
make sure that people are not put in the

00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,969
position here where spouses are having

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,519
to talk to the their significant others

00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:31,390
doing open source and say I really can't

00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:33,069
have you do the same work you're not

00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:35,440
it's not coming out the way you want and

00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:36,640
this is not by the way just 2016 happen

00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,809
to be a key here just cuz there were a

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,719
lot of burnout in the community that

00:56:37,809 --> 00:56:42,729
year I actually still have to take off

00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,920
one week one day every weekend to make

00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:49,299
sure that I don't have my whole weekend

00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,829
ruined based on one bad email so the

00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:53,440
problem is people tend to forget two key

00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:55,109
things we're doing open source and at

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,729
least interacting with it

00:56:55,109 --> 00:57:00,160
one thing is open source has a cost I

00:56:57,729 --> 00:57:02,680
know we all like to elude the fact that

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,619
it's free as in beer on top is just free

00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,630
as in Libre and all that but there's

00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:10,569
still time effort and emotional output

00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:13,390
in all this right like if I do open

00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:14,619
source in my spare time that's time away

00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:17,949
from my cat which other hey I'm missing

00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:19,690
so you were right earnest it's time away

00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:21,039
from my wife it's time away from my

00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:23,140
family it's time away from my friends

00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,339
right so like if you send me a pull

00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,380
request or send me a bug report you're

00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:28,690
basically asking hey if you can take a

00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:31,509
time away from your loved ones could you

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,979
please do something about this right and

00:57:31,509 --> 00:57:35,259
something we just think about and it's

00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:37,930
understandable right it's it's just an

00:57:35,259 --> 00:57:40,150
issue tracker and github that's it but

00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,549
remember like every email you send the

00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,589
Python dev or Python ideas I'm I'm

00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:46,390
reading and that's gonna be a few

00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:49,029
seconds in my life well to play that

00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:50,319
across a hundred a thousand emails if

00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:55,779
you're following the five somebody to

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:57,069
discussion time in your life so it's

00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:59,160
something we just don't think about but

00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:02,619
it's probably something we need to that

00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,789
there is cost here it might be free and

00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:05,739
which is awesome and great that we can

00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:07,449
do this and give it away but there is

00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:10,420
still something being taken from

00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:12,489
somewhere else and I only have so much

00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,709
time on this planet and I tried to use

00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:17,469
it wisely but it can be tough sometimes

00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:19,509
based on how interactions happen this

00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:21,190
can be in the community through

00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:23,440
open-source to continue to make the

00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,670
decision to take that precious time and

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,079
spend out an open-source there just

00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:31,809
you know what skirt I'm gonna go for a

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:33,250
hike and just not fix that bug today so

00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:34,630
this led me to kind of think that

00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:38,440
officer should be kind of basically a

00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:39,819
series of unsolicited kindnesses wait

00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,430
you could say this is basically it's a

00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:44,170
series of gifts that people give you

00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:47,500
that you didn't necessarily ask for and

00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:50,289
I'll explain why it's didn't ask for in

00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,480
a second but basically if we just viewed

00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:54,490
all this in a more nice or positive

00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,289
framework of everyone's just trying to

00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,819
help everyone else out and we always

00:58:56,289 --> 00:59:00,069
realize that we're just doing it

00:58:57,819 --> 00:59:02,260
kindness for someone I think we do a lot

00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:04,450
better in terms of make sure no one

00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,880
feels like they're being abused or used

00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:09,010
or just misunderstood and they just

00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,579
leave to a much better interaction

00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:14,380
across the board so I'm gonna go through

00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:16,299
some tickle scenarios here discussing

00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,609
kind of what this means in terms of this

00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:21,819
concept of kindnesses to others if you

00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:24,099
need to picture something that you can

00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:25,750
imagine this is between Stewart Stewart

00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:28,779
and Brett Stewart being a contributor

00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:29,890
and me being a maintainer this is

00:59:28,779 --> 00:59:33,369
actually Stewart Williams who by the way

00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:34,660
is in the front row over there for him

00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,240
Winnipeg Manitoba who gave me the idea

00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:40,180
of having the arrows on here to help get

00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,710
the point across to who's helping who so

00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:43,869
using an open-source right you think

00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:46,539
this is probably one of the more simple

00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:48,190
things right where I'm doing a favor for

00:59:46,539 --> 00:59:51,460
Stewart by doing this open source and

00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:53,769
just giving it away for free well you

00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,940
think so but it can also be some sort of

00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:56,230
like someone leave a pamphlet out on

00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,819
something you find offensive and

00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,470
actually for the longest time I just

00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:00,730
like yeah I couldn't really come up with

00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:03,039
a good example of where this goes bad

01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:05,440
until unfortunately about a week ago

01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,690
we're a very big open source project had

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,920
a joke that was bad and they removed it

01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:12,160
and there was this huge hoopla in the

01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,119
community about the joke I'm sure some

01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,640
of you know what I'm talking about and

01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:18,490
turned out to name names and some people

01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,410
found that joke offensive and it really

01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,690
gets the point across that even in your

01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:24,730
documentation introducing a project to

01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:26,710
somebody actually matters and how you

01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:28,299
work with people you need to make sure

01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,250
that we're trying to be inclusive and

01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:31,930
understanding of everyone because it

01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,250
still even affects people even if you're

01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,750
not just like pushing in people's faces

01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:39,029
because people won't just come across it

01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:39,029
and read it and it will affect them

01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:45,810
the next usual step in open source to

01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:47,880
people providing feedback you can kind

01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:50,370
of equate this two family members coin

01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,650
you stupid I'm hopefully not everyone

01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:55,830
has had to experience this it's really

01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:58,410
rough when someone says you're dumb the

01:00:55,830 --> 01:01:01,290
example I give here is once hacker news

01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:03,600
had a very uploaded article and I should

01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,910
be reading hacker news but it is what it

01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,380
is and one of the things that I got

01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:10,560
uploaded was someone's complaints about

01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,420
Python now sometimes these blog post

01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,190
saying like I love Python but there's

01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,440
this weird wart blah blah blah

01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,370
our reasonably written and I read them

01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,540
to try to see if there's something we

01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,010
could actually fix this I've actually

01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,260
filed bug reports and gotten some things

01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:24,030
fixed based on those blog posts so I

01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,220
read it and the authors started off

01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:29,130
saying like oh I love I like Python it's

01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,620
good blah blah blah blah and then a huge

01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,570
list of this is stupid that's dumb why

01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:35,760
the hell did they do this it's etcetera

01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:38,000
etcetera now the problem is is while I'm

01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,950
reading this I'm going that's my fault

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,760
that's a friend's fault that's another

01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,530
friend's fault

01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,850
that's not even reasonable because

01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,860
that's where backwards compatibility was

01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:48,810
something from 1993 because remember

01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,130
breath owns 28 years old and predates

01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:54,030
Unicode it's a tarts header dinner and

01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,860
if you actually read the hacker news

01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:59,700
thread which was actually very positive

01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:01,620
and nice to see the author said well

01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,970
look I said it was I liked it it was

01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,110
like well that doesn't give you excuse

01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:06,450
cuz you forget that there are actually

01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,790
people behind that project right you

01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,690
might be kind a feature stupid but by

01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,850
calling that features do but you're

01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,050
basically calling me stupid right like I

01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:16,140
put a lot of time and effort into

01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:17,940
something and put my personal time into

01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:20,010
it right once again away from my family

01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,880
and friends and you just base it Walt

01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:26,790
scrap it's like then why am i doing it

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,260
so it can be really tough and I pointed

01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,760
out to the author I mean it's quote the

01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,230
social network the internist written in

01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,570
pencils written in ink so that block was

01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,850
gonna be around forever a climb me and

01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,950
my personal time stupid and wasted so

01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:40,290
it's just really frustrating when people

01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,760
do this and why it's I'm not saying you

01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,410
can't criticize right there's always a

01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,030
way to phrase things where you just say

01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:47,910
hey I don't understand why this is the

01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:49,290
way it is and you could always ask by

01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,640
the way you could usually ask people why

01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,330
like if you came to Python to have a

01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,730
nest

01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:55,230
why is it done this way we'd be happy to

01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:57,600
explain to you a lot of it's honestly

01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:00,060
backwards compatibility or what have you

01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:03,690
and we all appreciate the compatibility

01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:05,460
we do so usually it's it was like that

01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:07,980
way 95 and we just want to break your

01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:11,460
code unnecessarily so sorry it's a

01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:13,740
little weird but there's always a way to

01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,050
phrase things such that you can still

01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:18,330
have a critical question without being

01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:19,560
mean about it because as I said there's

01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:23,970
always a person behind that piece of

01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:26,310
code now submitting a contribution this

01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,870
can also get a little sticky I like to

01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:31,610
say that it's like someone who tries to

01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,610
give you a puppy you didn't ask for it

01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:35,940
you might view this puppy that's just

01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,560
cute adorable things say hey look toast

01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,930
you want this cute puppy and I'm looking

01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:44,340
at that as 10 years of pooping and

01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:45,560
feeding and taking for walks because you

01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:49,230
have to really think about this way

01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:51,150
let's say you give me APR okay I'm going

01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,800
to review it and let's say I accept it

01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:56,190
right off the bat no no looping around

01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,920
and cheeses everything that code is now

01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:01,770
on my head it's maintained for probably

01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,190
at least a decade right

01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:07,350
remember Python is 28 years old old

01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:08,730
predates unicode and i don't think

01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:10,440
anyone in this room would like it to

01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,480
disappear tomorrow so hopefully we're

01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,150
gonna have another 28 years at least of

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,800
awesome times at PyCon which means i

01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:20,310
have to worry about that code lasting

01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:21,840
until Pike on 28 years from now so

01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:24,240
there's a lot of having to really think

01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:26,910
about this stuff in terms of okay if I

01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,200
take this am I going to break someone's

01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:30,720
code because by the way there's like

01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,130
over seven million of us churches are

01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,660
I'm gonna break someone's code now are

01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:36,390
they gonna be really upset that I broke

01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:38,760
their code is it gonna be reasonable I

01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:41,880
pretentiously just made a ton of books

01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,560
printed on dead trees obsolete because

01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,970
of this change I mean it's really

01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,130
mind-blowing we started thinking about

01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:50,940
the ramifications so this is why

01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:53,540
sometimes we have to say sorry and I'll

01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:56,330
talk about that in the next slide the

01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:58,770
other way this can kind of go wrong is

01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:01,200
sometimes people will say here's a PR

01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:03,060
because this is really broken or this is

01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,310
really wrong once again negativity

01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,930
that's not necessary basically you don't

01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:09,060
to tell me that you're fixing my mess

01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,720
you could just say I'm helping out as

01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,360
best I can

01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,710
because I think I can improve this right

01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,140
once again all this stuff can be phrased

01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,550
in a positive place without being

01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:21,660
negative outwardly negative towards

01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:23,910
anybody now I've seen when people submit

01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,890
something we need to also give back in a

01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:27,240
positive light right so when you give me

01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:28,620
the kindness to give me a PR I should at

01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,470
least give you the kindness of saying

01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:33,150
thank you right instead of saying hey

01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:34,890
you're doing it wrong what what the

01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:36,720
heck's going on you that's not right

01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:40,110
forget it

01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:43,920
like I once submitted I don't know about

01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:47,280
six or ten spelling mistake PRS for

01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,980
projects documentation right no big deal

01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,000
real quick it was in the github so I was

01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,490
able just to click that little pencil

01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,410
whip it out do it kept writing find

01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:57,270
another one do it keep doing it my first

01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:00,930
response don't you know you can just

01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:02,490
send one PR it's like well yeah but I'm

01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:04,290
ringing it through the through github

01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:06,720
it's faster just click the pencil and

01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:08,400
just do it and I thought you just liked

01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,710
it did you miss the crystals really

01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,930
necessary cuz you could just ignore the

01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:14,790
pr's it'd be fine too but I mean really

01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,870
just point out like come on newbie what

01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,150
the hell are you doing is just

01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:20,370
unnecessary

01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:22,710
um the other problem is this when you

01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:24,960
give feedback especially when you say

01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:28,770
I'm sorry no I can't take this because I

01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,720
don't think breaking at least a hundred

01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:32,670
thousand people's worth of code is worth

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,320
the change you're asking for some people

01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:36,180
can take that personally and it's never

01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:39,360
meant to be personal it just feels like

01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:42,450
it so it could be like why don't you

01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:44,400
love me why won't you take this I for

01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:47,070
instance when I had my burnout back in

01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,020
2016 one of the reasons that happened

01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,400
and I should preface this with the

01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:54,900
person in the story has apologized

01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,830
subsequently he said yeah I'm mad at you

01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,760
because you're preventing me from

01:06:55,830 --> 01:07:01,500
contributing it's like well I'm sorry it

01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,910
wasn't meant to really be a blocker for

01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,400
you it's just I have to also realize

01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:07,470
that I have my own obligations to the

01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,910
project and the 7 million users the

01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:12,150
Python to make sure that I keep it in

01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:17,010
perspective so I'm sorry but no I can't

01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:18,480
this so just it's really tricky and then

01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,200
finally maintaining could be like

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,440
arguing with just

01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:26,070
Li's about politics we should all know

01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:28,980
better but we don't always I've actually

01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:31,530
almost come to tears arguing with the

01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,119
core developer following PyCon people

01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:35,430
ask are you actually still talking to

01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:38,070
them I mean stuff can get fairly heated

01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:40,050
because we all care so much and we don't

01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:43,560
take the time to step back from the eat

01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:46,410
from the email client and just go okay

01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,060
it's fine I know this person they're a

01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:50,670
nice person they don't mean it that way

01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:52,650
it's okay I can just talk about it

01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,270
rationally it's all good everyone could

01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:56,730
just be nice and it's just I know it's

01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:58,349
hard to stop and take a breather but

01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:00,210
honestly if we all stopped before we

01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:03,710
sent that tweet sometimes we'd probably

01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:06,060
a lot happier individuals overall and so

01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:09,150
it's not just people coming in to the

01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:11,250
project or key Jupiter's going out it

01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:12,960
could be even within the projects so

01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:16,259
basically the point is we all need to

01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:18,120
improve I know this sounds a little

01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:20,700
biased towards maintainer x' but

01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:23,009
honestly it's because it is scale factor

01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:24,920
here plays a huge part in terms of good

01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:27,600
maintainer is getting a lot more

01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:30,380
obviously a beaut basically alright I'll

01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,450
just say it getting more abuse then

01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:35,580
contributors so for instance show of

01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:36,750
hands who uses open source by the way

01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:39,630
Python is open source so everyone should

01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:42,989
raise your hands okay so keep them up

01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:46,339
sorry okay now keep your hand up if you

01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:48,779
actually maintain an open source project

01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:53,880
okay so do you seem out drop now who

01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:54,690
maintains Python yeah so in case people

01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,580
can't see

01:08:54,690 --> 01:09:00,719
I'm counting maybe three right now five

01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:03,330
okay we got about three out there so

01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:06,089
less than 10 out of this entire room so

01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:07,770
my point is is all of you can contribute

01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:09,210
to Python and there's less than ten of

01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,799
us in this room who helped maintain it

01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:16,500
so there's a real scale problem here

01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:19,440
where it's very easy for even a tenth or

01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,180
100th percent of the community to be

01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,980
negative and have to have a major impact

01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:26,549
because it's the amount of people coming

01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:27,660
in and I've I'm sure a lot of us have

01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:30,180
heard the phrase that it takes ten

01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:32,339
kindnesses to undo one negative action I

01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,910
don't know if that's ever been proven

01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,130
the cycle

01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,990
research but it sure feels right and

01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,940
it's kind of tough to go begging on

01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:40,410
Twitter for kindnesses for people to say

01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:43,020
things when you've had that really bad

01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:45,120
interaction and sometimes I will admit I

01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,600
have done it just to not feel crappy for

01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,600
the rest of the day

01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:53,190
basically everyone used to act needs to

01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,480
act like your kindness does not require

01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:56,700
anything returned I think that's a

01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,200
really key thing that we don't do so

01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:02,370
like for instance when you send me that

01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:04,590
PR please try to remember that I might

01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:07,110
have to say no for various reasons right

01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:08,520
it's nothing personal just view it as

01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:09,570
you're doing me a kindness in the

01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,280
community kindness by at least

01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:13,560
attempting this pull request and saying

01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:17,280
mean that change if I can't take it

01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,690
I'm sorry but it happens and if we could

01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,850
just realize that that's how this is

01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:22,470
interactions supposed to be it's okay

01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:24,270
and it goes the other way right like if

01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:25,800
you send me a pull request and I ask you

01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:28,410
to make changes and you don't get to it

01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,360
that's fine right I'm asking you as a

01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:31,740
kindness to please update your PR so I

01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,340
can accept it and if you don't have the

01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,470
time that's fine it just is what it is

01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:39,690
um but it's not a bargain right it's not

01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:41,490
like hey if I send you this PR then I

01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:42,960
want you to accept it or if I send you a

01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,400
request to change it then I expect you

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,710
to make the changes it doesn't work like

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,720
that this is how we end up in the

01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:51,210
situation where people just get really

01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:56,010
upset and it's just just not lead to

01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:57,360
sustainability um and it goes both ways

01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:59,130
right like if you're doing me a kindness

01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,080
I need to act like everything's be done

01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:02,340
as a kindness to me as I said if you

01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,800
send it to me I also need to realize

01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,440
that you're doing me if you're trying to

01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,110
be very nice here and I should show the

01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,480
same kind of empathy is sympathy back

01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:15,900
and this can also get tricky when people

01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,430
just have a communication style that

01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,500
doesn't Nestle lend itself to coming off

01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:20,820
as kind so it's always good to try to

01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,410
give people the benefit of the doubt and

01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:25,200
it's totally fine to say hey just you

01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:27,030
know the way you phrase this was kind of

01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,740
came off wrong I think and I don't think

01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:29,940
he really meant it this way so please

01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,300
could you maybe next time just try to

01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:34,830
phrase it differently and honestly most

01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:38,580
of the time people say oh I'm sorry I

01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:41,070
didn't know that day this is not my

01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,080
first language what have you and that's

01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:45,000
totally acceptable and totally fine and

01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,469
it's always reasonable to just let

01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,420
people know that the

01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,900
first things wasn't great at but it's

01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,499
okay and I didn't take it personally and

01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:57,960
we're all good and we'll just keep

01:11:52,499 --> 01:11:59,909
moving forward so basically how should

01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,590
we act towards each other when we view

01:11:59,909 --> 01:12:03,570
everything is kindness well we should be

01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:06,239
open to people doing kindnesses for us

01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:07,949
right like I should be open to all of

01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:10,380
you doing a kindness for the projects of

01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:14,400
Python and sunniest feedback and send

01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:16,440
these pull requests etc we then asked

01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,729
that you be considerate about the

01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,979
response that we give to your kindness

01:12:17,729 --> 01:12:22,530
so if you send us a pull request just

01:12:19,979 --> 01:12:24,530
understand we might have to say no and

01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:28,079
then just being respectful about that

01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:31,949
response right like being totally okay

01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:35,130
that I had to say no now shock of shocks

01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:36,840
this is the PSF code of conduct right

01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:39,989
being open being considerate and be

01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:44,280
respectful or it's kind of a three-way

01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:46,349
handshake of kindness basically you're

01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:50,429
going to me and saying hey here's the

01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:53,489
pull request thank you very much okay

01:12:50,429 --> 01:12:56,909
great I know that seems shockingly

01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:59,010
difficult sometimes but that's all it

01:12:56,909 --> 01:13:01,920
takes for this whole endeavor of open

01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:04,739
source to function reasonably literally

01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:07,289
no it's just nice thing I'm trying to do

01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:10,079
here you go okay thank you I appreciate

01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:11,729
what you did okay if it doesn't any word

01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:14,340
that's not a problem and every step of

01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:17,159
there things can fall apart right you

01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:23,880
say here's something to fix your broken

01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:25,170
pile of whatever like okay or here's

01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,440
this thing I'm trying to help you I

01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:30,479
thing like no this is garbage

01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,639
right or here's this nice thing okay

01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,030
great thanks I'm sorry I can't accept it

01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:37,889
this is gonna break away too much code

01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:38,999
I'll screw you then alright there's so

01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:40,559
many ways this thing can break down

01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:41,729
because there's three steps right I mean

01:13:40,559 --> 01:13:44,909
I'm not kidding this is a three-way

01:13:41,729 --> 01:13:47,340
handshake just like TCP and the

01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:49,260
connection gets dropped in kindness if

01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,539
you don't keep it going the whole time

01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,249
and it's very easy and as I've said I

01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:55,650
understand we all have bad days

01:13:53,249 --> 01:13:57,869
but it's also not hard to step away from

01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:00,119
the email and the github issue tracker

01:13:57,869 --> 01:14:02,610
for an hour before you can't have

01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:05,789
a cool head and deal with your bad day

01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:08,159
we all have them I've had them we just

01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:12,329
all need to keep working to be better at

01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:16,050
it so how can we try to communicate

01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:17,969
better online in general right so one

01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:19,349
thing assume you're asking me a favor I

01:14:17,969 --> 01:14:20,879
know I'm talking about kindnesses here

01:14:19,349 --> 01:14:22,590
and you're not specifically asking me a

01:14:20,879 --> 01:14:24,689
favor but it's a good way to frame it

01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:26,610
right like if you came up to me at PyCon

01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:28,709
is that hey Brett can you look at this

01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:31,649
PR and review it for me or are you gonna

01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:34,619
come up review my PR darn it and do it

01:14:31,649 --> 01:14:37,889
now no right because you know I'm gonna

01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:39,840
go hell no go away leave me alone I'm

01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:42,389
talking better better people right now

01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,860
who are nicer to me right I don't he put

01:14:42,389 --> 01:14:46,590
in that position and you wouldn't do

01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:47,280
that right you'd come up say hey can I

01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:49,169
talk to you real quick

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,249
I have this PR I'd love to get reviewed

01:14:49,169 --> 01:14:51,899
do you think you'll have a chance during

01:14:50,249 --> 01:14:53,489
the Sprint's to review it I'll go yeah

01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:57,059
it's send me the number I'll try to have

01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:59,489
a look once again not complicated it's

01:14:57,059 --> 01:15:02,099
just something we need to do now another

01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:05,280
way to phrase things assume your boss is

01:15:02,099 --> 01:15:06,959
gonna read it by the way I do pay

01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,780
attention to who works at one company

01:15:06,959 --> 01:15:12,659
and I have a pretty good memory so I

01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:15,989
won't forget so do try to represent your

01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:18,329
companies well online and hopefully you

01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:19,649
care about your jobs such that if you

01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:20,550
care how your boss is gonna read

01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:24,090
something that you'll put a little

01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:26,070
effort into see how it is phrased now if

01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,929
you don't care about your boss hope you

01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:29,489
care about your family

01:15:26,929 --> 01:15:31,979
and so you'll care about what they think

01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:33,599
about how you wrote something so

01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:35,189
hopefully across those three somewhere

01:15:33,599 --> 01:15:37,229
along there it's gonna cause you to stop

01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:41,399
and think about how you phrase something

01:15:37,229 --> 01:15:42,749
because really it's it's okay to take

01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:44,820
some time to phrase that email

01:15:42,749 --> 01:15:46,139
appropriately the first time you can

01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:49,260
wait you can proofread just take the

01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:50,820
time and just think about like all right

01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,199
in my phrasing this way I think this

01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,360
person would actually be willing to do a

01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:56,309
favor for me would this piss off my boss

01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:01,079
and would my parents approve of the way

01:15:56,309 --> 01:16:04,019
I'm communicating online with others so

01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:05,550
basically someone all this up please try

01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:09,269
to pay for open source with kindness

01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:12,689
right because if we don't those of us

01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:13,890
who participate Sartori credit and at

01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:16,050
least a Burnout

01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:17,640
and it that's not a good position to put

01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:21,810
ourselves in and we really just don't

01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:23,220
want to end up in that place where I had

01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,110
to be put in a position where my wife

01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,940
has to start asking me could you spend

01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:29,280
less time on open source I don't like

01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,330
how it's making you as a person and I

01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,520
think that's the last place any of us

01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:34,380
want to be and I think we all want to

01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,430
take this grand experiment of open

01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:39,240
source and continue to see it move

01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:40,380
forward and another thing is I can only

01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,820
imagine what this is like in other

01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,740
communities we have an absolutely

01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:45,900
amazing community that is known to be

01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:48,510
extremely welcoming and kind and even

01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:51,210
and I have a hard time sometimes with

01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:52,620
the way I can be treated I can only

01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:54,090
imagine what it was like in any other

01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:55,770
community on the planet and people have

01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:59,930
talked to you about this talk have all

01:16:55,770 --> 01:17:02,280
said oh yeah it's so much worse so I

01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:04,020
really feel for people who are not lucky

01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,060
enough to be in this community but the

01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:09,630
key point is if I'm having our time in

01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:12,660
this awesome amazing community I'm

01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:14,460
really worried how this is going for the

01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,700
rest of the open-source community as a

01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,130
whole

01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:18,660
so I'm hoping all of you can at least

01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,340
take some time next time you need to

01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:23,460
provide feedback write that blog post

01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:25,050
write that tweets send that PR or if

01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,060
you're a maintainer when you review that

01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:29,130
PR and have to make the tough decision

01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,840
to say no or what have you so just take

01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:32,450
the time to stop and realize we're all

01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,350
just trying to be kind to each other and

01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:37,370
we're all just trying to make this work

01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,370
thank you

01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:44,100
