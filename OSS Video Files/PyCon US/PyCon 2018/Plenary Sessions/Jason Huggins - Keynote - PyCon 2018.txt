hey Jess how much time do I have

00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:16,139
sure yeah okay got it

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,910
thirty starting now my screen also goes

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,670
off in 30 minutes so if the screen goes

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,269
off anyway um thank you for having me

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,150
here my name is Jason Huggins you are at

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,500
the Python education summits I am hugs

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,050
on Twitter so that's on the top right

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,439
hand corner that's a story for another

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,850
day

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,950
I got that one as Jess mentions these

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,840
are the things I've started if you're in

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,149
kind of boring businessÃ­ world you

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,340
probably knows these things if not then

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,640
you don't that's okay

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,920
I guess maybe a summary of these things

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,449
is I I've spent my career making virtual

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,300
robots that do web testing and type

00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:59,789
words into fields and click buttons and

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,170
the summary of all this is that I was

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,730
slightly frustrated in my career where

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,350
I'm making these virtual robots and all

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,450
I want to do is make real robots so this

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,119
talk is all about very real tangible

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,380
robots and the way I would describe you

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,880
know selenium er and things like that

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,890
like this would be my go-to slide for

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,659
this stuff right I can't I think this is

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,509
a project somewhere in Japan I think was

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,130
like f-zero X X I couldn't if I can't

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,500
find any other reference other Bend back

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,930
to my own slides now like it's down the

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,659
memory hole of the Internet but anyway

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,240
but it's not my robot though so I wanted

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,340
to test my metaphor over all these years

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,140
and to actually make a robot a real

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,450
robot that clicks buttons and things so

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,900
anyway so this is a third generation of

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,369
Angry Birds playing technology and I

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,899
think I've got some audio for these

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,680
things because you know that's what

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:51,090
really makes the game I think there's an

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,210
audio jack where did it go oh it's

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,250
plugged Matt it doesn't matter just this

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,960
is just the highlights this is actually

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,930
I'm saving the torture this is playing

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:06,540
heart and soul and a client a client

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,489
wanted to see two robots working in

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,660
tandem and so they actually wanted to do

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,039
like text messaging it's like that's a

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,180
boring demo so I showed up with this and

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,910
they're like okay that's great

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,570
impressive but like can it actually do

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,880
text messaging like that anyway but uh

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,990
anyway and then this is one really good

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,410
audio it doesn't really matter

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,510
using the 2001 you know Blue Danube the

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,430
the customer request was to turn on the

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,740
phone get to the bootloader and then

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,930
turn it off and that's literally

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,950
designed an entire robot to do that

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,510
there's no other way to do it well weird

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,740
stories you can either charge it or we

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,060
can get to the bootloader two different

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,280
cables but you can't do both the same

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,110
cable it's like either splice cables or

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,180
just hire me to build robots in anyway

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,610
so did that and then the other complaint

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,380
this is the latest version it was it's

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,440
not going fast enough so I killed that

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:58,610
feature request this is now 700 taps per

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,930
minute I think I can go a little bit

00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,110
higher but now like you know everything

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,310
like the walls start caving in whatever

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,610
anyway so that's my day job just kind of

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,520
just putting that out there but also the

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:15,080
reason why I'm here is because basically

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,920
flashback to the fall / winter of 2017

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,700
not too far away

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm also the coach for my kids FIRST

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,690
LEGO League the tech club after school

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,700
program at my kids school that's my son

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:32,180
Declan and this is I think late November

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,890
in the computer room and this is the

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,959
first Lego we've got this like very

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,100
large ping-pong table size thing just

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,110
kind of setting up what your with a

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,840
video about to show you and we're

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,760
getting ready for the competition and so

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,280
they're there you have to solve various

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,350
robot missions and get back to home base

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,690
successfully and so Declan this is now

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,989
the returning back to home base that's

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,540
the setup for the exposition here again

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,910
the audio isn't so important but they

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,830
were able to drop off the blue thing in

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,320
the bottom corner and then get back to

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,970
home base safely and that's my son in

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,410
the top right hand corner family that's

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,640
Finley and Declan and the other kids in

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:18,350
the program and so we started the

00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,080
program actually three years ago and

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,729
actually based on a talk that I only

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,110
gave at PyCon a couple years ago I've

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,830
actually been very nervous about my

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,330
relation

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,000
ship with FIRST LEGO League specifically

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,560
because its competition focused and some

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,629
of the things that Naomi mentioned in

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,189
the talk years ago was like I think I

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,030
actually asked it at PyCon like well

00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,590
what do you think of a competition

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,080
focused based programs and a lot of them

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,250
are first is all about that this is a

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,110
slight tangent but this is actually

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,120
speaks to your point because this this

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,780
is a PyCon moment and it's kept with me

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,150
for years I saw this in this competition

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,770
we had two teams the six graders my son

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,009
younger sons the six grade and the

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,659
eighth grader team and in the heat of

00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,319
battle

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,639
it's one thing to make a robot

00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,800
accomplish the mission it's great you

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,810
know like but now you get into this kind

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,879
of weird karate kid' finals kind of

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,319
moment where you now have to not just

00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,259
make the robot do the thing but defeat

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,889
all other people you end up some kids at

00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,389
least you end up ruining it because now

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,000
you've taken the sweetness of just

00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,469
making a cool robot into this weird

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,539
competitive thing some kids thrive in

00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:26,599
that some kids don't and so I've been

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,009
very I'm just I've got like this weird

00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:30,169
thing about FIRST LEGO League and I

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,789
think that competition focus thing again

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,900
this is a slight ramp but part of the

00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,000
reason why I even got into this is

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,199
because I saw Dean Kaman speak if you

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,900
haven't seen he's the guy who created

00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,389
first I could end up giving a whole talk

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,099
about first but I'll try to keep this

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,139
short one of the most inspirational

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,940
speeches I've ever seen was Dean Kaman

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,139
and and one of the reasons why we

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,889
started this club was because of that

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,180
that talk and he basically said like I'm

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,800
butchering the phrase but something

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,719
along the lines of as a culture we are

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,370
what we celebrate and his point is we

00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:02,900
celebrate celebrities and sports stars

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:05,539
and so if we want kids to be interested

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:10,069
in engineering we have to make it as

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:13,129
cool to be an engineer as it is to be a

00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:15,110
music star or or an athlete and so the

00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:19,190
the competitions when you go into a

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,319
first competition they often rent out at

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,990
least the ones in Chicago where I live

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,699
for the high school level they actually

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,199
rent out UIC Pavilion that the

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,129
basketball arena you go in there you

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,469
don't know what's going on but you could

00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:33,050
buy popcorn and a coke and you know

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:36,560
watch the spectacle and it really is as

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,940
exciting as going and seeing a like a

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,940
sports thing if you're in a sports ball

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,020
so but you get so his thing was now

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,720
because it's a big thing people want to

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,270
sponsor it people want to be in all of

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,350
that excitement and so kids are getting

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,840
scholarships just like you would get an

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,370
athletic scholarship or anyway so he's

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,830
got this whole thing but the problem is

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,410
that you've also then inherited all of

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,430
the problems of I guess the hero worship

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,200
or whatever you want to call the

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,280
problems that go along with very

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,100
important impactful whatever you want to

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,230
call it sports programs or you know you

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,030
know rock bands and just all of all of

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,130
the bad side of it more specifically

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:22,180
within the sports context of and this I

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:23,500
think I see and first and we saw this in

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,430
the competition that the team that won

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,400
they team bumblebee sorry to out them

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,940
but there's one little loophole in the

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,830
first first rules then it really bugged

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,380
me but you can drive a truck through

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,110
this loophole you can use any Lego that

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,940
Lego has manufactured ever so you have

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,010
these kits and we only have enough money

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,330
to buy these kits but the teams that win

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,979
basically as long as you can fit

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,440
anything as long as your thing can fit

00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:55,030
in this circle maybe there's like a

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,070
two-foot height limit or something you

00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,660
can use whatever you want and so they

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,460
went off on eBay and bought probably

00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,080
thousands of dollars of Lego and once

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,030
you have that they were basically the

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,729
New York Yankees of FIRST LEGO League

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,130
and there's this feeling going away my

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:10,930
take away from first was one there's

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,610
this competition focused aspect of it

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,229
and some of the kids totally like they

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,450
didn't come back this this last semester

00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,460
I think they just were that's it and I

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,960
hope they not to get all teary eyed but

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,310
I hope I didn't ruin engineering for

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,870
them just because of the this weird

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,090
competition thing but the other one is I

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,410
was kind of left over Christmas break I

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,100
was kind of in a funk over this thing of

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,530
like do we do I opt out do I just nope

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,530
the whole thing on team bumblebee and

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,330
just say like look we to beat them or

00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,950
one is like okay do I even want to beat

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,950
them no but here we are putting these

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,659
kids into this competition do we opt out

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,790
of competitions or do we if we can't

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,500
beat them join them go and just blow

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,950
more money into this whole program so

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,750
I'm really anyway this is a version but

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,830
this is really kind of sets where my

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,660
mind was

00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,800
the month of December right after this

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,110
competition and where Jess kind of saw

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,000
me we're hacking on stuff so I'm trying

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,950
to solve lots of problems it's a rather

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,990
ambitious thing and it's going to take a

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,779
lot longer than I realized but where my

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,310
head was at is that I think right where

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:17,860
you have a program it's like 10 to 20

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,180
kids the cost like Lego and an even

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,740
Apple and when you talk about like the

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,649
iPads that used to program them they're

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,560
just right they've but they've found

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,850
this genius sweet spot if like 10 to 20

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,570
kids where you can extract the most

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,220
amount of money from people and so it's

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,450
like you know imagine like 5,000 to

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,850
10,000 bucks like oh man that's really

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,290
tough but like oh it's only at only

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,120
5,000 bucks oh maybe we could hire grant

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,740
whatever it meanwhile over like in

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,149
Enterprise land like that's a complete

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,519
non-starter like you're just having to

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,410
set up a server farm of thousands of

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,680
machines you absolutely will not be

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,850
doing the gold-plated you know max or

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,140
Dell machines in there you're gonna be

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,690
doing like the absolute commodity

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,829
hardware and running Linux on those

00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,630
things right so like when you've got

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,570
like a hundred or a thousand stuff

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,520
absolutely cost is is totally the thing

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,350
but when we're in this setup where you

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,380
got like five you need five kits or ten

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,860
kits the the money situation it's really

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,149
hard to prioritize the less to spend a

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,649
year and drive the cost down and nothing

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,230
because like we'll have nothing only

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,700
I've lost a year of kids working as such

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,589
like okay fine let's just pay the money

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,899
anyway sidenote well that's where that's

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,459
my state of mind is even though this is

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,279
not any day job I'm really trying to

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:32,500
figure out how to make the tech program

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,709
be better and we adopted FIRST LEGO

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,779
League as because it was an easy

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,760
curriculum to pick up but I would love

00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:41,020
that there are things that I would that

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,089
I don't see in this program that would

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,890
love to have and that's kind of where my

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:46,890
head is at all right I've got 20 minutes

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,790
so when my other kind of rants here was

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,550
we bought five kits we had twenty kids

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,769
and my analogy here is that it's kind of

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,800
like trying to teach a roomful of

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:02,170
students and you only have one vial in

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,850
an hour our club even though some clubs

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,579
they meet you know it's actually if it's

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,699
a kids and their parents they'll work on

00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,739
it every day but ours

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:11,480
an after-school program we compete with

00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:13,579
lots of activities so we meet every

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,379
other week for two hours so imagine if

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,899
you only got to practice your violin for

00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:19,790
a shared violin with too many other kids

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,720
for two hours every two weeks like how

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,459
much are they actually gonna learn in

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,169
the environment an environment also when

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,399
kids like sometimes they come to the one

00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:27,109
meeting and then don't come the next one

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,549
we've got five different kits so five

00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:30,649
different kind of robots then you have

00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:34,040
to spend first part of the meeting just

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,049
kind of putting back on you know at the

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,209
mr. Potato Head kind of quality to like

00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,859
getting two wheels and whatever anyways

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,009
so the other thing I'm trying to solve

00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:47,540
is if I want to get to one robot per

00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:49,779
child which is famous well there was the

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,949
famous One Laptop Per child project

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,779
which kind of succeeded in kind of

00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:57,189
didn't write cosmically it succeeded but

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:59,600
you know tactically I guess it didn't

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:02,209
buts a noble cause I would like to get

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,879
to maybe not getting every kid on every

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:07,249
continent a robot but just specifically

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:12,199
one robot for the twenty kids that I'm

00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:14,299
responsible for in Oak Park Illinois how

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,799
do i how do I get there right so some of

00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,939
my options I can spend more money that's

00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,209
like you know if I can't beat them join

00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:20,359
them

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:23,359
go alt you know go all-in on you know

00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:24,799
beating team bumblebee next year make

00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:28,160
the kits cheaper or pick a different

00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,839
protect program I went at least this

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,989
talk is all about making that kits

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,449
cheaper and all the implications of that

00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:36,919
but those other options like you could I

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,509
could spend of I could have spent all my

00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:44,029
effort on like trying to hire a fight

00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:45,109
fire hire if I apply for grants and see

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,850
how that goes

00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:48,379
but that I'm not in that world and some

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,149
people do that it's interesting though

00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:51,919
at the bottom of the link you know right

00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,269
under the 5,000 dollar price tag for

00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,399
when you go to Lego it's just like hey

00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,049
would you you know be interested in

00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,609
applying for grants like that they know

00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,139
everyone it has some sticker shock on

00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:03,439
this stuff so that's an option but I'm

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,819
just I adopting skills from and from

00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,709
Enterprise land like let's just make it

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:10,970
open source and super cheap and and

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:12,289
scale it out anyway so uh one thing as

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,879
I'm trying to imagine like how can I

00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:17,659
make this the absolute cheapest remind

00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:20,360
me of one of my toys from a child my

00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,570
childhood and this I would say that this

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,580
is how I learned to program

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,650
this is called bigtrack and it's super

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,960
awesome and here's a video of how you

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,150
would program bigtrack it was like a 30

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,460
40 dollar toy from Milton Bradley's

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,710
electronics division back a long time

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,060
ago and if you want a program let's see

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,830
this next video is like make it go

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,250
forward turn around and come back that's

00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,490
it

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,070
but you would that the point I'm showing

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,290
this is part of the cost it's not just

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,120
the Legos it's also the computer or the

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,220
tablet or the fancy iPad that goes with

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,840
it and so where my head was at was like

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,420
oh my gosh I could drive the robotics

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,970
kit down and nothing but I still have

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,310
this like fancy tablet expense that

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,290
blows the budget and and and where the

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,220
stuff is at is the Lego kit is like 400

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:07,620
bucks iPad is a little bit more for this

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,390
to be kind of any better it needs to be

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,060
weight all in for everything needs to be

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,130
cheaper than 400 bucks

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,150
ideally right anyway so I'm inspired by

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,830
other things that are super cheap but

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,880
super fun you cook at some solace and

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,100
learn stuff and I remember it like oh

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,450
there's this toy it and because it's got

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,000
this little touch screen on there or a

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,640
little keypad you don't need the you

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,090
know $400 iPad to go with it anyway so

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,830
this is me programming it to go forward

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,660
you have to enter because there's no

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,730
screen you're just gonna have to hope

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:40,190
you programmed it incorrectly you know

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,420
back in the day no interactive prompt

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,900
and then it goes forward this is my

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,150
office in a park fancy wood floors and

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,220
it comes back what's not in this demo is

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:56,160
it officer could fire laser cannons not

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,870
real lasers whatever okay so now that's

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,210
something I can't buy that was from a

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,960
long time ago but what I can buy is like

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,200
what it would be the modern-day

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,050
equivalent so this is a kits I think

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,950
like the actual chassis was from Micro

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,260
Center but all the electronics are I got

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,480
from Adafruit and this is the little

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,860
robot this is actually the Adafruit demo

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,630
code I think it just goes back and forth

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,060
it's actually I mean it's funny it got

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,440
this thing working I'm actually SSH into

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,180
it like this is like now modern-day

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,490
technology I've got my laptop and I'm

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,440
now SSH into my robot and I'm now

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,030
because it's a Raspberry Pi and I'm now

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,170
telling it to fire the motors super

00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,630
awesome right

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,190
and so like that's like oh maybe I maybe

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,970
I'll build a program or

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,500
this and I'll operationalize this but

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,090
then as I'm kind of playing around with

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,560
that I was thinking like well the

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,950
problem is I still have this laptop like

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,830
the laptop becomes now a problem again

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,870
this is kind of this is where my follow

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,540
me on my imagination on how I go dad

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,400
follow me down the rabbit hole right so

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,980
then it's like okay Raspberry Pi zero

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,260
I've got the it's it's the wireless so I

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,270
can connect to it I've got the Adafruit

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,730
motor hat for it

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,400
I guess I made it like shoes because I

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,220
put it under whatever the battery packs

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,230
maybe this whole thing is like $100 or

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,090
so maybe like 75 and components then

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,410
when you add the batteries and cables is

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,170
probably a hundred but the interesting

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,310
thing is they also have a camera this is

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,740
where the rabbit hole goes right it's

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,350
like okay well if I add a camera and

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,780
let's just say I want to get absolutely

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,700
we get rid of all the costs which means

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,350
get rid of the computer well how could

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,100
you even program it how could I get to

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,720
something like like this with this I

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,640
could put a keypad on here that's an

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,770
option but like let's make it hey it's

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,110
2018 but let's let's do it the most

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,910
ridiculous way and it's my project so

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,220
yeah whatever I said like this camera

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,700
like I wonder you know could I use the

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,860
camera as input for could could I

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,930
actually maybe like have like a QR code

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,680
or something like that of the program

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,820
and I can kind of look over the code and

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,470
this is where things get a little weird

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,620
I'd have to add some kind of feedback to

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,390
the to the kid to know that the thing

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,100
was loaded maybe I could blink an LED or

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,140
maybe I can add a speaker and so it

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,050
actually ends up kind of backing myself

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,540
into like a serie or cortana or alexa

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,310
kind of robot where it's talking like oh

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,420
I've found a program it looks and

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,709
tactically correct would you like me to

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,880
you could do this whole thing where I

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,490
don't have a screen I don't have a

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,189
tablet but the key thing is like I'm

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,439
using the Raspberry Pi to the horsepower

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,930
and the camera to read things in and so

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,790
then down the rabbit all I go I'm now

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,590
imagining what would a programming

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,330
language look like assuming that there

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:41,400
was no tablet and I am I am literally

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,900
like standing over some code the kid

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,140
reads it in and then we put it down on

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:50,780
the ground and then it can and it can go

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,780
so now for the adventure right

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,120
so I started thinking like okay I need

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,860
to have a programming language that's

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,190
going to be very bright and bold kind of

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,760
like QR codes gonna be very easy for the

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,919
computer to to read it right so ever we

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,059
all know QR codes but I stumbled into

00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,669
this idea it's like well what about a

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:13,070
mojit code cards prototype this is the

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,510
idea that Jess see if it works alright I

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,610
though the audio is a little bit

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:23,840
annoying this is me being impressed with

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:28,580
myself anyway but uh okay you can find

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:34,909
all the cards and this is the program

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:36,500
right so yes sweet okay so so uh so so

00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,789
this is all Python code behind the

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,620
scenes I haven't published it yet but I

00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:46,610
will maybe today hopefully there's a lot

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,409
going on here it seems simple like it's

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,360
a lot of like basic beginner kind of

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:51,799
Python OpenCV kind of stuff but then

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,110
I've actually tried to port it recently

00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,690
as in like very recent like 12 hours ago

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,820
to JavaScript and I failed miserably and

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,799
I realized actually like reconfirming

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,690
that Python was the absolute best

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,220
language to prototype this stuff in but

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:08,120
it's not just Python it's not just

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:11,510
OpenCV but it's like SK it was a science

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,070
tool kit numpy there's all of these

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,470
libraries and all the documentation

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,460
tutorials like it's so easy to get

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,110
started here but just like briefly kind

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:26,960
of jumping through like what the heck is

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:31,700
going on here first it scans the screen

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:34,250
and finds big black outlines if I can go

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,510
it so you can kind of do fine fine

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,799
contours so you can have like this

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:44,570
little thing and ill finds a big black

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,580
boundary and I can do that and then but

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,590
then if it's like skewed you have to

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,510
then like unscrew it so it's a perfect

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,580
square once I do that and there's

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,679
already skipping over a bunch of stuff

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,390
then you have to then get kind of a

00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,950
snapshot in there and I'm doing this

00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,990
very simple stuff it's not really emoji

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,960
it's more you know basic polygons at

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:07,130
this point I'm using like a triangle for

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,240
start and an octagon four stop it kind

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,360
of conceptually makes sense for the

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,919
start and stop of a program or in

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,590
JavaScript the open bracket close

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,390
bracket or whitespace magical whitespace

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,679
I couldn't use a white space program

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,510
because like how would it know where the

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,880
end of the program is I couldn't anyway

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,610
cosmic you know philosophical problem if

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,919
it's not in view is there no stop sign

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,390
like anyway so I feel like I had to add

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,950
some kind of stop sign for the code so

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,279
wait it would find those two things and

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,230
know the code is between them and then

00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,529
I'm actually using than other fancy

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,179
algorithms a match template I'm using to

00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,190
find these various shapes and then I'm

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:47,240
using another library called tesseract

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:49,279
and I'm using the font OCR be font which

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,770
then you get into some awesome machine

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,669
learning stuff here because you're using

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:56,330
a font design for machine vision a whole

00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:57,620
bunch of people have kind of

00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,570
standardized around that so there's some

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,880
training data that I can kind of slurp

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,360
into tesseract so then it instantly can

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,679
read the numbers there and so it kind of

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
like this is this cascading thing of

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,510
like trying to find the algorithm or

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,990
finding shapes with with number of sides

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,190
three it's a start eight it's stop

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,750
finding by template and if it can't find

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,169
if it can't find that so all these

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,750
if-else stuff then finds the numbers and

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:28,669
so this was like me finally kind of

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:31,750
getting it all working and when it can

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:38,809
pull it out you know oops

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:41,990
alright this was like December fifteenth

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:44,149
or so let's make fast forward here can

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,070
kind of see that it can kind of read

00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:48,649
everything correctly and then I also

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:53,000
have a sheet of all these numbers and it

00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:55,309
can read them all correctly and kind of

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,149
fun right so I've kind of succeeded very

00:21:55,309 --> 00:22:01,220
early on in in this in this imagination

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:03,049
little thing where potentially I could

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,049
read a program in with just a camera

00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:08,059
oh now granted this I was doing this on

00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,490
a fancy laptop and the horsepower

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,770
between that and this it's kind of up to

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,220
now to be tested to see if it's gonna be

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,220
fast enough

00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,370
there's lots of implications though but

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,970
one of the key things is I realize like

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,350
oh my gosh like I'm this is a real

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,880
program I can't just like read it in

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,260
like I actually have to have a parser an

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,850
interpreter like this is like a real

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,210
language and then I realized actually

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,400
this is nothing new I've basically

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,200
re-implemented logo as a programming

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,200
language and it's one of those things

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,580
like I've kind of seen this in different

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,160
things when you boil something down to

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,420
its absolute you know you know simpler

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,800
but you can't possibly make it any

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,760
simpler you end up bumping into a whole

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,050
bunch of other people who've already

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,330
done it so I'm not saying this is

00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,890
anything new if anything I'm realizing

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,570
I'm rediscovering stuff that is decades

00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,780
old and just so now I have a copy of

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,020
Mindstorms that I'm reading from Seymour

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,010
Papert

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,330
writing about this stuff anyway so now

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,830
like the last couple of months I've just

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:12,030
been kind of really going to school on

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,860
anyway how to actually implement a

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,380
programming language but specifically

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,480
through the lens of getting it read in

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:23,040
so emoji is you know annoyingly popular

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,420
but it's also like my key reason for

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,250
doing it is because the computers can

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,480
recognize it anyway so I originally

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,020
called the code cards I've moved on to

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,140
calling a wild card because why not this

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,580
would be the hello world in everyone

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,530
everyone has new hello world so this

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,910
would be the quintessential hello world

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:44,760
in wild card also for very deliberate

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,220
specific political reasons I am

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,150
purposely using the medium skin tone and

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,560
the world without continents because you

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,810
have to choose otherwise like which

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,580
which side of the globe you would you

00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:01,560
would you emphasize I try to get the

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,660
stats on you know what is the like

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,000
literally average skin tone of the world

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,280
I don't know if there was numbers on

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,570
that but also if it's you know it's

00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,890
hello world but doesn't say which world

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,440
it could be a different world so why not

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,910
just use a generation Eric globe anyway

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,910
so that that's the hello world I think

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,020
going forward if we do use emojis this

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,130
is going to be kind of a design decision

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm like which do we do each hour all

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,160
people created equal this is actually an

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,360
interesting kind of weird design thing

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,179
of like if you had a yellow hand

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,540
you know in a differently colored hand

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,740
are those evaluated as the same or are

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,690
those differences almost like case

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,130
sensitive variables you can have

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,559
uppercase and lowercase a are they the

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,179
same thing or they both a so I'm already

00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,970
bumping into some kind of weird design

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:52,480
issues just with this just at this code

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:56,140
of how how do you evaluate skin tones as

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,000
different variables anyway this would be

00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,799
other examples of hello world and wild

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,720
card as soon as you can see it's

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,040
hopefully a you know a well named

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,309
programming language because this is

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,130
pretty well so uh just like in Python

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,419
the hash hash mark is a comment so

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,370
there's two lines to the first two lines

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,860
don't evaluate and then this would be a

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:20,440
speech bubble and then I'm using the

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:22,030
pause emoji as quote marks because why

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,900
not right so that's hello world this

00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,059
would be a different one this would be

00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,980
creating a function and this would be

00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,919
the the circle would be kind of like

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,450
death and in Python land the name of the

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,000
function this would be a code block so

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,400
the start and stop and then that would

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,720
be the function and so if you've

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
implemented those two things as

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,559
functions that's how you would call it

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,140
that's one example I'm sorry you want to

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,970
take a picture I can show thee okay you

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,230
got it

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,610
I'll show the code later this would be

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,429
example three where he actually

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,000
instantiate or you created the globe as

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:58,950
a string and then the hand is actually

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,120
taking in that is the emoji for a label

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,340
so then you would do hello and then

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,890
label anyway it's kind of its kind of

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,660
fun and ridiculous right this would be

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,640
this is kind of this the end of

00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,250
screenshot of my test suite this is

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,240
where things also kind of go down

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,370
another rabbit hole

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,410
yeah this code there's no reason why it

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:22,419
has to be implemented right to left or

00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,970
sorry left to right it could be right to

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:27,570
left so this bottom R I've got a couple

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:31,870
languages in there there's Hebrew and I

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,850
forgot the name of the language not not

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,500
Farsi what's the or Arabic Arabic this

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,860
is arabic okay right yes Arabic also

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,330
goes like that way anyway so that I

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,470
think there's like the top 14 languages

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,130
so I think the other thing is like going

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,220
forward

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,590
make sure that it's as multilingual as

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,410
possible this is how you would do

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:53,380
numbers in wild card floating points

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:56,650
strings this is how you do importing so

00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,420
that's a box package import robot that

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,610
would be importing star some stealing a

00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,990
lot of stuff from Python this would be

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,030
importing one method this would be

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,320
importing several methods this be go

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,820
forward and back this would be a

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,580
function definition you could do it two

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,100
ways this would be a function call call

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,300
home right but if you want to do a

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,200
function reference like to figure out

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,720
how to do that and this is actually

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,100
implication of not using parentheses I

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,020
have to have this difference between

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,430
referring to a function versus calling

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,710
it and so the one thing I came up with

00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,500
Ruby runs into this same problem as well

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,790
some of those are linked paperclips so

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:34,300
that's a link get it to home whatever

00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:36,160
this would be how to dance why not this

00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,870
is the chronic equivalents Python code

00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,910
wild card code I'm super running out of

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,160
time and I want to get to a demo so just

00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,480
these are just like there's going to be

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,760
there all be up on the website I just

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,160
want to get a give you a flavor for this

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,990
ridiculous language I'm creating the

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,270
nice thing about this is on the left

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,440
forget the comments because this is a

00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,690
purely symbolic

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,750
there's no English key words there at

00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,730
all potentially this is useful granted

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,350
if you're going to get into the Linux

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,330
kernel stuff we're going to learn

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,770
English eventually but when you're just

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,110
getting kids to code potentially this is

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,460
useful you know and you don't have to

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,190
get over the english hurdle to

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,690
potentially you know make your robot go

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,990
forward sunglasses

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,900
number of steps right you could also do

00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:22,120
it as a one-liner left or right but why

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,500
not right to left right or there are

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,050
some languages that are top to bottom

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,770
it all works potentially if I implement

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:33,040
the partial correctly you could also

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,500
repeat loops for items and lists that's

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,630
uh lions and tigers and bears and then

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,210
prints that's a printer so print that

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,500
out to console this is the Konami code

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,820
this is my favorite this would be

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,900
syntactically valid I haven't

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,540
implemented it yet but this would be

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,640
syntactically correct there's some rules

00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:53,740
that I have to figure out on how you can

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,420
pass in a parameters to a function and

00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,960
and how you make that rule I could

00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,850
totally

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,070
Blue Lightning talked just on how will

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,740
happily implement functions and function

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,790
parameters and all that stuff anyway but

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:12,190
the cool thing I wanna get to is like

00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:21,370
okay but does it actually work so let's

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:23,890
see there's the I've got one minute you

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:28,150
know my password now whoops I have to

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:36,160
change everything now I seriously have

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:37,900
to okay uh my luggage bank everything I

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,680
don't need this

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:50,460
let's see okay come on this is what I

00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:54,370
wanted to show you yeah baby let's see

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:58,810
got 20 seconds I think I had agree on

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,700
the ISO happiness didn't timeout oh come

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:07,450
on

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:11,230
here we go allow okay so one thing I've

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:13,600
learned is lighting is kind of important

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,980
but imagine this isn't actually perc I

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,240
showed you all this code but this would

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,910
be the robot and instead of there

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,260
instead of a box it would actually be a

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:27,520
robot replace this this is a program

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:32,550
called AR JJ s and then this is where

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,630
the the project took another rabbit hole

00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,240
there's this thing of like having the

00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,080
robotics kit but now if I'm using a

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,900
started testing around with this with

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,200
like tablets the punchline here to this

00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:46,960
now over time I have been testing this

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,760
on like super cheap like $50 tablets and

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,110
because they all have like these back

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,550
cameras and so there's this thing of

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,040
like potentially as a starting point

00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:58,390
again this is like a huge project now if

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,620
the final goal is the robotics kit with

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,910
some kind of way to program it one

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,130
stepping stone potentially is I just

00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:07,470
give these kids like these $50 Amazon

00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,470
fire tablets and they could implement

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:14,090
again you can kind of bring this back

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,700
home we can lock it down whoops let's

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,680
see if it actually still loads here the

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,090
code potentially be read on the left and

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,530
then your robot is literally your

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,510
virtual robot is sitting right there and

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,700
then potentially I can click the green

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,050
tap and then it can program so it's so

00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,360
there's this weird thing where I'm kind

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,830
of reimplemented logo and it's two forms

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,210
one is a real robot then two is like

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,340
computer screen robot but now it's like

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,590
3d and potentially because it's this

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,720
augmented reality thing there's no

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,040
reason why I can it has to be limited to

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,410
go only and going on the tabletop

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,680
potentially could go in 3d and paint all

00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:47,270
over the room anyway so so there's this

00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,770
weird thing we're now where I'm at is

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,540
even though it started with the

00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:52,610
Raspberry Pi and the camera and making a

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:56,780
kit I'm now been spending a lot of time

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:59,360
on just the language and this AR thing

00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,400
so then like when I hit play I can play

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,750
it around here and I'll probably be

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,000
playing around with it today just

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:07,160
getting the software to work and this is

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,320
also kind of running up on Heroku so if

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,730
you had a phone literally as long as you

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,110
printed this out you could start playing

00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,310
around with it like right now so it

00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:18,680
doesn't require any any native

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,910
application string like that yet anyway

00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,130
there's a couple other things to show

00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,000
but I'm now way over time so that's it

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:28,980
for now I'll be around all day and yeah

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:36,680
ask me any questions later though thanks

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,680
