00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:08,519
as an attendee speaker and volunteer for

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:21,960
many years dan is no stranger to PyCon

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:24,830
so please welcome Dan Callahan good

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,240
morning Cleveland good morning PyCon I

00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,680
guess you saw a preview of this slide

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,439
during earnest talk instead of the code

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,770
of conduct and that's cool it's it's

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:37,170
completely unrelated this is the IBM PC

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,329
jr. I'm gonna be talking about platforms

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,629
and and this is a platform that was

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,140
released in 1984 it was IBM's first

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,879
offering for home consumers it made

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,010
headlines just not the ones that IBM

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,840
wanted Time magazine calls it the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,780
biggest flop one of the biggest flops in

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,539
the history of computing and they

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,129
weren't alone in that opinion

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,180
commercially perhaps objectively this

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,600
was a bad computer

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,830
it was a bad platform but you know how

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,490
your parents are about technology

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,340
decisions that was when my dad decided

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,840
that he wanted to buy a computer so he

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,810
came home with the PC jr. during its

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,110
short 1 year of being available on the

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,030
market and when I became old enough to

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,549
become interested in computers and

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,280
interested in programming that was what

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,610
I had at you know access in my living

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,990
room as a consequence the first

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,560
programming language I was exposed to

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,119
was basic PC junior came with basic had

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,759
a PC junior that's what I was going to

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,000
learn and I didn't realize it at the

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,710
time but the choice of what my first

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,079
programming language was going to be was

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,369
made for me I didn't get to think about

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,960
what was the best language what was the

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,399
most welcoming community what was my

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,079
local community using and supporting the

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,960
platform I was using completely dictated

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,960
the tool that I was going to learn

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,299
fast-forward a few years this was me in

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,770
high school

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,789
and you can see I had great posture and

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,459
impeccable fashion sense

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,439
but I was also fortunate enough to have

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,430
my own computer and on that computer I

00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,530
was able to experiment with

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,140
sophisticated tools like Perl and PHP

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,329
and Linux but I still found myself

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,819
programming basic because I went through

00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:26,769
high school in an era before smartphones

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,060
so when I was bored in class there

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,280
wasn't a whole lot I could do about it

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,439
somehow we survived and and one of the

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,329
ways we got through those long days was

00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,909
with a graphing calculator the TI 82

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,530
somehow we've managed to ring something

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:45,310
resembling fun out of this lifeless gray

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,129
brick and we did that because that

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,609
calculator was programmable you just had

00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:52,689
to use basic and so at that point I

00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,000
learned that it didn't matter that at

00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:57,129
home when I was exploring software for

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,049
myself that I had access to more

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,569
sophisticated tools or a more powerful

00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,409
platform when I went to school if I

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,180
wanted to build something I could

00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:07,780
actually share with my friends and I

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,919
could actually interact with I had to do

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,540
that in basic because that was the

00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:15,870
platform we had we had the graphing

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:22,229
calculators fast forward to this year in

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,229
January I became a father and thank you

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,060
not the best pair programming session

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:33,150
I've ever had but this was good in other

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,580
ways and I started looking at my son and

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,880
wondering what will computers look like

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,280
for his generation and not just not just

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,540
in you know Western countries and you

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
know upper middle-class households but

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,360
but also around the world what are

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,069
people going to be writing software on

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,500
what are people going to be using what's

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,790
the platform going to look like and then

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,050
what tools are going to be native to

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,370
that platform what tools are going to

00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:59,880
make it easy to address that platform

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,170
maybe it could be Python my name is Dan

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,540
Callahan you can find me on Twitter as

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,340
Cal ahead I work for Mozilla I've been

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,590
there six years I actually joined

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,150
Mozilla during the PyCon 2012 sprints so

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,340
that's me during new employee

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,730
orientation wearing my PyCon shirt

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,320
really proud to be there it's you can

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,850
watch me awkwardly introduce myself on

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,850
YouTube if you want I worked for Mozilla

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,680
because I personally believe in the

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,140
power of the web to and the potential of

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,729
the web to do good to connect people to

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,640
educate people to empower people to

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,289
transcend borders the web is an amazing

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,750
medium and Mozilla is a nonprofit

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:39,990
dedicated to advancing and safeguarding

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,940
the web as a public resource we

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,490
predominantly do that by developing the

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,340
Firefox family of web browsers and we

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,260
build Firefox so that when the other

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,060
major browsers which are developed by

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,289
Apple and Microsoft and Google meet to

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,460
determine the future of their browsers

00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,410
in the future of the web and the future

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,690
of this platform that we've earned our

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,039
place in the room and can advocate for a

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,340
balance between private interest in

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:04,860
public interest online in my time at

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,919
Mozilla I've learned that we are utterly

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,690
reliant on Python we couldn't build

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,240
develop test or release our software

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,919
without it

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:21,750
fortunately Python is a great tool but

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,280
that's what it is right a tool I feel

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,889
like calling Python a tool despite

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,740
Python being such a powerful and such a

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,970
versatile and such an empowering tool

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,349
it's selling it short because Python is

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,760
more than cool python is a community

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,680
that happens to have a programming

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,180
language attached to it and that

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,960
community is what brought us all into

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,729
this room today that

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,669
community is what what let's somebody

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,740
walk into Python and feel welcome and we

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,910
intentionally try to bring people into

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,199
this community that don't look like us

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,030
that don't use software the way we do

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,930
that work in different fields than we do

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,849
and that's rare and valuable so python

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:58,319
is a tool but pythons also more than

00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:00,330
that I attended my first pike on 10

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,889
years ago and I've been present or

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,930
volunteered at or spoken at every pike

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,630
on sense until last year last year when

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,880
the call for proposals went out I sat

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,860
down and I I reflected on on what I

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,370
might want to speak about a pike on and

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,870
I came to the the really sad realization

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,520
that I didn't think I had anything left

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,750
to say to this community because I

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,060
realized that in my personal in my

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,280
professional life I had moved on to

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,880
platforms where Python didn't have a

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,860
great story

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,360
and Python wasn't as relevant to me and

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,810
that was tragic I don't I don't want to

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,759
leave Python but but the tools and the

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,590
and the places I were it didn't have the

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,870
same story and didn't have the same

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,300
versatility and people move on and

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,860
that's okay but you know maybe maybe

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,979
Python doesn't have to be everything to

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,789
everyone but damn it for a while we were

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,289
there's a saying in the Python community

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:55,889
that Python is the second best language

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:57,570
for anything and no doubt you're

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,120
laughing that's an amazing aspiration

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,830
because that aspiration says that we're

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
not the most specialized tool but we may

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,400
be the most versatile we may be the most

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,810
universal we're a tool that you can

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,490
learn once and take with you if you're

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,570
doing systems administration or you're

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,060
doing web development or you're in

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,490
education or you're in data science

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,520
Python goes everywhere and that's

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,900
incredible and that strength is is

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,449
something that I think is captured in

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,490
this but I don't think that's accurate

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,710
because for one especially if you look

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,830
at the schedule for this conference this

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,990
year python is the first best language

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,270
in many domains at least in the sciences

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,460
and in education and that's no small

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,139
feat that's that's decades of work from

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,150
people like you sitting in this room

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,650
trying to bring Python to more

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,080
environments more ecosystems more

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,490
audiences more people because what's

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,229
programming about why are we program if

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,510
not to serve people if not to solve

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:53,550
human problems

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:55,920
I also don't think that that's saying

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,600
that idiom holds because there are

00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,150
platforms where Python isn't the second

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,480
best choice and it's not even a

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,520
reasonable choice what do I mean if

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,140
you're working in an field where you can

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,210
target traditional computing platforms

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,030
if you can target Windows Mac OS and

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,020
Linux on a laptop or a server Python is

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,070
and remains and will be an amazing tool

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,830
we have excellent support for those

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,500
platforms but those aren't the only

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,090
computers anymore people are

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,340
increasingly moving to iOS Android

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,310
devices just going straight to the web

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,960
with things like Chrome OS and more and

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,160
more this is becoming what people think

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,240
of when they think of a computer or

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,380
maybe they don't think of a computer

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,390
it's just the computer they happen to

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,800
have because I'll leave my house without

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,090
my laptop but if I leave my house

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,580
without my phone I'm gonna turn around

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,110
and go get it and so like the graphing

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,700
calculator this is the platform that I

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,220
have with me this is the platform that's

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,490
the obliquity and in many cases this is

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,280
the platform that's more affordable so

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,140
for a lot of people a computer is one of

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,260
these devices not a laptop not a desktop

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,630
not a server the UK's Office of

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,240
Communications to study in 2015 five

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,940
years after the release of the iPad

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,830
which found a full third of children

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,810
under the age of six owned their own

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,950
tablet I mean they they probably didn't

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,890
earn the money and buy it but they had a

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,000
tablet of their own and so you've got a

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,100
whole generation of kids that are going

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,690
up with that being their mental model

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,070
for a computer and when they become

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,630
interested in programming if they become

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,180
interested in programming or if they

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:27,600
work in a field that we may not call it

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,560
programming but write software I just if

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,150
you've seen what people can do with

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,230
express Excel spreadsheets without

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,260
thinking they're programming it's

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,490
absolutely wild so whatever this next

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,560
generation whatever even our generation

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,090
people who are switching from current

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,830
platforms to these uh these other

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,150
platforms want to learn programming

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,150
they're going to want to reach for a

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:48,450
tool that makes it easy to target those

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,470
devices and so what if you need to

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,280
target all those devices or well if you

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,810
need to target all of the devices and I

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,010
think the only tool that actually goes

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,600
everywhere the only tool actually gets

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,600
you to all the platforms as the web

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,100
so a couple years ago somebody LGU

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,230
woefully misunderstood an instruction to

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:12,840
put windows on a fridge and I look at

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,030
that and I see a bad idea and and maybe

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,710
you see a bad idea but hidden in that

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,020
bad idea is a very good idea or a very

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:22,470
very interesting consequence of the web

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,460
being a universal platform because that

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,470
fridge has the web you have the

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,330
convenience of the entire internet right

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,370
in your kitchen and it's not some

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,710
separate fridge web it's the whole web

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,710
and it's not just LG it's also Samsung

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,380
good god those are fridges connected the

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,140
internet how do you perform a software

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,310
update on that we're gonna have botnets

00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,300
little so I don't know I don't know what

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,840
computers we're gonna use in the future

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,050
I don't know what what platforms five

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,100
years from now we'll seem commonplace

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,050
maybe we'll have smart fridges maybe

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,510
we'll all be wearing some sort of VR

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,060
goggles but what I do know is whatever

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,330
that platform is it will have access to

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,560
content on the web and that's possible

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,030
because the web is built on open

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,040
standards there's no single vendor that

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,330
controls the web and that adds a layer

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,770
of bureaucracy to the web because we

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,390
have to get Mozilla and Microsoft and

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,820
Apple and Google to all agree on on

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,490
where the web is going but that also

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,990
gives the web a certain degree of

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,210
resilience and adaptability that you

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,710
can't find in other platforms so as long

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,940
as the web is competitive as long as

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,500
there's competitive browser market as

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,120
long as we're working on standards and

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,150
coming together at the w3c in the what

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,310
working group then then we can actually

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,510
ensure that the web will go everywhere

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,350
we can predict that this will be the

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:42,000
platform that's Universal and that kind

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,200
of speaks I think to the elephant in the

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,650
room and the Python community which is

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,600
that javascript is surging in popularity

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,610
not because people have heard that it's

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,990
the language designed nearly as well as

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,510
Python but it's surging in popularity

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,850
because the web goes everywhere and with

00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:00,660
the web comes JavaScript and your

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,010
platform determines your tool and you're

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,340
targeting the web and for a long time

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,270
the web was just JavaScript well I don't

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,710
maybe that's what you reach for because

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,850
that makes it easy to start everyone has

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:13,840
a browser maybe we could put Python on

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:21,820
what on the web maybe that could let

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:23,020
yay right maybe that could let us have

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,310
Python everywhere maybe that could let

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,410
us do amazing things that we haven't

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,850
thought of now maybe that could let us

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,110
expand Python into these platforms and

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,160
into these communities that we don't

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,500
currently have representation for I

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,180
don't mean taking Python on the web to

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,040
supplant or a police JavaScript I mean

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,570
putting Python in the web to take the

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,860
best of JavaScript and the best of

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,589
Python and smush them together into

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,120
something that frankly could be amazing

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,200
and you don't have to imagine too hard

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,850
because you can look at something like

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,339
the Jupiter notebooks and realize that

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,720
wait a second this is in part some of

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,730
the best of the web and some of the best

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,650
of Python the notebooks are in your

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,050
browser because your browser is a good

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,460
software platform and the JavaScript

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,650
world has great libraries for doing

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,330
things like interactivity and in GUI

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,410
design and and the web will adapt it

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,820
will work on your fridge and it'll work

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,730
on your phone and it works on your game

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,080
console and everywhere but meanwhile the

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,850
Joker notebook is used to interface with

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,529
other languages especially Python

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,450
because there are also things that

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,089
Python is really good at that JavaScript

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,280
isn't as good at yet data analysis

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,480
scientific computing we're slowly

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,220
working at bringing integers to

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,290
JavaScript there are proposals out there

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,730
but we still don't have them which which

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,900
limits some of the things you can do you

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,310
laugh but I mean the web is the

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,320
universal platform right the web is a

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,970
viable software platform have you ever

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,310
used a web-based email client or Google

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,050
Maps I mean I don't know somehow they

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,580
managed to get by despite Java scripts

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,950
you know what may appear to be flaws not

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,370
having a new Jers probably is a flaw

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,410
we'll fix that

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,600
the syntax might be weird but we'll get

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:57,010
there anyways the cool thing about the

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,360
Jupiter notebook is that that it lets

00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,650
you bring bring these two worlds

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,380
together you get to use Python you get

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,300
to use your browser the thing that's not

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,420
as great is that that Python has to run

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,870
somewhere and it can run on your PC but

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,070
what if you don't have a PC and well

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,420
then you can run it in the cloud and if

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,680
you go to the Jupiter website you can

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,300
you can start and you know try a

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,550
notebook live and it gets hosted by my

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,050
binder which is really wonderful but

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,279
what if you don't have access to a

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,900
reliable network connection or what if

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,750
you're just on an airplane or on a train

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,029
or

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,250
in the middle of the ocean somehow for

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,600
some reason then this amazing

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,240
interactive document turns into

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,310
something that's that's still you know

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,819
well presented and and still logical and

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,459
you can read it but it becomes static

00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:41,750
but if we could bring Python to the web

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,399
then you could put Python the Python

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,600
curl at the Jupiter notebook needs right

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,329
in your browser and then wherever your

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,529
your notebook is so is Python and then

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:51,589
it keeps running it's interactive and

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:54,699
goes wherever the web goes and the way

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:57,589
we can do that is with web assembly I

00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,240
heard someone say yes so so people are

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,379
familiar with this this is new well this

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,649
simply has only been around for about a

00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:06,740
year but what it is is it's a you may

00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:09,319
hear it for two azzam or wasum it's a

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,660
new format for programs on the web it's

00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,920
low level it's binary and it serves as a

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,970
complement to JavaScript because

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,509
JavaScript is a very high-level

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,339
text-based language and most software

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:21,709
ecosystems give developers a choice

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,420
between choosing a high-level language

00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,889
because it's clear and expressive or

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,990
choosing a low-level language because

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,160
you want more manual control or where

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,740
you want other benefits at low level

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,100
languages provide and we do this in

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,809
Python all the time let me explain the

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,910
two reasons that you tend to reach for a

00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:40,670
low-level language are portability or

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,500
performance in the case of performance

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,259
take a library like a or module like

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,870
numpy numpy is designed to deal with

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:49,339
large multi-dimensional arrays and the

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,589
majority of numpy is written in C

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,930
because C is what allows numpy to to

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,699
very efficiently and carefully handle

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,980
how that data is represented in memory

00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:00,889
and how that data is manipulated in

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,500
memory but that C core is wrapped around

00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,970
a Python module and it provides all the

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,139
interface to it so you import numpy and

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,519
you use it just like you would any other

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,290
Python module it doesn't matter and

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,730
you're not aware of the fact that it's

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,129
it's implementing something other than

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,509
Python under the hood it just happens to

00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,610
be really really efficient and really

00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:18,860
really fast

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,300
the other reason aside from you know

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,949
clearing low-level performance or

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,930
clearing performance bottlenecks with a

00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:25,399
low-level language the other reason to

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,889
reach for a low-level language is for

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,920
portability so if you've ever used the

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:32,720
sequel Lite module in Python we didn't

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,309
have to re-implement sequel Lite to

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,019
bring it to Python sequel IDEs written

00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,640
in C and so we could just compile Python

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,770
or compile sequel Lite

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,140
to low level language to a binary that

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,790
Python can then interoperate with

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,470
because most programming languages make

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,310
it very easy to call in between the

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,170
high-level world and the low-level world

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,000
well webassembly does is it brings these

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,950
same options in these same choices in

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,940
that decision between Windows the

00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,620
high-level language of the right tool

00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,740
and whereas the low-level language the

00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:04,700
right tool to the web let me show you

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,350
what that looks like this is a

00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,740
pre-recorded demo because it's a keynote

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:11,510
and I'm not gonna try to type this live

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,980
but this is a small small rust library

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,959
that just calculates a Fibonacci number

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:21,050
I can compile that and get out on a Mac

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,570
because I'm on Mac OS a dot Die Lib file

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,100
and that's kind of like a DLL or an Esso

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,329
if you're on Windows or or likes the

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,150
shared library it's a compiled version

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,980
of my code and because python makes it

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,130
easy to call into a low-level language I

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,560
can write four lines of boilerplate and

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:40,880
then I can call that exact function from

00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,530
Python and it works well this simply

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,950
lets me do and what rust especially

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,450
because rust and C and C++ have have

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,090
good facilities for compiling to web

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,830
assembly is it lets me just change a

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,190
compiler flag and say target this at the

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,350
web and then what I get out is this dot

00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,760
Azzam file and that's a binary and it

00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,840
looks like utter mess if you

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,820
accidentally open it in your text editor

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,280
but that's fine because you feed it to

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,280
the browser four lines of boilerplate

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,780
and what you get out is that same

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,650
function and the ability to call that

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:15,130
same code in your browser so if you have

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,180
a language that can compile to the web

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,440
then you can run it in the web and you

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,460
can run it everywhere the web goes and

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,470
so I was able to take Russ and I was

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,910
able to to write the core of my

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,160
application the core this library in

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,600
rust use it in Python I was they also

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,360
able to compile it web assembly and use

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,810
it on the web and that's kind of

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,540
interesting

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,730
because if you have a compiler then you

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,860
can bring effectively arbitrarily

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,410
complex code from one ecosystem into the

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,840
other at Google i/o this week there was

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,510
an announcement that AutoCAD a 35 year

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,510
old code base I am not yet 35 years old

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:49,670
that code is older than I am was able to

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,990
to run the browser because the the team

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,460
working on it was able to compile it

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,929
into

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,370
assembly and then you can just follow a

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,830
link and there's no software store

00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,600
there's no new installation process

00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,710
there's no oh what sort of platform are

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,010
you on you just follow a link and you

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,320
can have access to this you know

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,909
stalwart venerable I don't actually I've

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,799
never used computer-aided design but I

00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:10,510
hear autocad's a big deal and now it's

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:16,419
in your browser and that means it can

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:17,529
also be on your fridge so if you've been

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:20,020
around the Python community you've

00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:22,059
probably heard of Gary Bernhardt stalk

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,309
from Python 2014 the birth and death of

00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,880
JavaScript if you haven't watched the

00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:30,970
talk you should go watch it if you watch

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,820
the talk during PyCon 2014 or shortly

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,350
thereafter you probably left the room

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,980
thinking wow Gary's a great entertainer

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,210
and he's a good speaker if you go back

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,380
and watch that talk today you start

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,940
feeling a little uncomfortable because

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,279
you realize that gary kind of kind of

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,200
force all of this because well gary gary

00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,340
talked about in that that presentation

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,840
was imagining a world where the web has

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,600
won and the web is this universal

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,190
platform the web is programmable and he

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,419
hypothesized that one day maybe we'll

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,970
take something like the Windows version

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,140
of the editing suite and run that

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,010
inside the Mac version of Chrome which

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,730
of course would be running inside the

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,899
Mac version of Firefox and everyone

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,039
laughed because there's no way that

00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:11,039
could ever actually happen

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:22,620
so I can't I can't do that for you but

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:27,900
but wait wait wait let me uh take a

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:33,020
second a bit so so this is Windows

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,020
Windows 3 and this is an escape

00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:41,000
hello netscape netscape netscape is why

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,380
we have Firefox today because as part of

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,570
as pardon Netscape losing the browser

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,460
wars as part of their their kind of

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,029
last-ditch Hail Mary as they said Lori

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,380
let's instead of facing down Microsoft

00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,480
with 100 of us versus a thousand of them

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,620
if we release the source code behind

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,120
Netscape maybe maybe that could be the

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,679
world against Microsoft maybe we could

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,409
still have a competitive web and that's

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,019
what became Mozilla that's what we came

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:10,460
Firefox and so what's amazing is you can

00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,610
you can look at this code this was a

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,570
version of Netscape from 1996 there are

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,289
people in this room that are younger

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,370
than this browser and it still looks and

00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:21,019
feels like the web the web is this

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,879
Universal platform and it turns out this

00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:29,860
browser is currently running inside

00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:29,860
Firefox mm-hmm right there

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,130
and so to be true to Gary is a giri's

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,540
memory I could go and launch paint but

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:44,580
it's the version of painting Windows 3

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:46,440
is not good but we can we can start

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,030
treating the computer or structuring the

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,510
web like a computer because well this is

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,680
what gives us low-level capabilities and

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,880
I can give you a link to this so you can

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,230
run it in your own browser in fact the

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,610
Internet Archive is doing just this the

00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,740
Internet Archive has a software library

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,720
we can go and run all these old dos and

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,890
Mac games and utilities and things like

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,150
that right in your browser but the web's

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,970
also really capable because what you can

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,680
do is you can also take that same same

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,230
emulator so what's happened is I've

00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,180
taken daus box and I've compiled DOSBox

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,550
to webassembly then on top of DOS box in

00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,780
my browser I'm running unmodified

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,930
windows three and then unmodified

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,040
Netscape three but you can also start

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,680
mashing this stuff with other things the

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,970
web can do and a lot of us who have been

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,520
around software for a while still think

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,050
of the web in ways that that were kind

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,760
of ossified in the era of Netscape

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,990
Navigator 3 and for me think of it as a

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,700
document platform when you think of it

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:40,200
as being flat and text-based but the web

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,580
supports 3d and the web supports virtual

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,650
reality so you can also go and take this

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,700
and paint it onto it as a texture in a

00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,350
3d environment and if you visit this on

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,850
your phone the web goes to your phone so

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,900
that also works and you can actually use

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,250
your accelerometer and hold your phone

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,330
up and look around the room and pretend

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:59,100
like you're programming in a basement in

00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:02,300
the 90's and credit where credit's do

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:06,860
this is a demo by James by Keanu of

00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:11,220
Janus VR and he posted this on Twitter

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,330
over a year ago and it's still one of

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,440
the coolest things I've ever seen done

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,420
with whether simply I don't think it's

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,560
enough enough attention that you can you

00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,030
can really use your browser and you

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,390
could really use the web as a computing

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,680
platform can I do it anywhere and the

00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,560
answer is yes this is a screenshot I

00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,980
took last year when edge and Safari edge

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,620
and Safari both on iOS and on max turned

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,750
whether simply on by default web

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,910
assembly is everywhere whether simply as

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:41,690
part of the web today so can we just

00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:46,280
compile Python to the web and be done

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,280
I'm sorry somebody's like yeah

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,590
not quite not quite so well this

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,510
somebody's really basically it

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,180
effectively gives you a virtual CPU

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,960
inside your browser and all the CPU

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,890
really understands as numbers in memory

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,570
and that's cool because that's really

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,780
all any CPU understands and so you can

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,460
you can build up these abstractions on

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,380
top of that you can if you need a string

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,880
you can say alright well it's gonna be

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,320
memory starting here going until the

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,270
memory is zero or whatever else we do

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,310
that all the time that's how computers

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,420
work but the other thing that's

00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,830
interesting that wealth assembly is that

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,890
it's actually running inside your

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,030
browser's JavaScript engine and your

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,220
browser's responsible for taking web

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,420
some way and converting it down very

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,430
quickly and efficiently but still

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,020
converting it to native code for

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,720
whatever actual CPU is inside your

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,010
device and because this is happening

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,990
because this is happening inside kind of

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,530
the JavaScript sandbox that means that

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,480
webassembly

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,010
only has access to things that the web

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,660
would have access to and the web has

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,620
access to a lot of things we had the we

00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:47,390
had web VR we have WebGL but it does

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,040
mean that webassembly apps can't read

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,740
and write arbitrary files on your PC it

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,360
can't read random parts of memory it's

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,460
single threaded you can't open a raw

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,520
network socket so it's still just as

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,170
safe as as JavaScript it's just you can

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,330
now treat the web like a compilation

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:06,950
target okay I lied you can't actually

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:11,180
compile Python to the web so so this is

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,340
pipe ijs a colleague of mine prison this

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,050
app icon a few years back unfortunately

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,040
the project is now defunct but but what

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:22,370
pipe ijs was was he took pi PI

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:24,710
individual Ryan Kelly and he he compiled

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,370
that to a predecessor of whether simply

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,110
called as JSA SMAS and the funny thing

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,850
about pi pi is that pi pi is really good

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,410
at certain types of tasks and so if you

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,090
run the pi stone benchmark and you can

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,490
go to pi pi j org right now and do this

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,490
and yourself in your browser on my

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:43,060
laptop in my browser i've been talking

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,940
about 300,000 of these things a second

00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:51,590
if i do that natively on my computer of

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:53,600
course it's not faster pi pi j s in my

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,600
browser is actually about twice as fast

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,130
as real c python on my laptop natively

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,610
and that's not a fair comparison because

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,610
it's too

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,200
different pythons pie-pie versus cpython

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,970
but it does still still make the point

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,040
that it is possible to bring all of

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,380
python to the web it's not horribly slow

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,110
and it's not horribly incompatible the

00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,750
problem is it's also not very webby pipe

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:17,090
ijs is a is a really amazing demo but

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,559
it's also this big six megabyte binary

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,230
file effectively you have to download

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,140
and run and and that's not how the web

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,929
works six megabytes is a really high

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,160
price to pay if you're trying or is a

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:28,940
high price way it may make sense if

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,230
you're trying to do something like a

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,840
Jupiter notebook where you want all the

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,370
Python in your browser but it's too

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,020
large a cost to pay if you want

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,410
something just like Python syntax for

00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,580
list comprehensions and so we need to

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,710
find some sort of way if we're going to

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,480
make if we're going to agree or if I'm

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,429
going to convince you that the web is a

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,590
valuable platform for Python to target

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,000
then we need to find ways to to work

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,500
alongside the web and use the web's

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,240
native capabilities for what they're

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,110
good at and use Python for what pythons

00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:01,090
good at there's no sense of reinventing

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,090
the web we've got a good web it's here

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,669
one of the consequences of the platform

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:11,780
you're targeting dictating the tool that

00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:15,169
you use is that for many people the web

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,280
is the platform today and for the

00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,690
majority of the web's existence

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,250
javascript has been the only language

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,850
the only tool available on that platform

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,679
and and that's good in that we owe

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,970
JavaScript for the viability of the web

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,410
as a platform at all javascript is the

00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,850
language that went everywhere and

00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,770
there's really amazing work being done

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,200
in javascript in terms of library design

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:36,290
in terms of especially in terms of

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,110
front-end engineering and javascript may

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:42,679
not have had the same breath as Python

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,730
Python but in time if if I'm right at

00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:45,500
predicting that the web is this

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,179
Universal platform if the writing is on

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,309
the wall that this is the one platform

00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:52,010
that goes everywhere then in time the

00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,059
web will take take on those other tasks

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,470
and those other responsibilities and

00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:56,990
other capabilities that it doesn't have

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,030
right now but that also means that

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,830
Python has a lot to offer to the web in

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,299
Python we're the second best language

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,160
for anything we have a module for

00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:07,460
anything you could possibly want to do

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,900
in Python scientific competing isn't

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,230
very big in JavaScript but it's a

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,460
massive subfield of the Python community

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,360
and that's something we can bring to the

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,150
web and that's something we could

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,000
contribute back but more than that I

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,669
think I think the Python the community

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,290
ethos is something that every program

00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:26,750
programming language could benefit from

00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,830
because when you're a part of the Python

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,929
community you're part of a community

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,370
that hears about the human behind the

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:32,960
keyboard both personally and also in the

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,600
software right we we care about

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,150
ergonomics we care about clarity we have

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,950
the zone of Python that's it's important

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,320
languages other than Python don't have

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,000
that same some kind of clarion call to

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,150
say we're writing this software and

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,590
we're building these tools for humans

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,540
we're pragmatic we write documentation

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:54,200
Python is powerful Python has a lot to

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,549
offer and so what's new isn't that isn't

00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,110
that pythons going to take over the web

00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:01,220
and and I'd argue that actually be bad

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,270
because we all benefit by I just look at

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,530
the Python community benefit by

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,620
expanding the people they're here we

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,240
benefit by by going to more places but

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,610
what's new is that the web is JavaScript

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,270
and the possibility of other languages

00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,669
and if we do this in a way that lets us

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:18,410
leverage the best of both then that

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:19,970
elevates both Python and JavaScript and

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,010
that ensures that Python stays relevant

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,970
no matter what platforms the future

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:27,950
holds the trick is figuring out how to

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,540
do it how do we bring real Python to a

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,500
webinar in the way to the web in a way

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,570
that makes sense for the web I don't

00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,580
know we have there's there's some

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,580
experience or some prior prior examples

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,020
we can look at but all I'm certain of is

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,970
that we have the tools we need we have

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,549
the pieces we need the potential is here

00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:51,080
the potential is real but it's uncharted

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:54,200
territory waiting to be explored maybe

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,470
that's where you come in thank you so

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,710
much welcome to PyCon I'll see you on

00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,710
the web
