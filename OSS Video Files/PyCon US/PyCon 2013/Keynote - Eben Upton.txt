you guys see it my name is Evan Upton I

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,010
run out I run a thing based in the UK

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,900
called the Raspberry Pi foundation we

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,719
make little computers for kids now

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,250
normally I try to avoid inflicting death

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,550
by PowerPoint on people but we were so

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,590
close

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,880
yesterday was pi day so I really

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,949
couldn't I really couldn't resist doing

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:30,960
a moderately are what are we going to do

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:42,950
here damnation this wouldn't have

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:42,950
happened with the Raspberry Pi yeah

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,719
little bit

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:55,379
there will be a short pause possibly a

00:00:48,719 --> 00:01:00,420
long but so look see so it's thinking

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:05,790
ten ten by seven can you toggle it to

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:13,049
the main screen I'll see what happens is

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:16,110
it good we get understanding back to the

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,759
presentation so so I couldn't I couldn't

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,070
resist doing a moderately Pi theme talk

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,950
a talk phone themed around everyone's

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,619
favorite irrational number so what I'm

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,020
going to try and do Spotify talking

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,490
about warm I'd like to talk to you a few

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,009
a few minutes about what Raspberry Pi is

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,920
it's like one big story what raspberry

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,320
pie is why we're doing it for me

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,299
Raspberry Pi has been a about a seven

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,820
year journey now starting with my time

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,079
as what we call the director of studies

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,470
at the University in Cambridge now the

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,740
role of a director of studies is to is

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,920
to organize the undergraduate teaching

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,810
for a subject at one of our 30 colleges

00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,299
and also to ensure a supply of

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,180
undergraduates in the future so every

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,130
December we get a lot of high school

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,890
students come in we used to be a lot of

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,560
high school students come in to apply

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,080
for our places on our course now

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,790
I went to Cambridge in 1996 we had a

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,830
fairly typical oversubscription ratio of

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,239
about six to one so in order to get a

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,430
place on the computer science try pasty

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,340
you had to beat your way through you had

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,050
to beat out five other guys and those

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,670
are those five other guys they were

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,349
often people who had a very very deep

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,340
level of understanding of what computers

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,750
did these are people who have been

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,790
programming maybe since they were 10

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,099
people who'd have their Commodore 64's

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,540
or their time axes or in the UK machines

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,630
like the BBC microcomputer which is

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,069
certainly what I grew up with these are

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,989
people who maybe have bought these

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,580
machines as children to play computer

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,870
games on well they built they bought

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,700
these they've been bought these machines

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,040
by their parents to do their school work

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,690
on but all of these machines had one

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,459
thing in common and that was that when

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,680
you turn them on they went beep well

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,849
mine went beep and they give you a

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
programming prompt and the first thing

00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,489
you had to do if you wanted to play

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,569
games on these machines or you wanted to

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,920
start a word processor and do your

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,200
schoolwork the first thing you've had to

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,000
choose to do was to choose not to

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,400
program the computer but what this meant

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,440
was that everybody of my age in the UK

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,630
who had any aptitude for computing or

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,370
any interest in computing had a chance

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,140
to discover that they had that interest

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,549
and they had a platform generally in

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,709
their bedrooms that they could hack on

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,420
for many hours and night that they could

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,950
use to develop those skills and what

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,390
this meant was that virtually everybody

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,400
I knew at school at least knew how to

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,910
write these that two-line program 10:00

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,130
print I am the best 20 go to 10 or or

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,480
something a lot filthy and then to go in

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,470
there then to go into the local computer

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,819
store and type it into all of the

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,540
machines and then hit enter on all the

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,709
machines and run out the door

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,640
it was a simple time in the nineteen

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,560
eighties you know we used to make our

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,599
own entertainment and the upshot of this

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,370
was that the University in Cambridge

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,680
should we've got fat and happy on this

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,290
this stream of incredibly intelligent

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,049
incredibly talented kids who came in the

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,180
door at the age of 18 the cambridge

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,579
course is fairly famous for for having

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,019
very short terms you know the the the

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,730
pep of the university in the UK the less

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,079
time you actually spend there what this

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,840
means is over the course of three years

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,400
we have 60 weeks of contact time to turn

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,010
you from a high school student into

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,500
somebody who can start an english three

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,090
PhD program that meant it was extremely

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,590
useful to us to be able to rely on a

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,850
certain level of ability and a certain

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,289
level of knowledge when people came in

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,430
the door and in fact the first thing we

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,840
had to do with a lot of these kids was

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,090
to convince them that they didn't know

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,530
everything we have a fantastic tool

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,479
called functional programming standard

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:37,400
ml for doing this

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:38,960
language Wars and so we beat these kids

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,340
and I was one of these kids with kids

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,479
we've beaten over the head for the first

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,639
eight weeks of this course and when that

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,110
lying on the floor whimpering then you

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,340
know we can then start to teach them the

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,060
things they need to know now by the time

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:58,100
people absolutely need to know

00:04:50,060 --> 00:05:00,380
functional programming so so we by the

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,740
time I was I'd went through the ph.d

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,930
program and by the time I was

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,030
interviewing people in 2005 the picture

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,310
had changed radically so we've gone from

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:14,750
having 500 applicants for our 80 or 90

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:17,750
places to having more like 200 to 250 I

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,010
was still a reasonable ratio

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,360
we've start to get a little bit slim it

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,789
was starting to look like we might not

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,770
be able to find I 80 or 90 kids and what

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,139
we were still able into this day we can

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,180
find 80 or 90 people to come and study

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,729
on the course who are every bit as

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,979
intelligent as those people were back in

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:37,430
the mid 1990s what they lack these days

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:39,349
is they lack that built-in kind of

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,419
hacker knowledge of what the machine is

00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,190
doing so we have to spend quite a lot of

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,590
the start of our 60 weeks building these

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,530
people up to a level that we that we'd

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:51,380
previously been able to assume so back

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,620
in 2006 a group of us at the University

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,060
started to wonder why this had happened

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,680
and we started to wonder if there was

00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,320
something we could do about it and the

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,760
theory that we came up with was that

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,320
what was that what had happened what's

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,449
those 8-bit machines that we all have as

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,550
children have gone away that that

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,440
ecosystem had been eaten from below by

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,690
games consoles games consoles are not

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,639
only not programmable they are designed

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,830
to not be programmable their business

00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,180
model forces them to be on programmable

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,770
piece of hardware because the platform

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,630
holder needs to recover the subsidy that

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,039
they've applied to the platform and then

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,930
they've been eaten from above by the PC

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,669
now the PC is an awesomely program abuse

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,260
of power it's as a programming

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,180
environment far more sophisticated and

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,220
user-friendly than the machines that we

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,599
used to in the 1980s what had changed

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,510
was the choice architecture what had

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,250
changed was if you get a PC you have to

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,510
choose to program the PC you have to

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,469
choose to go and get the tools you have

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,389
to choose to go and get the

00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:43,460
documentation and that's a tiny little

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,569
energy barrier but it's a big enough

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,869
energy barrier that it just

00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:51,469
chop the legs of our pipeline of skilled

00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:53,360
applicants so we thought well there's a

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:54,919
niche maybe we can make a thing to fit

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,629
in this niche and we have an idea that

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,669
the thing to fit in this niche in kids

00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,779
bedrooms had to be four things first of

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,309
all it obviously it had to be

00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,770
programmable to be of any use to us

00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:05,990
secondly it had to be interesting we had

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,969
to remember that kids were buying these

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,020
kids were buying these machines the 90s

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,879
it so I bought my machine in the

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,409
nineteen eighties to play live what my

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,119
computer program on but a lot of people

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,559
bought their computers in order to play

00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,509
games on will do their schoolwork on so

00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,159
had to be able to do something else it

00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,899
had to not just be a programming device

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,430
and for us what that meant interesting

00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,289
meant games interesting meant graphics

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,629
interesting meant video

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,279
it had to be robust we wanted something

00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,659
that was small and robust something

00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,830
could be shoved into a school bag and

00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,110
taken out of a school bag a hundred

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,659
times the mob break and finally we want

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,889
to dab some hooch was cheap now we were

00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,629
aware that we were going to be asking

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,949
people to go and buy a particular piece

00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,330
of hardware in order to get this pro

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,519
experience therefore we couldn't we just

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,809
could not make it expensive we looked

00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,979
around at our idea of cheaper which is

00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,569
well a school textbook you can ask

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,699
children to buy school textbooks now

00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,959
that just shows some we pick this $25

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,189
price which shows that we know nothing

00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,189
about what textbooks cost

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,809
I think if we if we had had a more

00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:00,279
accurate understanding of what textbooks

00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,509
cost then we would had a much easier job

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,139
of the engineering over the following

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:07,899
few years and so we set to it pretty

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,459
much this $25 $25 came before anything

00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,779
else that $25 is the price of the

00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,479
cheapest Raspberry Pi of what we call

00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:14,919
the model a Raspberry Pi $25.00 came

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,050
before pretty much anything else and

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,309
we've spent a long time playing around

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,139
trying to find out what we could fit

00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,580
into $25 and the first things we were

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,779
building were very very similar to

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,729
Arduino this which I'm sure a lot of

00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,889
people in the room have used based on

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,999
microcontrollers you can get a really

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,309
nice you can actually trick a

00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,659
microcontroller into driving a old

00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:34,620
standard definition television so you

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,940
can get a really nice sort of 8-bit

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,919
microcomputer experience out of an

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,319
atmega an atmel atmega microcontroller

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,430
but this failed the number of our tests

00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,569
and the lovely thing about this was and

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,709
I built one of these myself the lovely

00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:46,180
thing about these platforms is that you

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,709
can build them yourself on Vera board

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,880
you know you can sit down on a rainy

00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:52,029
afternoon at the end the afternoon you

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,709
walk away with a computer the under

00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,420
certainly meets for the $25 gold what it

00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,160
doesn't need is this requirement that it

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,899
should be interesting to children right

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,040
it's interesting to me because I already

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,720
know how to program I like you know

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,759
geeky toys but it has to be interesting

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,029
to children so we kind of abandoned that

00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,199
idea about this time I went to work for

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,699
a company called Broadcom and if I do

00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,959
still I'm still a salaried employee of

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:14,199
broad Carmel I spend most of my time

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,310
doing this sort of thing there but what

00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,589
I went to work for him to go Broadcom

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,149
Broadcom makes a lot of different chips

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,610
for communication stuff and one of the

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:23,649
things that we make is certain chips for

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,600
chips for cell phones and it turns out I

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,370
was struck by and these cost about the

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,040
same as microcontrollers and I was

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,470
struck that if you are a cellphone

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,670
company what you're $10 will buy you is

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,750
very different from what you're ten

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,009
dollars will buy you if you're going to

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,959
dedicate in the way of in the way of

00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,519
processing capability and so this group

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,660
of us we started to look and we started

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,319
to see whether we could build something

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,389
on one of these platforms in about 2008

00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:48,370
we had in our hands based on a mobile

00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,680
phone graphics processor that we

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,709
developed in Cambridge we had a device

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,259
which we thought was almost good enough

00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,209
this was the device which didn't have a

00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:00,910
an open processor it had a closed

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:04,000
proprietary risk core on it but we put

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,079
this cpython too and so we had the thing

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,420
that we thought we wanted all along

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,970
which was a machine booted into

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,170
a printer or a widely known popular

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,360
educational programming language in this

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,280
case Python and this thing just looks

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,470
great you're not $25 price point it

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,910
could play 720p video and have a nice

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,040
powerful graphics processor on it we'd

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,960
we'd arranged Python bindings for all of

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,060
these features it was really fantastic a

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,290
little platform and you know we really

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,320
thought this was a go and so this group

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,610
of us had been doing this informally got

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,890
together and we said well let's let's

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,720
set up a foundation to promote this and

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,310
we kicked around a lot of names we came

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,640
up with this named Raspberry Pi in the

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,700
end the pie in the pie in Raspberry Pi

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,620
is the ply in Python misspelt so I've

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,680
had to defend my spelling for the last

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,910
four and a half years we really really

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,410
thought that Pi was gonna be for a

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,610
fantastic logo and we have never ever

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,050
used that we've never used that

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,280
possibility but by the time we realized

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,650
we weren't going to do that we'd frozen

00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,060
the layman so so we were and we were

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,820
traveling along but one of the problems

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,200
I think we found was that we had to

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,480
write everything ourselves this was a

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,870
very closed platform okay we ported an

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,070
open well known popular interpretive

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,390
language onto it but we had to write

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,740
everything ourselves we had to Runner

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,630
and network drivers on our own sd card

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,460
drivers and all this stuff and so it

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,170
wasn't quite there and then we were very

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,670
lucky that a couple of years later a

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,350
version of broadly the same chip

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,520
appeared that I had managed to cram an

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,810
arm 11 into the corner off their

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,050
advantages to being on the chip design

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,050
team

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,739
we absolutely must have an arm 11 in

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:40,839
this chip for unspecified business

00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:44,230
reasons and we got this chip back and it

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,579
was great and we finally have the thing

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,230
that we wanted which was like which was

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,549
an almost completely at least on the arm

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,379
side had completely over backflips and

00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,730
they could run Linux right and that

00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:54,009
would mean that we could leverage this

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,769
enormous investment that the community

00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,480
had made in developing a real offer a

00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:02,079
real a real operating system you have to

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,579
pay money for and but we were still

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
thinking in a very parochial way we

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,009
started this very parochial idea that

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,410
what we're going to try and do was get

00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:09,670
our what we don't want another 250 could

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,279
be the science Africans the Cambridge a

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,809
year that was our dream 250 could be of

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,459
science a provincia and maybe for the 80

00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,749
or 90 we let in to know a little bit of

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,220
assembly language that would have been a

00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:20,799
really great outcome

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,639
and because we're very nostalgic I don't

00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,629
know how many of you have come across

00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,410
some machine called the BBC

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,730
microcomputer this was the the

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,829
educational microcomputer of choice in

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,119
the UK in the 1980s sponsored by the

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,129
British Broadcasting Corporation and

00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,929
because a number of us on the boards of

00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:37,209
the foundation had a history with the

00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:38,470
BBC micro kind of like romantic guys we

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,669
thought it would be kind of cool to put

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,350
a BBC sticker on it well they call the

00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,850
BBC nano we have this lovely brand with

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,639
raspberry pi that we've never ever ever

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,110
wanted and we thought would be great if

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,179
we could call this a BBC nano we kept

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,449
going to the BBC and asking them could

00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:53,799
we give me a stick you stick your leg on

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,299
this and they kept saying no and there

00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,799
are various complicated legal reasons

00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,679
why they have to say no and our last

00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,989
attempt was in May of 2011 so nearly two

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,999
years ago we went to see a guy called

00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,799
Rory Catherine Jones who's the senior

00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,480
technology correspondent for the BBC and

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,869
we said hey can we put the BBC leg on he

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,869
said no

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,970
but what in what he what he didn't say

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,490
then was well I think it's a great idea

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,380
though can I take a video of one of you

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,029
holding up a prototype and talking about

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,500
the talking about the idea and so one of

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:23,060
my colleagues that I call David Braben

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,990
one of my fellow trustees who any of

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,180
you've played the computer game you'll

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,779
eat we've had thousands wasted by elite

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,519
so that's David's fault there's a 45

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,870
second video of him just standing up

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
holding something looks nothing like a

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,290
Raspberry Pi and talking about the

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,810
Raspberry Pi project build 600,000

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,339
YouTube views in two days and that was a

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,870
great two days to me I sat there and

00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:46,819
Broadcom at work I didn't do any work I

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:49,279
just started pressing f5 you've seen the

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:51,470
episodes about home against his console

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,120
at home and replaces his entire function

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,920
blows modding birds and I was just

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,449
pressing at 5:00 am i how popular you

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,279
counter was going up and I was feeling

00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,779
great and at the end of the second day I

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,149
went home and I was really buzzing and I

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,790
sat down opposite my wife my wife Lyz I

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,690
sat down opposite and we have this for

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,910
dinner and we have this sudden motion

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,709
moment where we realized we'd promised

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,999
600,000 people we build them a $25

00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:15,980
computer we have no idea how to do

00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:18,910
and so we spend a lot of 2011 for me was

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,959
just like one storm of trying to try to

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,009
figure out how we were first of all how

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,929
we were just going to do it at the price

00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,489
you know we you you add up the cost from

00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,139
the chips and it should be about right

00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,549
but as soon as you start you know

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,759
they're 180 components on the Raspberry

00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,649
Pi

00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,759
two of those are the chips and those are

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,419
the ones that I was thinking of when I

00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,439
was thinking you're twenty-four

00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:34,939
twenty-five dollars there's a lot of

00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,619
one-cent components and two-cent

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,149
components and some 10 cent components

00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:39,980
on that board and that can really add up

00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:41,329
so we spent a long time trying to figure

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,759
out how to fight our way down to

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,319
anywhere near $25 or $35 for the one

00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,379
that we launched which has Ethernet and

00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:50,899
more usb on it towards the end of the

00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:53,660
year we actually have something we

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,980
thought we could build a cost and this

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,889
was this one testing we thought about

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,970
600,000 people and we thought well most

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,629
of those rubberneckers they don't

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,799
actually want to run for pi so what

00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,329
we'll do we've got a brilliant business

00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,769
model I'll I just finished my MBA so I

00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,269
knew all bad business mumbles I thought

00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,499
you're a great business model

00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:11,269
well dudes I'll scrape together some

00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:13,759
cash and we scrape together a quarter

00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,619
million dollars of capital to run this

00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,089
project and I still have to build 10,000

00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:19,639
raspberry pies and so what might this is

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:22,459
whatever small build 10,000 raspberry

00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,169
pies we will put them on a website like

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,579
Oh some sort of shop store thing people

00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,749
buy them and then after a few months

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,459
we'll have run out of our 10,000

00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:29,689
raspberry pies and I will go and get the

00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:31,129
money that we got back and we'll use in

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,829
to buy some more up to built-in lottery

00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:35,600
prize I'll be great and then we have a

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,069
really unfortunate we within but we

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,809
would start to get these danger signals

00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,160
you know the traffic to our website was

00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,459
creeping up and the number of people on

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,220
our forums as creeping up and to keep

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,779
people interested we this thing boots

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,689
from an SD card right so we put an SD

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,220
card image online for people to download

00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:53,629
just have a look out really buggy early

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,149
beater software a bit of firmware I

00:15:53,629 --> 00:16:00,199
think you could be computed in qmu

00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:01,279
and we have 50,000 downloads of that and

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,470
that was the point where we realized

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,389
that the pool of fans so hardcore they

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,650
would download a buggy alpha operating

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,630
system

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,500
for a computer that they didn't know

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,180
when they were going to get veiled to

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,440
get in that didn't exist yet was 50,000

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,270
people and then we thought you know are

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,890
10,000 years one only lasts a week you

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,110
know now we're and it takes three months

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,640
to make so we'd be screwed and then we

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,560
were very lucky because we found two

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,060
companies in the UK the company called

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,770
premier Farnell and the company called

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,520
RS Components and they trade out here as

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:30,890
Newark and allied so two very large

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,480
component distributors who have shared

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,740
our concern they have the city of their

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,760
customers our engineers they have an

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,950
interest in there being a strong

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,720
engineering base in our country and so

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,700
they had the same concerns as us and

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,770
because they have these concerns they

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,570
were prepared to help us out not simply

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,460
by distributing these things Bob our

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,810
manufacturing own florists so they were

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,710
prepared to provide the capital they

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,120
were prepared to provide for the

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,980
logistics in the first line customer

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,320
support and so we turned ourselves in

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,150
January of last year in the two months

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,070
before in the two months before launch

00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,300
we turned ourselves from a very capital

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,830
constrained little foundation that was

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,990
trying to build things into an IP

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,100
licensing company so we own the design

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,810
of the board and we own the lot of the

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,490
brand and we license those to these two

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,960
companies and they do the heavy lifting

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,610
and that's what's enabled us to that's

00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,690
what enabled us to scale we were very

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,570
lucky we did this because we took a

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,760
hundred thousand orders on the first day

00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,710
so the answer to our question walls 15

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,030
minutes

00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:25,940
which was which was nice so we're we're

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,890
here in we've sold a billion we sold a

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,100
million family reports on point last

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,100
month

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,570
I'll pretend that that's what my number

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,130
1 stands for so oh there we go this bit

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,049
of theme hard I'll pretend that number 1

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,330
stands for what millennia it's old so

00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:47,830
it's been an incredible year and one of

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,659
the wonderful things about this year has

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,280
been that for the first six months to a

00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,250
year of this project our website largely

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,690
documented stuff we were doing opted to

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,980
get this device out of the door and for

00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,409
the next six to nine months what they

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,710
documented was what people like us would

00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:04,419
do people adults who already have a

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,559
knowledge of computers are doing one of

00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,030
the really wonderful things over the

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,860
past six months of our three to six

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,270
months is that the character the

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,330
submissions we get to our website is

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,159
changing so the character of the the

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,960
submissions we care is changing to be as

00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,350
much about what children are doing with

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,460
the pie as it is about what as is about

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,840
what adults doing with the pine that's a

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:29,409
really good sign so I'm going to inflict

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:33,640
on you can I have the slide deck back 15

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:35,260
ish cool pictures of stuff that I I

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,049
wasn't able to keep myself to 15 but

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,049
I'll be very quick projects people do

00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:42,070
with this things we never expected one

00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,799
of the interesting things about the pie

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,120
is I'm a graphics hacker I have seen

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,890
what people would rise graphics demos on

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,850
this holiday anyone has written graphics

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,809
Timmers although if there are graphics

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,340
hackers in the room please do write

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,590
graphics demos on the pie make me happy

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,760
but almost everything people have done

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,049
with the pie has been stuff that I

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,880
wouldn't have seen coming so one of the

00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:59,950
wonderful ones here there's a great

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,610
platform for doing music this is a mode

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:08,409
like a free mode like digital analog

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:10,330
synth that you can download called name

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:12,250
has flown out of my brain but it's out

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,980
there raspberry pie synthesizer dot blog

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,030
spot.com there there's an enormous

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,030
overlap not just

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,920
so it turns out there's a big overlap

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,150
between people who like computer

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,150
computer programming and people who like

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,340
you would not believe the number of

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,390
people whose first reaction no Jessi

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,170
challenged she did sort of think of

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,790
something to do with your Raspberry Pi

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,560
you don't believe the number of people

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,570
who rise to that challenge by using it

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,460
to control their brewery whether that is

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,100
a little home Michael home brewing

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,210
station or a proper micro brewery and

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,800
there was a thing called brew pie

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,080
there's an open platform based on I

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,000
believe it's based on Python and Arduino

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,670
and Raspberry Pi I think called brew pie

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,290
which is a completely fully integrated

00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,290
micro brewery national system running on

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,310
photography this one that's why I

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,970
enjoyed there's this nice if you want to

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:09,980
get really crisp macro macro photos on

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,420
from your camera there's this process

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,200
called focus stacking where you step

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,370
your camera towards the towards the the

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,690
image and then stack up and then

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,280
basically find the bits that are in

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,200
focus in each image and combine them

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,850
together usually you have to buy like a

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,080
grams worth of hardware to do this this

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,390
is a nice bit of focus stacking done

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,130
using an old flatbed scanner and they

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,010
raspberry pie and a camera so that was

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,150
quite cute games yeah

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,680
there's an enormous retro gaming

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,450
community under arthropods Rugby flies

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,330
just about powerful enough to emulate

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,580
that era of computers that I grew up

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,990
with and the air of the first era of

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,730
consoles that I complained about that

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:48,160
that destroyed the era of computers like

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,660
rather like this one Super Nintendo damn

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,620
okay well I think I just put this one in

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,150
because this to this is this is

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,770
incredibly cute is this is a lot of

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,050
little little paper but I don't think

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,570
that paper they must be plastic boats on

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,980
the Thames there's a dock on the Thames

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,600
this is Canary Wharf where a lot of our

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,270
financial services are in the UK and

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,560
there's this little ribbon of boats out

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,180
there that you can tell you I think you

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,610
can text to it and it will it will

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,290
change colour but this sort of art

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,920
installations seem to be a big thing

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,640
with raspberry pi this is my favorite

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,070
one

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,370
it's Doctor Who and space and the

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,750
Raspberry Pi all-in-one

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,460
there's a gentleman called a vitamin who

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,980
I met for the first time I thought on on

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,720
Thursday night but I've known about it

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,060
for a long time he does a good line in

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,040
putting cameras on the weather balloons

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,540
and sending them up to sort of 40

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,370
kilometres up and taking pictures he

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,990
used to do this with little little

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,720
camcorders and digital still cameras

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,920
about a year ago just after launch he

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
started doing this from the pine he's

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,620
got these wonderful pictures of the

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,970
earth from 40 kilometres up and then he

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,980
does more and more incredible stuff like

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,080
a sending up a little polystyrene TARDIS

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,450
at the same time what's wonderful about

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,300
this though is this is this puts a spate

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,770
program within the budgetary reach of

00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,770
every primary school in the world

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,520
and I I defy any child maybe and maybe

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,560
it's maybe I'm a child of my own garbage

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,420
child of my time but I defy any child

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,440
not to be interested in science

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,220
technology engineering and mathematics

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,500
when they can put a TARDIS in space we

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,750
have magazines like in the 1980s with

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:27,730
typing listings like in the 1980s type

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:28,960
in Python listings I mean something

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,680
about there's something about that loop

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,150
where you know the Internet is is

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,620
fantastic in a lot of ways the web it's

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,120
fantastic in a lot of ways for helping

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,790
people learn to program I remember as a

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,190
child wanting to having played elite I

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,600
remember wanting to write a little 3d

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,620
game wanted build draw lines

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,090
I knew there was a thing called

00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,280
bresenhem's algorithm you could use to

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,050
draw lines and my father's a professor

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,700
at the University in New York and so I

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,170
had access to university library could I

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:58,960
find out what bresenham's algorithm was

00:22:53,170 --> 00:23:00,130
could I hell now I find out presents I

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,290
don't know typing bresenham's algorithm

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,720
into Google but one of the wonderful

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,280
things about typing something in there

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
supposed to download it from the web is

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,160
there is some sort of feeling that it

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,210
goes through your eyes and into your

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,340
brain and out of your fingers and

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,930
somehow you own this more than something

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,160
that you've just downloaded and run and

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,960
generally when you type it in you will

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,400
make a mistake and you will therefore

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,070
let you and you'll have a you have a

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,100
learning opportunity I remember those

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,810
learning opportunities in 1980s so we

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,660
have this is a free magazine called the

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:31,150
magpie Lyme because I'm hoping we're

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,650
going to get print magazines this one is

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,820
actually this one was an e-magazine for

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,530
the first eight issues it comes out

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,730
every month but it's just transitioned

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,210
to being a print magnet you can actually

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,290
buy a subscription for we have books

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:45,940
those of you I don't know if you have

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:49,240
Hanes manuals over here yeah yeah so my

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,370
current cars so Hanes car manuals were

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,080
really big deal in the UK where in the

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,130
era when cars when you open the bonnet

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,510
and have something other than a big

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,290
sheet of metal of the sticker on saying

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,290
warranty void if

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,240
Hanes have had to survive that

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,380
transition the way they've survived it

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,490
it's by producing you know the Haynes

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,350
manual for the space shuttle and

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,520
McCain's manual for a baby and they've

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,320
got a painful manual for them for the

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,280
resin for the Raspberry Pi so so we are

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,630
actually now starting to see an

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,220
ecosystem of books appearing around the

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,590
pine that's that's just been really

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,970
really gratifying we have at least one

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,100
O'Reilly book which is you know you've

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,510
made it this one was cool there's a

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:25,250
pre-medical Python this guy has figured

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,780
out how to get Python running as in the

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,980
desk in his desktop background so you

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,630
can give the focus to the desktop

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,220
background and start typing Python I

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,100
just think this is pretty much as close

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,260
as anyone has got to that primal boots

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,000
to programming language experience that

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,350
that I talked about earlier and I do

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,220
think that this is this is incredibly

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:45,770
cute cases we thought we were gonna make

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,670
a thousand of these maybe then 10,000 we

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,840
didn't think we were going to make

00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,850
enough of these for it to be worthless

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,890
designing any injection molds for cases

00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,620
so we didn't do a case what this has

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:58,610
meant is that we have left a lot of

00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,320
value out in the ecosystem there are a

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,880
lot of people making cases the Raspberry

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,130
Pi a lot of people getting nice little

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,560
businesses together around making cases

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,910
and accessories from the PI this is and

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,110
they cover that the cases you can get

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,300
for a Raspberry Pi cover the entire

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,650
gamut they cover the entire market this

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,690
is the bottom end of the market because

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,370
this is a PDF and you did you print this

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,750
one out onto the thickest paper you can

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,390
get through your through your printer

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,950
without jamming it

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,600
and then fold up and you've got a case

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,770
and it doesn't even catch fire which is

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,140
kind of cool so I like that I like the

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:36,309
pump this one's cool

00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:37,630
Legos we had this idea we wanted to

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,040
build a credit card sized computer and

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,750
the idea of the credit card size is

00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,790
largely a it's a way of driving our

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,170
focus on being small and B it's easy to

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,730
communicate you say it's a credit card

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,990
sized computer because it's not a credit

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,130
card sized computer because I didn't pay

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,020
enough attention to diversity in the

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,210
board layout my good friend Pete Lomas

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,870
also a trustee and so it's about a meal

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:59,049
off in each direction but by some

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,340
amazing magical fluke both the X and y

00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,870
dimensions of the board turn out to be

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:09,190
multiple of the logo basis unit size

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:10,900
very very closely yeah and so there's an

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,850
enormous world of Lego cases this case

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:17,080
was designed by a Girl Scout called biz

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:18,520
in the UK she's 11 years old and she

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,080
posted a tutorial on our website and

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,760
there's now a website in the UK where

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,429
you can buy Lego kits non-standard Lego

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,110
kits you can buy this because she

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:27,580
designed it she gets royalties on it and

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,660
because she's an 11 year old girl she

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,200
takes those royalties in the form of

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,799
Lego

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,799
so she

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,200
so shoes now I think got more like Oh

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,220
than me just about and then at the other

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,409
end by beau you showed that in a pie bow

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,090
yeah okay so so yeah Jessie's daughter

00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:51,820
had a absolutely beautiful case for her

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,929
Osprey pie this is a pie bow it is it's

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,279
designed by the guy who designed our

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:59,110
logo for us it is a spat it's a stack of

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,250
bits of perspex and it really is as you

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,650
probably saw from Jessica's photograph

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,580
the the most beautiful the most

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,419
beautiful place for a computer labelling

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,950
we've started to get some evidence that

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,840
kids alone to program on Raspberry Pi so

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,880
this kid is called Mikey here you can't

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,470
see because it's off its off camera but

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,820
he is learn to program in scratch at MIT

00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,990
scratch which we run we're spending a

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,909
lot of the money at the moment on

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:24,690
bringing performance on scratch up to up

00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:27,010
to par and on the PI so we had a really

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,120
parochial well view we were thinking

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,980
about trying to solve upon for Cambridge

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,309
University turns out protic it's all

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,750
over the UK want to program in what to

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,830
learn to program it turns out kids all

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,270
over the world want to learn to program

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,130
these kids are in utter Pradesh in India

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,360
and you can actually see in the bottom

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,840
left-hand corner that they really are

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,659
using scratch to learn to program we get

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,090
said a lot of these pictures spoiled out

00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:50,640
of my we we get sent a lot of these

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,720
pictures and there been some hard days

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,950
during the development of the Raspberry

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,559
Pi there's been some very very tough

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,929
moments and it's these sorts of pictures

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,549
that cheer us up and keep us going

00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,840
because it gives us some sort of

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:03,039
indication we might actually be

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,570
accomplishing something with this little

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,399
this little computer and we run

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,799
Minecraft I think I don't think I have

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,480
more to say about that I said they

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,630
needed to be a hub there needs to be a

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
hook to get these computers into kids

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,880
lives

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,770
apparently a lot of children enjoy

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,510
playing minecraft Mojang have been

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,799
incredibly helpful I've done a port of

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,419
their pocket edition of Minecraft Pocket

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,740
Edition to the ply called minecraft pi

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,809
edition the wonderful thing about

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,520
minecraft PI Edition is that the

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,250
Minecraft process has a socket on the

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,710
side of it you can bind to from any

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,909
pretty much any programming language see

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,159
if you can guess which most people use

00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:37,270
and you can actually text commands into

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,289
it to interact with the world and the

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,080
wonderful thing about this is it gives

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:42,500
kids a reason to program right it gives

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,120
you a reason to program you

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,740
be you wanna build a house you could be

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,720
like brick brick brick brick brick like

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,710
this or you can open the Python window

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,170
which I think you maybe else in

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,330
background go for 4x and range tan for

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,520
wide range 10 brick and then you build

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,380
build a floor and it's just it's got

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,300
that feeling of just very very quick

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,040
yeah very quick feedback you know this

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,510
they gives gives the child something

00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,450
that's immediately useful to them it

00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:07,100
gives it to them quickly I'll try to

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:11,270
take over the world what do you do

00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:13,220
tonight brain so this is this wonderful

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,690
map of this was done by a guy called Ron

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,730
Wallace Lee who was I think 14 at the

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,990
time it's a Google map hack self

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,310
registration map back and gives you some

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,510
idea of where or where the pies are all

00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,610
going or where the pies were going when

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,920
I well I took the screenshot you can see

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,380
Lots in a little bit outside our

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,120
Cambridge comfort zone here so quite a

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,620
few in the UK quite a lot in North

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,570
American North America is now our

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,070
largest both are it's been our largest

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,290
run rate market for the last three

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,600
months it is as of last month also has

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,620
our largest installed base which is you

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,910
know which is fantastic a lot more

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,790
really what we would hope for given how

00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,860
many of you there are so there are there

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,590
are little pockets of strength in South

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,670
Africa and Australasia I think we would

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,110
like to sell a hell of a lot more of

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,360
these in South America and a lot more of

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,150
these in India but we're getting around

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,670
we've got plans for those starting with

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,750
Wales which is where I come from when we

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,840
first started to build the Raspberry Pi

00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:06,140
we we did what everyone did which was to

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,790
go to go to China to build it and we

00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,860
built it in China and then a couple of

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,480
months into our run we got a call from

00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,740
Sony who have a factory in South Wales

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,470
and they said you know we think we can

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,950
build the pie at the price you need and

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,260
as of September last year we've been

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,700
building pies in the UK at the same

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,540
price that we could build them in

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,540
Shenzhen

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,250
for me it's a big deal because I come

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,380
from about ten miles away from that

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,710
factory that's where I was born the

00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,970
South Wales has like many areas that

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,680
used to be the industrial heartland of

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,830
the developed world has enormous

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,180
economic problems and the ability you

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,190
know that we can build the world's

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,930
cheapest general-purpose computer at the

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,820
appropriate cost in Wales it's a really

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,690
fantastic sign for all of us who worry

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,430
about whether we can have a

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:03,870
manufacturing industry in the developed

00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:09,810
world that was a personal one I really

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:11,670
enjoyed four four four things about

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:14,070
Python four reasons why Python is

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,780
important to us and then I said our name

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,280
we get our name for Python and I will be

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,860
spend the rest of my life defending my

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,620
ability to spell the name of Python but

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,380
yeah we owe you our name we owe you our

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,820
chip so 2835 which is the Broadcom chip

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,460
that I was on the design team for the

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,470
GPU in 2835 we designed the whole damn

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,490
thing using Python when we were

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,720
designing our sure we designed our

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,800
shader I would love to give a talk about

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,990
this at some point maybe in a future

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,760
year but we designed the trailor process

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,590
we designed and verified the vast

00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,960
majority the multimedia IP in our chip

00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,850
in Python because it is a hundred times

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,230
quicker to do that and then to port the

00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,280
result across to verilock than it is to

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,830
do the stuff in parallel because the

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,260
tools are just better we always have

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,690
this idea why our software tools some of

00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,460
better than Hardware CAD tools it's

00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,320
because programmers have to eat their

00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,940
own dog food right you know that's where

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,900
yeah basic engineer's have to read a

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,780
biography a software Python and a number

00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,610
of other interpretive languages have

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,200
given us the ability to bring into this

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:14,190
fairly unusual space in Psalm Linux

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,870
space a vast body of existing of very

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:19,320
robust existing software and have it run

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:21,180
as well in our world as it does in as it

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,450
does in the traditional x86 world and

00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,040
finally our teaching language we support

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,780
a lot of teaching languages for young

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,060
kids we support languages like logo and

00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,740
scratch we will always support C and C++

00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,600
for people want to get close to the

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,430
metal the wonderful things for us about

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,140
Python is a teaching language is it

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,140
gives us a story we can step we can tell

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,390
children we

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,840
can say learn this language in which

00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:46,390
hello world is print hello world and you

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,340
will be on a smooth curve that leads to

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,830
the language that all of these companies

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,140
use to program there will not be a

00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,400
discontinuity at any point between the

00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,890
moment where you sit down and write that

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,690
to line program to speed people in a

00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,890
computer store and the point where

00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,880
you're a professional software engineer

00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,020
we think that's extremely important

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:11,440
because every time there's a step in the

00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:14,380
curve people fall off the curve am I'm

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,760
very nearly done three things like just

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,170
three very quick things I'm thinking

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,960
about the moment but brackets and whole

00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:23,950
world that's shorthand for do we make

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,990
Python run Python 2.7 or Python 3 yes

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,060
it's good I have to make a choice at

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,230
some point fairly soon I think people

00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,790
are getting kind of confused because we

00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,440
have things like Pi gamers I think IV

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:36,940
installs one of them and it's all

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,800
horrible but we will gather pi PI we're

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,300
big fans of pi PI I think there so it's

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,680
a wonderful idea I've is a big user of

00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,240
psycho back in the day I forget I think

00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,830
you know these these tools are really

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,000
important one of the things we don't

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,590
have a lot of processing power on

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,070
Raspberry Pi and therefore we do spend a

00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,630
lot of effort on trying to just try to

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,520
try to squeeze as much as we can out of

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,720
the platform we have and pi PI suddenly

00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,100
looking in the performance pi PI looks

00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,650
like it's gonna be a big part of our

00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,700
future

00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,740
finally buddha pi said yeah i showed you

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,620
the desktop thing this thing floats

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,660
around this idea of having some mode

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,740
you're trying to get back to that world

00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,830
in which you have to choose not to

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,450
program we did have in 2008 at the point

00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,620
where we chose our foundations name we

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,300
did have a device that builded the

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,250
python and it continues to bump around

00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,899
in our heads how are we going to do this

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,040
we haven't really with major chief

00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:23,679
there's nothing education about the PI

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,350
it's just a cheap Linux box we still

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,390
wonder what the appropriate teaching

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,830
environment for the PI is

00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,970
and we wonder whether it's any of our

00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,060
business we wonder whether we should

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:36,909
just let the community come up with that

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,909
for us so there we are

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,899
I think that's all I had thank you very

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,140
much for your time thank you for having

00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:43,140
me here

00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:02,650
I do I have do I have time to take a

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:04,539
couple of questions or okay in that case

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,499
I will be loitering around here if

00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,390
anyone would like to come out of a chat

00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:08,829
afterwards please come visit our website

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,730
Rob Reider org tell us what you did with

00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:11,730
