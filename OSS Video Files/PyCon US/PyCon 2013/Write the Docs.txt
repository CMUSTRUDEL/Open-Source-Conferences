The greatest piece of software in the world is useless without great
documentation, but unfortunately most of us just don't write great
docs. This can be fixed, though. Documentation doesn't need to be an
afterthought, and doesn't ha

how everyone let's all welcome James

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:22,560
minutes who's going to tell us how to

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:24,510
write the docks hi much better so I'm

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,070
James for those of you who are in the

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,070
back and can't see me I look like this

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,140
you may know me as the release manager

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,719
for a Python web framework called Jango

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,239
which sometimes it's been claimed has

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,930
good documentation I'm not going to talk

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,270
about that my day job I work at Mozilla

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,649
one of the team behind the software

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,329
platform that powers the Mozilla

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,370
developer network which is your

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,770
all-in-one everything you could ever

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,850
want to know about web technology we

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,399
have articles tutorials demos you name

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,309
it it's a gigantic repository of

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,439
documentation on web tech I'm not going

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,560
to talk about that either what I'm going

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,770
to talk about is this ladies and

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,939
gentlemen this is a sloth specifically

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,770
it is a brown throated three-toed sloth

00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,600
now sloths are really fascinating

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,490
animals really amazing once you start

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,890
reading about them and I'm going to

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,590
present you with several sloth facts and

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,450
if this isn't already a service that I

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,979
can sign up for by text message I hope

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,130
that there is one by the end of the

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,240
conference so here's some facts about

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,340
sloths they can extract energy from very

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,310
low nutrition food source the sloths eat

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,170
leaves leaves have almost no energy in

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,090
them but they can manage to live off of

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,729
this this is an amazing evolutionary

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,189
feet they can do this because they have

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,759
multi-part stomachs it can take them up

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,090
to a month to digest their food that's

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,340
pretty long time sloths are also native

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,909
to only two parts of the world Central

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,799
and South America now you might be

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,110
wondering to yourself why is he talking

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,649
about sloths what do these have to do

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,780
with documentation well these are some

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,470
software User's photographed in their

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,900
natural hat

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,780
that earlier they come from all over the

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,570
world software users have to be clever

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,460
the way sloths are clever sloths have to

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,190
extract nutrition from food that

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,440
contains almost no energy users of

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,600
software have to extract utility from

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,790
code that is almost worthless and

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,100
typically has very bad documentation

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,420
this is what you all have in common with

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,000
sloths and the fact that you've been

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,800
able to get around this shows that you

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,170
are just as much of an evolutionary

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,760
achievement as the sloth so you should

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:51,690
feel honored to be compared to a sloth

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:54,000
now most software is like that it's bad

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,800
it has bad documentation it's hard to

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,520
learn it's hard to figure out how to use

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,950
it some software is good some software

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,560
has good documentation some software is

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,870
easy to learn easy to use easy to work

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,450
with that's the kind of software that

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,660
makes you look like this this is a very

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,880
happy sloth his name is Herman released

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,950
that's what the Wikipedia page says this

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,290
is what you want users of your software

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,720
to look like this is what you want to

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,519
give them through your documentation

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,410
because when you have happy users do you

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,269
know what happy users do happy users

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,950
stay with you through version after

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,959
version of your software and when you

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,870
release entirely new things they will be

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,330
more likely to try it out happy users

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,100
promote your software through word of

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,120
mouth they will go around to all of

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,680
their friends and all of their

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,799
colleagues and say wow I found this

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,530
great thing it was so easy and happy

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,530
users if you're open source eventually

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,870
contribute to your software that's the

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,480
killer feature these are things that you

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,040
want your users to be doing these are

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,160
things your users do when they're happy

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,130
how do you make your users happy well I

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,470
did a very scientific study and it turns

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,180
out that user happiness correlates with

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,370
the quality of your documentation I

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,810
absolutely have data to back this up I

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,510
swear this is like double-blind

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,600
everything

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,699
so how are we going to produce this

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,070
great documentation because obviously

00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:28,030
you need it obviously your software

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:31,060
needed obviously your users need it you

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,510
need to make this happen but how it's

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,639
hard now there are a lot of tools

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,490
especially in Python we can write

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,680
docstrings in our code we have sphinx we

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,370
have pie doc we have epi doc we have

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,350
tons and tons and tons of tools I'm not

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,330
going to talk about those you can go

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,979
find out the documentation tools they're

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,050
out there they've got good documentation

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,840
mostly what we're going to talk about is

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,120
how to make this happen from a writing

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,940
perspective for me what you need to do

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,380
perspective there is one thing and if

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,840
you take nothing else away from this

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,120
talk one thing that goes into writing

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,770
great documentation this is something

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,270
that I haven't always done I've been

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,630
guilty of breaking this rule myself

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,639
multiple times the one thing to keep in

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,120
mind when you're writing documentation

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,639
you are not up on high throwing

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,210
knowledge down to those unwashed masses

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,430
below you you are just a little bit

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,720
further ahead of them you are reaching

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,460
down a helping hand to pull them up

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,639
keeping that in mind letting that be

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,340
your attitude as you write keeps your

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,750
tone friendly keeps your tone

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,729
conversational keeps your tone feeling

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,160
approachable your goal in writing

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,680
documentation is not to make somebody an

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,500
expert who can recite your API from

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,090
memory your goal is to make someone who

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,349
doesn't know how to do something into

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,780
someone who does know how to do

00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:01,120
something your goal is to empower them

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,160
through your documentation so if you

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,190
remember nothing else about writing

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:11,650
documentation remember this be like this

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:13,000
sloth this is a pretty cool sloth now do

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,729
you remember the second thing i told you

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,720
about sloths who remembers it what was

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,419
it sloths have multiple stomachs just

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,940
like ruminants this is very important

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,870
because it turns out software users are

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,230
like this they also

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,490
have multiple stomachs turns out

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,500
everybody learns a little bit

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,390
differently some people like different

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,310
learning styles some people need

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,220
multiple learning styles just for one

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,620
person not everybody learns the same way

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,990
not everybody gets the same value out of

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,090
the same piece of documentation this

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,710
means you need to have multiple things

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:54,250
now here's a list you don't need to do

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,650
all of these for every project you do

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,210
but here are some things you can do

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,190
here's all sorts of different ways you

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,490
can write and produce documentation you

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,500
can do tutorials you can do examples you

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,750
can do an API reference you can do

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,000
downloadable samples you can do in-depth

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,730
guide you can do all of these things you

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,100
don't have to do them all but the more

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,780
of them you do the more different kinds

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,340
of people the more different styles of

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,110
learning you're going to cater to and

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,650
the more people you're going to be able

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,240
to reach this should be your goal when

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,730
you're writing documentation for your

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,310
users who have multi-part stomachs you

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:37,280
want to feed all of their stomachs not

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:39,740
just one when you're writing keep your

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,330
audience in mind because there's a big

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,410
difference between some of these if

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,390
you're writing your introductory

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,910
tutorial versus you're writing your API

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,230
reference obviously very different

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,270
groups of people are going to be looking

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,700
at these things different stomachs are

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,020
going to be digesting them so for

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,320
example if you're dealing with a new

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,150
user the new user is like a baby sloth

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,880
baby sloths need lots and lots of care

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,210
and feeding so do new users be very

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,970
careful in your style assume nothing

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,950
don't assume they know anything don't

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,350
bury them in lots and lots of details

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,000
right away give them the high level give

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,650
them the explanation of here's what

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,870
we're going to do here's the next thing

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,330
we're going to do don't go into well

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,400
we're going to build a whiskey app using

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,890
a multi-threaded worker pool background

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,350
don't do that tell them we're going to

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,200
build a website we're going to set up

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,870
the web sir you don't need to smother

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,640
them with the jargon right away and you

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,279
do need to give them lots of

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,839
documentation and lots of eggs

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,519
impuls just the same way you need to

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,219
give this baby sloth his bottle every

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,539
couple hours otherwise he'll starve and

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,459
your users will run away from you

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,999
because nobody likes someone who kills a

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:51,490
baby sloth experienced users are a

00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:54,519
little different experienced users you

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,110
can assume some things maybe they

00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,819
haven't used your software before but

00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,949
they've used other other software maybe

00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:01,480
they know some of the terminology you

00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:03,959
can start writing your more in depth

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,329
guides for your expert advanced users

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,509
you can use a little more of that you

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,319
can give lots and lots of links and

00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,199
cross-references and let them go back

00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:15,790
and forth and find things on their own

00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,899
you can give them practical examples

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,519
that they're going to just be able to

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,110
copy and paste or they're going to come

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,720
by your site from a google search saying

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,959
how do I do this and oh look here's an

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,910
example of how to do this so keep that

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,290
in mind as you're writing because

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,850
different parts of your documentation

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,350
are going to appeal two very different

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,009
types of users and you need to know

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:40,209
who's going to be reading each one who

00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:44,319
remembers the third sloth fact sloths

00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:46,480
come from where Central and South

00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:49,230
America now what does that have to do

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,839
with documentation that's a tricky one

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,370
so I'm going to back up a bit I'm going

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,600
to go through my first few slides again

00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:00,879
I'm going to see if you notice a

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:05,920
difference okay mojo de sua James c'est

00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:11,620
moi COI co Django a como se de año y see

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:16,769
my CC and per se that I see a girl

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,769
Sabrina anybody notice the difference

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,649
how would you feel if you'd walked into

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,390
this talk and that was really how I

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,480
started it would you be a little

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,070
confused maybe wonder where you are

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,269
maybe next year in Montreal that would

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,160
work but not here in California so it

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,890
turns out people from around the world

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,870
may use your software they may not speak

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,190
english very well it may not be their

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,209
native language they may not speak much

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,130
English at all unfortunately English is

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,279
the worst language except for all the

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,420
others 150 years ago French was the

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,510
international language that everybody

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,459
used before that Latin and Greek today

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,470
English is kind of the International

00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:58,600
technological language so write your

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,550
documentation in English but keep in

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,490
mind that not everybody who reads it is

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,790
a native speaker so you know don't go

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,410
overboard with your English vocabulary

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,360
those of you who like me have Liberal

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,579
Arts degrees I unfortunately love

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,910
semicolons too much I need to stop using

00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:18,610
them I have a problem I can admit it so

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,829
just that in mind as you're writing the

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,390
person who reads it you know go read

00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,920
some articles on the simple english

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,320
wikipedia and look at how they write

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,839
that stuff they can express very

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,550
complicated ideas in very simple English

00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,829
that almost anyone from anywhere in the

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,010
world can read if they have just a

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:38,380
little bit of knowledge of the language

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,480
now how do we make this happen how do we

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,950
get this into our process this is what

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,390
developers look like sometimes when you

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,630
tell them to write documentation they

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:48,700
get angry they puff up there like I

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,220
can't do this there are a couple tricks

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,320
the one that works for me the one I have

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,060
found work over and over and over again

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,410
is what I call documentation driven

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,839
development who's familiar with

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,329
test-driven development it's where you

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,970
write the test first then you write the

00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:05,860
code documentation driven development is

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,350
very much the same way you write your

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,810
documentation first then you write the

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,279
code that you just documented the nice

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,560
thing about this is you know how it's

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,240
supposed to work would you ever really

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,519
sit down and write some code without

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,350
knowing what it was going to do at your

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,240
day job would you sit down and implement

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,130
a feature without at least discussing

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,990
what it's going to do and having a

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,840
ticket or something describing it you're

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,080
already writing some documentation

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,150
may only be in your head write it down

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,800
turn that into a speck turn that into

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,420
what you're going to refer to as you

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,430
write so you know what it's supposed to

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,190
do and somebody else can come along

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,780
later and read it and find out this

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,390
really meshes well with something in the

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,640
Zen of Python says if the implementation

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,100
is hard to explain it's a bad idea I

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,470
can't tell you how many times I've run

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,230
into this trying to write documentation

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,480
for something and saying wow that's a

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,010
really bad way of doing this and it's

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,690
much easier to throw out a documentation

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,670
than it is to throw out code at this

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,890
stage so it's much better to be doing it

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,080
this way and the converse if the

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,210
implementation is easy to explain it may

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,130
be a good idea so if you find your

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,430
documentation really flowing you might

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,110
be on the right way to do things final

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,160
thing and this is some projects that

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,560
I've been involved with have had this

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,780
policy Django has this policy if your

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,300
patch doesn't have documentation your

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,920
patch doesn't merge make that part of

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,280
your workflow and your documentation

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,110
will improve immeasurably we did it on

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:36,120
the Django that's one way we've

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:38,130
maintained quality for years so just

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,170
don't go overboard I will give my

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,260
personal example i wrote a module it's

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,170
849 lines long and only 250 of them are

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,780
code the rest of it is docstrings that's

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,660
a little too much you don't want to

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,400
drown the baby sloth in milk you just

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,000
want to feed it appropriately and at the

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,950
right times keep all this in mind keep

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,040
this in your process right lots of

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,620
documentation right good documentation

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,020
make your users happy that's all we ask

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,020
you to do anybody have questions

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,250
by the way if you want to know where i

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,820
found all the sloths there they are but

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,820
I like Herman

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,220
is there a microphone okay i guess the

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,220
microphones way over there

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,640
so there's a lot of existing projects in

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:50,180
the world that I would like to use how

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,670
do i convince them to do docks how do I

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,820
get them to just do the no Doc's no

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,980
merge as a starting point it is a lot

00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,660
harder to retrofit these attitudes and

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,580
what Jeremy's asking is how do i get an

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,190
existing project to adopt these kinds of

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,760
things it is a lot harder when a project

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,300
already exists and is set in its waste

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,480
usually the way I would approach it is

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,590
talk to them about the benefits you know

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,900
talk to them about how they're going to

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,420
grow their user base and you really can

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,670
point to the easier you make it the more

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,290
people are going to use this cell that

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,790
is a benefit that you're going to have

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,130
more users or you're going to have more

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,840
customers the easier this gets the more

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,730
people are going to want to use your

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,110
software that's the way to sell it

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,640
because that's what we all want really

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,240
we want something that's easy to use

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,680
easy to learn easy to work with so sell

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,970
that as the main point that's the

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,420
benefit yeah Django's documentation is

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,310
so nice to me because it has this very

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,220
narrative style to it at least at first

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,640
eventually it gets into more of an API

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,310
documentation style but the narrative

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,830
seems so nice and when we sit down at

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,260
our company to write docs I tend to I

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,320
get stuck I find that difficult did that

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,510
come easier to you over time writing

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,110
that sort of narrative style

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,450
documentation as opposed to very API

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,410
those if it goes writing narrative style

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:20,150
documentation get easier with time I

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,570
don't know that I could say personally

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:26,060
my background is in philosophy okay I'm

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,019
used to writing sentences that span

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,819
three pages

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,959
and I kind of have to tone that down

00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:36,300
when I'm writing technical documentation

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,309
but what I find a lot of the time is

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,009
when I'm writing and it doesn't have to

00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:42,809
be big just like small examples every

00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,699
little example is a story you're telling

00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,889
a user a story of how they can do

00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:49,139
something so even if it's just a couple

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,829
paragraphs that narrative style can work

00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,209
really well and having in your mind

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,429
step-by-step the story that you're

00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,119
telling will often just make that flow

00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,119
automatically

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:18,040
anybody else anyone else last call going

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:22,180
once going twice hey oh we are one last

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,089
minute what kind of software do you have

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:28,150
that helps with documentation so that

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:33,000
you know that what you're writing is

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:36,520
actually displayed in the documentation

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,500
as far as getting things to display and

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,570
knowing that everything works in the

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,640
software tools like usually I just use

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,020
Sphinx that seems to be what everybody

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,760
on the Python world is using these days

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,560
but again like tools come and go a few

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,300
years ago Sphinx didn't exist we wrote

00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,430
everything by hand and restructured text

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,970
a few years before that we did other

00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:00,580
things honestly the tools been getting

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,850
better that I tend not to focus too much
