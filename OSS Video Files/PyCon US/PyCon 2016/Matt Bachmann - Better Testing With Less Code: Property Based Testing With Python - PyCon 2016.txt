Title: Matt Bachmann - Better Testing With Less Code: Property Based Testing With Python - PyCon 2016
Publication date: 2016-05-31
Playlist: PyCon 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Matt Bachmann

Standard unit tests have developers test specific inputs and outputs. This works, but often what breaks code are the cases we did not think about. Property based testing has developers define properties of output and has the computer explore the possible inputs to verify these properties. This talk will introduce property based testing and provide real world examples and patterns.
