Hello everyone. This is Web Design for Non-Designers.

00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,620
Extend a warm welcome to our speaker, Tracy Osborn.

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:13,380
[applause]

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,420
(Tracy Osborn) Hello.

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,960
All right, there we go.

00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,520
So, hi. I'm Tracy.

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,240
First slide, this happens every conference I'm at.

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm actually @limedaring on Tracy; just getting ahead of it this time.

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,999
People think I'm lime darling, and I think that's hilarious.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
And I have that Twitter account, but I am lime daring.

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,260
And later on I'll be tweeting out link to the slides,

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,680
and some links that I mention in this talk.

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
So a little bit about me.

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,260
About seven years ago, long story short,

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,820
seven years ago I taught myself how to code.

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,900
I launched an initial version of this website called WeddingLovely,

00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,660
and seven years later it turned into a startup.

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,420
I went through 500 Startups.

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,240
And spoke about it a couple PyCons ago if anyone was here for that,

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,120
which was pretty awesome.

00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,720
And now I'm the developer relations --

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,980
I work in developer relations at DreamFactory which is really awesome.

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,100
This happened literally like a month and a half ago,

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,020
so this is very new to me.

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,100
But this talk is really --

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,820
this whole part about design, I was a designer.

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,620
I went to school at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for graphic design.

00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,840
And like I said, I taught myself how to code.

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,340
And I wrote these couple books called Hello Web App,

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,380
which is like, super awesome.

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,800
It came out -- really cool -- so by the way, if you want to teach

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,820
or learn about Django web app development, these are my books.

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,580
So I wrote about how to do design --

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,680
excuse me, how to do development for non-developers,

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,530
but then it occurred to me that there isn't really a good resource out there

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,460
designed for non-designers, and that's really where this talk comes from.

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,200
It's going to be my third book and it's not written yet,

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,780
but I'm using this talk as a way to kind of figure out

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,160
what's going to go in this future book.

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,660
When I talk about design -- the world of design is so gigantic.

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,700
There's user experience design and visual design,

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,280
and interaction design, and people who do UI;

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,500
they have all of these specialties. It's kind of super overwhelming.

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,380
When I say design, I really just wanted --

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,520
Design is really just making an interface,

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,640
whatever you're trying to design.

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,800
By design I mean just making an interface that works well.

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,520
Because, even if you're not a designer and you don't think

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,400
you're going to become "a designer," you still will probably in your lifetime

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,360
have to design something like a home page for your project that you built.

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,880
You know, something like this or this, or Node.js.

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,060
You know, all of these are fairly simple and they can be done by people

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,620
who are not specifically designers.

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,600
And, this is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to design.

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm not going to talk about things like the golden ratio.

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,310
It drives me absolutely batty whenever it's an introduction to design,

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,180
and they go over, like, "Here's a golden ratio", and I'm like, "Arghhh."

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,640
That does not need to be in a beginner talk.

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,920
And I won't go over parts of typography,

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,260
which is also my pet peeve. That shouldn't go in a beginner talk.

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,700
It's super fascinating to figure out all the pieces and parts of a letter,

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,280
but that's not beginning design.

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,980
Really this is just for anyone who will be building a website

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,100
or building a home page for an app

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,740
or building a form or building a little widget.

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,100
How can you make that, whatever you're designing,

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,820
look a little better and perform a little better?

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,600
So, first, let's talk about clutter.

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,460
My favorite example for the ultimate cluttery website

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,900
is of course GoDaddy of yore.

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,720
[laughs]

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,860
This is the faster way to better looking designs.

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,440
I'm kind of going into the visual part first,

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,820
not user experience.

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,420
So just speaking about visuals,

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,120
fastest way to a better design is to cut down on clutter.

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,700
So to illustrate this, I made this little widget.

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,060
Now, not saying y'all are gonna be building something like this,

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,700
but it's a good example as we go through some design principles,

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,620
apply it to this widget, and see how it improves.

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,380
So the first principle we're going to talk about is the grid.

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,840
We probably all have heard about the grid.

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,640
Adding a grid to design is essentially just lining things up.

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,860
Pixel differences are definitely noticed,

00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,040
like when something is two pixels off.

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,980
There's always that story about the designer

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,800
and developer that work together.

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,900
Designer gives the developer the perfect mockup,

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,980
and the developer implements it, and the designer's like,

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,400
"Ah, everything is up and down and a little bit off."

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,330
And the developer's like, "It doesn't matter,

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,160
"it's only two pixels." But those little pixels --

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
if it's just something that's just two pixels off from a grid,

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
it's one of those kind of things that's unconsciously noticed,

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,940
and it adds to the sense of clutter in the design.

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,440
So you can implement a grid to whatever you're designing by scratch,

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,800
but I recommend to take advantage of systems like Bootstrap

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,120
which have a grid system already built in.

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,860
There's no sense in doing something completely from scratch

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,940
when you can use something that helps you out and gives you --

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,420
that essentially bootstraps your design.

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,980
So, back to this little widget,

00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,020
if we just line things up,

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,540
if we just take the columns of contents and header and the form and the button,

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,840
and just give them even margins around the edges,

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
you can see that it's already a little bit cleaner.

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,800
So the next principle is color.

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,150
So to go into the overarching color principles

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,540
which you read in all these beginner design books,

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,319
they usually say, "You got to keep your colors complementary."

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,060
They don't really explain about what that means.

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,520
Use mostly neutral colors; use one bright color to make things pop.

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,960
There's a lot of good resources out there like this article on Smashing Magazine

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
which I'll tweet later, which really goes into color.

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,280
In school, I took a whole quarter on color theory.

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,500
And that's ridiculous, and I don't recommend anyone

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,720
to do something like that when --

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
if you don't want to become a full-fledged designer,

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,500
you can just take advantage of shortcuts like COLOURlovers.

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,400
I use COLOURlovers for anything I design.

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,880
There is no way I'm going to build a color palette from scratch.

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,440
Because in COLOURlovers you can go in -- people can submit palettes,

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,020
and then other people can vote on whether they love that palette.

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,080
And then you can go in and search by most-loved palettes of all time,

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,939
and get these color palettes which are pretty much guaranteed

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,930
to have complementary colors, and usually you can see ones

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,820
that have like a pop color.

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,419
It's just a great shortcut, and you can scroll through

00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,180
all the color palettes on COLOURlovers and find something that works for you.

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,240
Like, my website WeddingLovely is purples and pinks.

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,909
COLOURlovers; it was one of the palettes I found there.

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:42,280
My books are oranges and yellows, a pop of green -- also COLOURlovers.

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,260
So back to this little widget, which is kind of like black

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,560
and kind of contrasting greens.

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,560
I grabbed a color palette and applied it to the widget,

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,880
and it's a little overly colorful,

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,180
but it does work a little bit better than it was before.

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,020
And one thing I want to point out --

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
it's not really going to show up in the slides --

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,300
but you, you know, the color palettes from COLOURlovers are not set in stone.

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,200
The red of the button is a darker red

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,220
than the one in the color palette in the top.

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,920
So feel free to play with them, lighten things, darken things,

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,080
but it's a great shortcut to give yourself,

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,760
you know, a jumpstart into building design

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,080
and doing a nice-looking color palette without starting from scratch.

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,860
Next principle: fonts.

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,740
So again, with the principles, people usually say,

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,440
keep the number of fonts low because lots of different fonts

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,640
in design can be a sign of clutter.

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,020
Use fancy/display fonts sparingly -- excuse me.

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,320
And that's -- a good example of all those fonts

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
are the ultimate example of clutter --

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,900
are these display fonts I used in the background here.

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,140
So clean fonts also reduce the feeling of clutter in designs.

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,580
And then if you want to add more differentiation in your designs,

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,160
when it comes to typography, you can then explore with italics,

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,040
and bolding, and transforms -- like making something uppercase --

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,100
to differentiate stuff.

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,300
But as a shortcut, this is also what I use.

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,970
Because you can go to Google Fonts and try to pick out your fonts

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,520
and get completely overwhelmed by the hundreds of fonts

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,240
scrolling through, and it's really, I don't know, completely overwhelming.

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
So there's resources out there like Beautiful Web Type

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,660
where people choose -- well, they pick out

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,000
the really beautiful Google Fonts that are out there,

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Google web fonts that are free to use, and they display them in this website

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,860
so you can see how they look on a real website.

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,920
There's other sites like Typewolf, which again, you know,

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,500
curated collection of the 30 best Google Fonts.

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,900
So this is a great way to -- if you're choosing a font for your design

00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,460
and you get overwhelmed by how many different types of fonts are out there,

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,860
just go find these resources where people chose their favorites,

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,300
and you can see it kind of narrows choice, makes it easier to choose,

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,080
and it's easier to find something that you think looks professional.

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
So, back to the widget.

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
And then we added -- this is two different fonts.

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,240
It's a serif font and sans serif font.

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Essentially means, serif font has little flanges on all the letters.

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,400
But just two different fonts, and there's differentiation in here.

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,120
Like there's italics on the headline, the form,

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,060
the button has uppercase, it's a little spaced out.

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,740
But it's only two different fonts and they work really well together.

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,800
So the little widget here is looking a little cleaner.

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,980
Last but not least: white space.

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,900
White space is the ultimate clutter reducer.

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,680
I always laugh at, like, Hacker News, because --

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,880
I mean, I read it all the time, but it's a pretty cluttery design.

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,380
All this text all smashed up against each other.

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,700
And a lot of designers also feel the same way.

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,440
So fairly often there'll be a Hacker News post saying,

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,460
"I redesigned Hacker News."

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,340
And it's something like this, or like this,

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,020
and all of them are always more white space.

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,940
It's like designers look at Hacker News

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,200
and like, "Oh my god, it needs white space."

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,060
The white space can really help a design

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,600
even if you have a super cluttery design

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,560
that has to stay cluttered, like a newspaper homepage.

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,700
So the before is on the left and the after is on the right.

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,280
One further thing that New York Times did was that they reduced clutter

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,260
by reducing the number of colors on the site.

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,820
So, instead of the headlines being blue, they're black.

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,640
But one of the biggest things they did to make their homepage look less cluttery

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,280
was just to simply add more space in between the columns of text.

00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,880
And just like, adding just a tiny bit more space

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,940
allows the design to breathe more,

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,300
just look a little bit more open, a little less cluttery,

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,140
even though they still have a ton of text and a lot of items on their homepage.

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,220
And white space is definitely a huge trend right now.

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,660
I went on to one of these design collection sites

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,560
and I took a random screenshot,

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,720
and at every single one of these is acres of white space.

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,060
It's not saying you have to do something like this,

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,980
but it's kind of handy that it's the current web design trend

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,040
going on right now, too.

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,960
But it's not just a good thing to do

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,360
just for like, you know -- make it look nicer.

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,260
It can drastically affect your conversion rates as well.

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,080
So in this example, the two tables -- there's the links

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,900
underneath the orange buttons that you can see in the left one.

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,020
That was taken out, which added a little more white space

00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,620
in between these two tables.

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,500
And because the person did that and they did a test,

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,560
saw a 20% improvement in engagement, 5% boost in products added to the cart,

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,800
and a 33% improvement in customers continuing through their purchase.

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
So white space not only just looks nicer,

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,800
it does affect how much money your site can make

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,420
and your conversion rates overall.

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,180
Back to the little widget, and we just add some more white space.

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,600
The things I did here: I added some more space around the edges,

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
kind of beefed up the margins around the edge.

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,200
I also normalized the spacing in between the elements,

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,800
so between the headline and the content,

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,020
content and the form, form and the button.

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,750
I also added a little bit more white space

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,600
in the form of line height in between the lines of text

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,900
in the content so it doesn't smush all together.

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:02,240
And the headline also has a little bit more space added as well.

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,420
So when it comes to clutter, and it comes to visual design,

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,280
the things to remember is just to reduce visual clutter

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,780
by keeping the number of fonts and colors low,

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,640
adding white space, and lining things up.

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,300
Aiming for a clean design, which, again,

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,460
is one of those big trends going on right now,

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,600
is one of the fastest ways and easiest ways

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,720
to have a less cluttery and more professional looking design.

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,920
But we can't talk about design without, like --

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,340
We can talk about how the design looks, but really the most important thing

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,840
about design is how it works.

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,340
So whenever you're designing something, try to figure out

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,760
what the most important action is on your design,

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,980
and try to make that action or whatever the person

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,480
on your design needs to do, make it easy for them to do it.

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,880
This is why buttons CTAs, button call-to-actions

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
are usually a brighter color so they can stand out,

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
and so someone doesn't lose the button; catches the eye.

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,300
Someone knows that this is the primary action of this form.

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,940
So for the website that I built for Hello Web App,

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,840
I had a little bit of a design challenge

00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,280
on the homepage where I had two buttons.

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,040
But the main one that I want people to look at and see and hopefully click

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,780
is the "get the books" button, which is why it's bright green.

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,420
Now if you go to other websites, this website is a very subdued

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,160
color palette, it's very dark gray and blues,

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,640
but the action button is bright blue in the middle.

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,620
It doesn't just have to be a homepage and a button on a homepage.

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,070
The Wealthfront Engineering blog -- you can argue that the reason

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,350
why they have this blog is to attract engineers to join their company.

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,800
So as they write about engineering, hopefully someone comes to their website,

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,920
goes, "Hey, these people are pretty cool," and then the sidebar, it says,

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,100
"Hey, interested in what you have to see here? Apply for a job."

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,060
And that's the reason why that widget is bright green,

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,120
so it doesn't get lost and it's eye-catching.

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,740
So essentially, pay attention to your goals.

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,660
There's so much more I can say about user experience.

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,940
But the main thing is just to pay attention to your goals.

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,140
Make sure that whatever action you want your users to take,

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,760
make sure it's easy for them take it.

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,500
I don't really go into usability testing here,

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,220
but a great way to test the experience of your website

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,880
is just simply to sit down with someone and have them run through it.

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,190
It's kind of hard to do that because then the person can find

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,780
some things that are wrong, and then nitpick, criticize your design.

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,820
But if you can remember that it's for the good of the design,

00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,680
the good of what you're designing, making sure someone else

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,820
looks at your design, tests it out,

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,160
it's a great way to run a quick usability test,

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,780
and make sure your goals and what your actions

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,260
you want your users to do --

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,340
that those actions are easy to find and use.

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,900
So, to go back into clutter a little bit,

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,220
I want to talk a little bit about content.

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,569
So when it comes to running content for websites,

00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,360
a lot of people tend to write way too much.

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,480
Now, you've seen the "about" page on someone's website

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
where they're telling you their entire life story

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,740
and, like, paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs.

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,600
No one reads that; maybe someone will read it, maybe their mom.

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,300
But usually people on the Internet, they really skim.

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,700
And big paragraphs on a website or a landing page are a sign of clutter.

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,660
They're kind of intimidating.

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,060
So, when it comes to content, less really is more.

00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,840
Big paragraphs are a sign of clutter, and break into bullets if you can.

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
Try to shorten your sentences, make smaller paragraphs.

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
If you can't do that, one of the easiest ways

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,620
to break something out is to break into bullets like this.

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,020
So on the left, it's kind of a big paragraph, it's hard to read.

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,140
And just by adding some bullets,

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,260
makes it a little easier to jump between the important sections,

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,020
because those bullets give the eye a bit of a landing place.

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,460
But we can increase the readability of this by adding some bolding.

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,320
So when someone sees this paragraph of content, they can read --

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,980
very quickly see the bolded sections, and the bolded sections highlight

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,140
the most important part of that paragraph.

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,660
If someone is skimming --

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,240
makes it easy for them to see what's there

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,600
and if they see something they're interested in reading further,

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,920
then they can stop skimming and read the paragraph in full.

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,820
But, like I said, white space is the ultimate clutter reducer,

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,820
and this is a great place to add more white space if you can,

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,180
by adding a little bit of space in between those bullets.

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,520
Makes it super skimmable.

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
So, I love Read the Docs.

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,480
I just spoke at Write the Docs; Eric Holscher is a friend of mine.

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,980
And I was prepping for this talk,

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,540
and I was thinking about ultimate clickable CTAs,

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,100
and I was looking at this like, "Everything is gray."

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,940
So the button on the homepage

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,780
is, on hover, bright green.

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,040
So whenever you have a website, and this is what I would recommend to him

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,060
if he asked my opinion, which he hasn't yet.

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,980
I'm just talking about it on stage.

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,460
[laughter]

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,660
I would say, "Hey, this is something that would be really easy to test here,

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:49,080
"to see if more people search the docs if that button was a brighter color."

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,320
But we can test other things, because I just talked about content.

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,840
And that content is really quite lovely.

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,120
You know, "What is this place," that paragraph of content.

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,200
This is not as pretty, but if it was broken up,

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,180
I would argue that this is worth testing.

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,440
By breaking up that content, the paragraph of text, into bullets,

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,620
adding some bolding to, again, highlight the important parts of the sentences.

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,340
I also -- that headline saying "What is this place?"

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,660
I answer that question right at the top so that people --

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,680
you know, a little bit quicker to see the important information.

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,460
So again, not as pretty, but this is something when it was like usability --

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,900
you lack something, like little improvements

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,120
to this web page that I would recommend.

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,460
But we can't just talk about content without talking about headlines.

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,700
So when it comes to headlines, it's often really tempting

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,420
to write headlines and introductions to web pages

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,340
as whatever you're designing for, what is it doing,

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,840
but it is important to remember that it's --

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,880
you should be writing for your reader in mind.

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,740
I think, whatever you're designing,

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,320
what benefits you'll be giving to that reader.

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,080
And also of course, keep it short and use natural, friendly language

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,940
because you don't want to talk like a machine;

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,800
you want to talk like a human.

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,880
So for example, this is technically what my book is about.

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,600
It is an introduction to building web apps using Python and Django.

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,420
But this is what the homepage says: it's "Learn how to build a web app."

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,940
It's a lot easier for readers and for people coming to my website

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,120
to see how this website, how my books might benefit them.

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,060
Now you can argue that I could probably update this and test it,

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,200
but this is lightyears ahead of that.

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,380
And changes like this also can improve your bottom line.

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,520
This article goes over how a simple headline change

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:54,990
improves conversions by 52.8%, and all they did was took their headline

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,360
and talked more about the benefits to the reader rather than the details

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,420
of what something did.

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,020
So we're not done with the widget.

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,720
You notice that the headline here -- "Download my book on learning

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,560
"how to program Django" -- that's kind of like, "Ehh."

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,560
What if we updated that to say, "Hey, learn how to make web apps"?

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,980
The button at the bottom, as well as the form --

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,789
I also -- everything I updated, the content too.

00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:24,740
The content is shorter.

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,260
The field, instead of just "email address" --

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,300
a little more human by saying, "add your email here".

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,000
The button is a little more actionable; "download" is still an action verb,

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,740
but "send me free info" kind of gives a little bit more information

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,040
to the person looking at this widget. They're like, "Ooh, free."

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,360
So during this, we've gone from this widget,

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,660
to this, by applying small, little changes.

00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,120
Principles, applying it here.

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,240
You can kind of see how this can make a cleaner, more usable design.

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,480
Quick sidenote about images and imagery because we've been really only talking

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,200
about text and color and whatnot.

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,160
In terms of some image principles, some guidelines,

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,360
you can accomplish a lot with just type and screenshots,

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,920
which is why earlier versions of this talk,

00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,320
I actually didn't talk about images.

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Stock photos, there's a lot of stock photo websites out there,

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,700
and a lot of them look like stock photos where the person's like:

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,340
[poses]

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,080
Someone coming to your website -- and you want to have

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,409
a photo of someone on there, they can immediately see

00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:38,100
it's a stock photo, and it's kind of like, "Ehh."

00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,680
And then photos are also hard because you have to pay attention

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,780
to the file size.

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,780
On my website for my book, I had that gigantic image,

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,520
and that was something I had to optimize a lot

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,460
to make sure my website wasn't horrifically hard to download.

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,900
Little, little like design updates can really make a homepage sing.

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,899
These little icons here on the Stripes website

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,860
are really quite lovely.

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
So, designers are gonna yell at me.

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,840
If you're looking for custom icons for your site,

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,600
I am totally okay with anyone going to Fiverr

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,200
or crowdSPRING and just seeing if there's a designer out there,

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,220
for not a lot of money, can build something for you.

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,570
Because I totally understand building websites,

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,900
not having a lot of money to hire a professional designer,

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,580
and I think this is a great way to get imagery --

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,680
custom imagery for your site, without paying a lot of money.

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,100
There's a lot of free resources out there that are really great too.

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,420
So if you really want a giant banner --

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,760
this is actually unsplash.com; the name of it kind of got lost there.

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,880
But Unsplash has really lovely, big images

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,040
that are free to use and download.

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,940
There's also PhotoPin which allows you to search for Creative Commons imagery.

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,300
And little designs, even if you can work with a local designer or an illustrator.

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,370
This is my friend's website. He worked with an illustrator

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,440
to build these adorable illustrations on their homepage,

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,560
which kind of takes their homepage, makes it look a little more special

00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,680
than just, you know, screenshot and text.

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,180
So one thing I want to emphasize that if you're designing,

00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,700
you don't have to be original.

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,580
One of the things I tell people is that if you're sitting down

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,580
to do this design and you start with a blank piece of paper,

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,139
and you start from scratch, it's a lot like trying to program

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,540
without the use of Stack Overflow; it's near impossible.

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,560
I use inspiration -- I don't copy, but I'm heavily inspired

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,660
by so many different sources for anything I design.

00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,940
So, "A Book Apart" heavily inspired my books.

00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:06,280
And there's a lot of sites out there you can use to pull in inspiration.

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,960
Just find things -- find sites that inspire you

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,480
or things that you want to emulate, and use them in your own designs.

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,600
So this is siteInspire, and Unmatched Style, and CSSMania.

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,880
There are so many different websites out there to just showcase good design.

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,999
So when you find a design you like, you can kind of pick out the things

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,960
you think are working well and that's something

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,500
that's going to help you train your design eye.

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,960
So for Slack's homepage here --

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,100
I mean kind of just figure out, okay, why does this look so nice?

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,520
One of things they're doing is adding those little squiggles in their headline.

00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,760
That's something you don't really see, so that kind of stands out.

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,920
They have lots of white space.

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,240
Their form has a darker background which catches the eye

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,180
and they have that bright green "create a team" link.

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,260
They have their text, they have bolding,

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,040
strategic bolding for the important parts.

00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,920
There's lots of things you can go through

00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,800
and figure out what Slack is doing well,

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,220
and as you find things you think are working well,

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,020
try to figure out what is working well, and that'll help train your design eye.

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,920
Because, it is totally okay --

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,980
Picasso says, "Good artists copy, great artists steal."

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,460
Banksy comes along, says, "Bad artists imitate, great artists steal."

00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,020
There's full-on books about how you can steal like an artist.

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,340
Like, this is a thing: all of the artists,

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,280
we just, like, get inspired by others.

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,580
So don't try to design from scratch; find things that inspire you.

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,660
Last but not least, I want to give a quick overview of a design process

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,720
just to show how I work.

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,019
So if you're sitting down and get an assignment

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,600
or you want to build a homepage, first thing you have to do is go out,

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,160
find the inspiration, and sketch your ideas.

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,940
And this is my actual Feedly reader

00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,380
where I can just go through these top design websites,

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,380
scroll through until I find things I think will be relevant,

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,360
and I can save them and pick out everything I like.

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,660
I usually sketch them, and FYI, my sketches don't look like this.

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,710
This person is totally showing off.

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,020
Like, it bothers me to see sketches like this;

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm like, "That's not how it usually looks."

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,180
My sketches are just squiggles and boxes.

00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,880
It's just a way for me to remember important parts.

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,560
Things that I like or lay out ideas I like.

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,100
These are the sketches for that Hello Web App homepage.

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,619
And then next thing, in terms of mocking it up,

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,980
you can go straight to HTML if you're building something,

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,480
but mockup stage is a really great way to see something as it might look

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,760
and have the ability really quickly, the ability to move things around.

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,120
So this is one of my husband's projects.

00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,740
This is not a pixel-perfect mockup;

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,800
this was just an idea of what the content should look like.

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Decided that, instead of a paragraph, again, to use bullets.

00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,560
It allowed us to figure out, okay, we'll have a big form,

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,440
we'll have the form just going down this column,

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,340
we'll have these two links.

00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,320
You can use a lot of different -- you don't have to make something

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,210
that looks like a full-on website.

00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,600
Just mock up where your content is going to go.

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,420
Sometimes I do do full-on designy mockups,

00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,380
but really it's kind of like just doing a wireframe is good enough

00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,669
just so you can see your content and see how people will use

00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:37,820
your website, or whatever you're designing.

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,280
And there's a lot of difference services out there like Balsamiq

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,760
for wireframes that are really great.

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,060
You can use anything; you can use GIMP, Illustrator,

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,640
Sketch, Balsamiq, anything, whatever system works for you.

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,800
Create your boxes and lines and text.

00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,600
Makes it a little bit easier than just jumping straight into HTML.

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,300
Makes it easier to move things around.

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,500
And then build it, of course, which is a whole other presentation.

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,220
My thought process every time I sit down to design is this.

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,380
Every single time.

00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,920
I feel like every time I sit down and I start sketching,

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,180
it's just, like, this awful, awful experience,

00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,340
like, "Oh my god, I'm a terrible designer."

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,600
And I assure you that if you sit down and design

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,300
and this is your thought process, this does not mean

00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,960
you're a bad designer; it simply means you are a designer.

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,080
So this is only the starting point.

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,740
When you're working on building whatever you need to build,

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,240
remember to reduce visual clutter.

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,640
You can do that by keeping the number of fonts and colors low,

00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,220
adding white space, lining things up,

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,100
making sure your content is short and easy to skim.

00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,860
Make sure that your goal is easy to find and use.

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,880
Keep your content simple, friendly, and to the point.

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,400
And definitely practice, practice, practice.

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,220
Because the more you work on design, the more things that you design,

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,200
the easier it will get.

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,820
So like I said, I'm doing a book on this.

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,660
hellowebapp.com/web-design will get to a form that is --

00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:26,409
I'll send only information about this book,

00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,880
hopefully when it comes out, when I start writing it.

00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,180
Otherwise, thank you very much.

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:42,160
