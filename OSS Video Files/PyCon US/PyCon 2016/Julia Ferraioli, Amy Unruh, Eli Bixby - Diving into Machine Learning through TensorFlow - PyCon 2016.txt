	Speakers: Julia Ferraioli, Amy Unruh, Eli Bixby

Machine learning can be an intimidating subject. In this session, we’ll get practical, hands-on experience with core concepts in machine learning with TensorFlow, an open source deep learning library. We’ll introduce the basics of TensorFlow, including how to ingest and prepare raw data for use, run a variety of algorithms to gain insight from the data, and have some fun with visualization.
