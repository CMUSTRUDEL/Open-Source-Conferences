Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory.
Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques
as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation
for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.
Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.
