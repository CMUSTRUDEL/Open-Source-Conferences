	Speaker: Luciano Ramalho

Python is so consistent that often we can infer the behavior of new objects by assuming they work as the built-ins. The Python Data Model is the foundation of this consistent behavior. This talk presents the construction of Pythonic objects: classes that feel ""natural"" to a Python programmer, and leverage some of the best language features by implementing key protocols of the Data Model.
