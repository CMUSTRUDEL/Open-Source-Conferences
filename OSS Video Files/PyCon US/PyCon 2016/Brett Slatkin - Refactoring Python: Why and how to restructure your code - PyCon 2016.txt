As programs gain complexity, it becomes harder to add features and fix bugs. Reorganizing code is an effective way to make programs more manageable. This talk will show you Pythonic ways to do the most imporant ""refactorings"": Extract variables with __nonzero__; Change signatures with *args and **kwargs; Extract fields and classes with @property; Create stateful closures with __call__; and more!
