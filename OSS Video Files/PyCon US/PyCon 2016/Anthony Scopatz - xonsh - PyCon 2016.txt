	Speaker: Anthony Scopatz

Xonsh is general purpose shell that combines Python and the best features of Bash, zsh, and fish. Relying only the standard library and PLY, the xonsh language is a strict superset of Python that compiles to a Python AST.  The shell provides exciting features such as a rich history, tab completion from bash and man pages, syntax highlighting, auto-suggestion, foreign-function aliases and more!
