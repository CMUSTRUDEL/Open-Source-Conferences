	00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,960
[applause]

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,720
Thank you.

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,360
I'm sure glad no one set the expectations to be very high for this presentation.

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,100
[laughter]

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,580
So, the last hour has been amazing

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,430
simply because my Eigenharp sequence here, quit.

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,500
I've had more hardware failures.

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,240
My laptop has kernel panicked twice in the last 12 hours.

00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,720
My entire presentation disappeared,

00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,640
but I actually found a backup of it that I made last night.

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,340
So this is going to be very interesting.

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,559
Now, one of the things that I think has been amazing about PyCon this year

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,239
is what you see on either end of these giant screens.

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,920
This transcription stuff is amazing.

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,720
I can't imagine trying to do this myself.

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,580
[applause]

00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,800
I can't type that fast or nearly that accurately.

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,780
But I must confess: You know, I'm a biker,

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,780
and I got a little bit of devil in me, so --

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,000
through three cheese trees three free fleas flew.

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
While these three free fleas flew freezy breeze blew.

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,960
Freezy breeze made these three cheese trees cheese freeze.

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,000
Freezy cheese made these three free fleas sneeze.

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,060
All right!

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,060
[applause]

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,420
Okay, let's get started with this.

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,700
If I can get out of my --

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
That’s what I want to see.

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,420
That's up there; that's what I wanted to see.

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,540
In the next five minutes,

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,079
there is going to be a lot of things going on

00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,019
all at the same time.

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,580
Now, any of ‘em could go wrong,

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,520
and I will compensate for them if they do go wrong,

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,259
but what I want you guys to do

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,099
is pay attention to what catches your eye.

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,920
What do you look at?

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,900
What do you see?

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,280
So, let's see.

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,400
[K. Lars Lohn plays bassoon music]

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,940
Okay.

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,920
Got your seat belts on?

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,900
You're gonna need 'em.

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Let's begin.

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,020
Please work.

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,500
[laughter]

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,300
All right.

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,900
[K. Lars Lohn plays classical music in unison with recorded music]

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,520
[applause]

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,320
Thank you, thank you.

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,819
You know, I will always remember

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,339
the day that I first learned to ride a motorcycle.

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,200
It was not because I could have died that day,

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,860
but it was because I started to read

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,960
a most extraordinary and life-changing book.

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,180
This book had been given to me two years earlier,

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,180
but I was too intimidated to read it.

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,520
It’s 800 dense pages, and it’s really tough to get into.

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,720
So I let it sit on the bookshelf for two years.

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,900
But, you know, it glared at me,

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,060
and one day, I decided I needed to start reading it.

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,140
So I picked it up, started reading, got to about page 50,

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,800
and I was ready to put it back on the shelf,

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,840
because I was having a tough time.

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,019
But I persevered, and by the time I got to about page 100,

00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,379
it seemed like only a few moments had passed,

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,000
because the book had reached out and pulled me in.

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,080
The chapter was about recursion

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,640
and the underlying connection in all sorts of different things:

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,960
language, music,

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,940
uh... mathematics.

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,360
There's an underlying theme in all of these different things.

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,280
And it really spoke to my worldview.

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,360
At that point in my life,

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,370
I was living just outside of Glacier National Park

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,350
in Northwest Montana.

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,579
I was working for a small computer company

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,820
that wrote school records software on small IBM machines --

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,810
this was before the IBM PC --

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,830
to do school records software for Indian reservations.

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,040
Well, part of my job

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,680
was also to teach programming at the community college

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,200
for the Blackfeet Nation in the town of Browning.

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,320
It was an interesting job to have.

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,360
I was fresh out of school.

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,980
So, I was reading this book, and I totally lost track of time.

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
I had to teach that night,

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,000
and by the time I realized what was going on,

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I had only 40 minutes to drive the 20 miles to Browning

00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,229
and at the same time come up with a lecture.

00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,200
So, I grabbed all my stuff -- I put my backpack on.

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,410
At the last minute, I took the Gödel, Escher, Bach book

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,930
and put it in my backpack, and I walked out to my car.

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,480
But you know, of course, the car wouldn't start.

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I knew what was wrong with the car,

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,860
and I knew I wasn't gonna be able to fix it in the amount of time that I had.

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,560
So I went over to my landlady's house, Gladys,

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,800
and asked her if she would give me a ride into Browning.

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,980
She was quite unenthusiastic,

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,660
and she was not interested in letting me borrow her car either.

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,660
But she did hand me a set of keys,

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
and said, "Here.

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,620
"Take my son's motorcycle."

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,480
[laughter]

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,680
I told her, "I don't know how to ride a motorcycle!"

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,840
But her response was, "Well, I guess you're not teaching tonight, are you?"

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,620
[laughter]

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,600
And being the responsible person that I am,

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
I realize I'm the teacher, I can't just beg off and not show up.

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,020
So I took the keys out to the bike, and I started to look at it,

00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,080
and I said, "I could do this.

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,040
"It's just like a bicycle; I can ride bicycles."

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,310
And so, I got the bike started.

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,660
Killed it a couple times trying to get it moving forward.

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,680
But I did get it moving forward,

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,340
and went down about the one-mile dirt road

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,250
down to the highway where I was supposed to turn left.

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,000
Well guess what happened?

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Within just a few moments,

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,060
I was sprawled on the asphalt on US Highway 2.

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,260
What had happened was a problem of complexity.

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,740
You see, the motorcycle "user interface" and a bicycle "user interface"

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,460
are similar but not the same.

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,600
At the bottom of the hill, just before the stop sign,

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,750
I skidded on the gravel.

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,540
That caused me to panic.

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,980
I held onto the handle grips tighter

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,120
which meant I inadvertently rolled on the throttle.

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,680
Which, of course, the motorcycle immediately caught traction,

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,620
and I shot onto the highway

00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,600
without so much of a glance in either direction,

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,820
where there would be cross traffic.

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:06,320
I then let my bicyclist instincts take over.

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,520
Now, if I had been on a bicycle in this situation,

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,769
I would’ve leaned hard to the left, locked up my rear tire

00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,839
which would have skid the back end of the bike around,

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,819
I'd be aimed in the right direction,

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,840
and then I'd pedal hard to start moving forward.

00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,820
I tried to do the same thing on the motorcycle --

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,860
minus the pedaling of course.

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,880
But what happened...

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,100
you know that lever on a bicycle on the right hand grip?

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,120
That's the rear brake.

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,500
On a motorcycle, that's the front brake.

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,640
I locked up the front tire, and the bike flipped over.

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,160
Fortunately, it did not land on top of me,

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,320
but I was spread on the asphalt, stunned.

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,580
My glasses had flown off.

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,339
And, you know, I was lying there -- I remember this so distinctly.

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,120
I was looking at the asphalt and looking at all those little cracks

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,209
and thinking about the book that I'd been reading

00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,280
and underlying connections of things.

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,420
And you know those little valleys and mountains in the asphalt?

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,331
They were just like these -- this beautiful valley I was in,

00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:05,391
in Glacier National Park.

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,580
These mountains, these cracks and all that.

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,840
Well, I don't know how long I was staring at the asphalt,

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,260
but I was broken from my reverie by the sound of brum-brum-brum-brum-brum

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:20,910
of a truck downshifting rapidly using its air brakes.

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,910
I looked up, looked around.

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,230
I saw a log truck bearing down on me,

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,300
and I couldn't tell how far away it was.

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,209
I didn't know if I needed to hunker down and hope for the best,

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,090
dash off the edge, or leisurely walk away.

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,250
I didn't know what to do.

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,839
Now we're going to leave me on the asphalt right there --

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,680
[laughter]

00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:45,839
-- because I want to talk about distance and how you measure distance.

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,539
But we're going to also leave US Highway 2 in Montana

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,060
and use a different highway:

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,280
the highway in the video that you saw at the beginning of this talk.

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,220
This is US Highway 30.

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,680
It is the original route of the Oregon Trail.

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,720
You notice, I did not die of dysentery making that video.

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,200
So this is the satellite view of the route that I took in that video.

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,880
I started in the lower left and went up to the top of Rowena Crest --

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm sorry, I started in the lower right --

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,520
up to the top of Rowena Crest in the upper left.

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,440
We'll get the map and just look at the path itself.

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,540
I want to figure out how long that highway was.

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,300
And so I'm going to make a series of estimates to do it,

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,420
and I'm going to use a measuring stick to do it, a ruler,

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,600
and we’re gonna use a giant one to begin with.

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,660
It’s the crow’s flight’s distance from my origin to my destination.

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,920
And rather than using kilometers or miles or something like that,

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm just gonna call them units.

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,160
So, this is our baseline.

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,120
This is one unit of distance,

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,660
and as an estimate of the length of that highway,

00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,680
it's a pretty rotten estimate.

00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,670
You can see I didn’t go around any of the curves.

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,620
It's just a straight line.

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,500
So, I really need to use a smaller ruler.

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,620
Let's divide this ruler into four pieces, 1/4 size.

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,700
I'm gonna define a couple of variables here.

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,320
We're gonna call 1/4 -- we're gonna call that "epsilon."

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,640
So the sub 2 is because this is our second estimate of that distance.

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,340
And then we’re gonna count how many of these rulers it takes

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,339
to follow the route of the highway.

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,529
So we drop one down, the second one drops down,

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,520
the third, the fourth.

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,920
I've run out of the original rulers, but I've got more of them.

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,020
So, it takes six total rulers to cover the highway,

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,360
and you can see it's a pretty rotten estimate, too.

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,320
But the distance it comes up with can be thought of as an equation here:

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,160
the original distance d1 (which is 1) times epsilon sub 2, times n sub 2

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,260
is our distance sub 2.

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,460
And that is 1 1/2, so we got a longer length of that highway.

00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,320
This is a good trend.

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,300
Let's try cutting that thing into eight pieces instead.

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,259
So our epsilon sub 3 is gonna be 1/8.

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,240
We drop all of those down,

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,280
and it ends up taking eight more of them to cover the path.

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,960
So using this estimate, we get a distance of 2 for the highway.

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,160
But again, it's not particularly good.

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,180
You can look at that.

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,880
It didn't even do the first loop there at the beginning in the lower right.

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,860
So, continue on.

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,880
Let’s make this 1/16 instead.

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,340
Now I can do that lower loop in the right,

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,000
and it ends up taking a number of --

00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:37,880
so the distance we measure is 2 3/8 for the distance.

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,320
Well, take it down to 32nd for epsilon.

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,240
The distance we come up with is 2 15/32.

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,860
Let’s take all of these estimates and put them on a chart.

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,370
We notice that each time we used a smaller ruler,

00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,639
the highway got longer.

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,360
So, if we chart it like this (our trial number) on the x-axis

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,810
and the distance we measure on the y-axis,

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,110
it looks like there's a trend here.

00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Are we getting more and more accurate?

00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,060
Perhaps we are.

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,080
As the ruler gets smaller, we get more and more accurate, right?

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,680
We converge on the correct distance for the highway.

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,980
What does your intuition tell you?

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,960
And the progression and colors in that

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,020
should give you a clue that I'm leading you into a trap.

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,880
[laughter]

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,290
Let's look at a different, uh, curve -- or a different highway entirely.

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,210
This is not really a highway.

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,410
This is the Koch curve.

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,540
It's a mathematical construct, and if I want to estimate its distance,

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,980
we’ll start with same initial one, d1,

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,900
and we know we're gonna have to cut it into thirds, at least,

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,200
to cover that highway -- that highway?

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,210
That curve.

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,450
And we find it's going to take four of them, 4/3, to measure this.

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,900
Well, you know, I'm over 50 now, and I have to use reading glasses.

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,940
So I put on my reading glasses,

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,700
and I see that, oh, the Koch curve isn’t really that smooth.

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,880
It’s got these little dimples on it,

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,420
and so I have to cut my ruler by a third again, to a 9th size,

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:24,849
and it ends up taking 16 of those.

00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,840
But I look again with a magnifying glass,

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,820
and it’s got even more little bumps on it,

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,900
and so it's 4/3 to the third power for our third estimate.

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,120
And that's a trend, so I can say in general

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,150
that 4/3 to the nth power

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,910
will be the distance of the nth estimate we have.

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,320
Well what is -- does that converge?

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,540
This is the estimates we came up with for the distance of this.

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,520
And if we chart those,

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,220
and I charted them all the way out to the 39th trial,

00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,680
that doesn't look like it's going to converge.

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,620
In fact, it doesn't.

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,660
We can prove mathematically

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,100
the limit as n approaches infinity of 4/3 to the n --

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,120
that goes to infinity.

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,720
Well, you know, the Koch curve?

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
That's an artificial construct.

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,360
It’s a mathematical thing.

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,960
It’s got infinity built into the definition.

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,840
Our universe doesn't have infinity in it, in its definition, does it?

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,140
There's nothing really in nature like this.

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,840
And, as just an aside, this is called Romanesco broccoli.

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,960
I can’t think of anything that --

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,680
they missed an opportunity to really give this the proper name.

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,880
This should be fibonaccoli.

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,520
[laughter and applause]

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
So, anyway, in general,

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,500
to come up with a distance estimate for something.

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,159
It’s gonna be -- our distance estimate for any given trial

00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,119
is gonna be some function f of n multiplied by epsilon sub n.

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,380
So, what is this f of n?

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,440
Well, obviously, for the Koch curve, it is 4 to the nth power,

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,560
but what is it for some arbitrary line?

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,600
That's an arbitrary line.

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:21,300
So, for Highway -- US Highway 30, the f of n is different for every n.

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,140
It varies for the terrain.

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,200
The geomorphology of the Columbia Gorge (it’s about 60 miles east of here)

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,260
is the Columbia Plateau basalt flows from millions of years ago

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,419
that have been severely modified by the last ice age --

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,819
the catastrophic floods of the Lake Missoula floods.

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,320
Basalt erodes in a very distinct way:

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:51,080
very stark sharp cliffs and level plateaus.

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,669
The way an engineer builds a highway in that type of terrain

00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,149
is very different than one would build a highway in, let’s say, Kansas.

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,210
You end up with a different profile of the highway,

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,360
so f of n for that type of highway in that kind of terrain

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,410
is gonna be different from the one from Kansas.

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,240
But as we get smaller and smaller, even the type of asphalt that we use

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,890
is going to affect that f of n.

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,240
What size is the gravel in the asphalt?

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,460
What kind of sand did they use in that asphalt?

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,640
Have you ever looked closely at asphalt?

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,159
I have.

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
[laughter]

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,100
There's entire landscapes down there.

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,680
Imagine a tiny insect going across that path.

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,100
What route is he going to take?

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,020
He'll have to take a route that is useful for him.

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,040
He can't just go straight across,

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,020
because he's got valleys and mountain ranges to go through.

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,340
On my motorcycle, I did not follow this same path...

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,540
or did I?

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,120
If you think about how the motorcycle tire hit the asphalt,

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,160
there were probably little protruding parts,

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,960
and one part of the tire hit that first

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,030
and then maybe something a little back and off to the right,

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,400
and I'm willing to bet it ends up being a very jagged line

00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,969
as kind of a forward-moving wave.

00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,780
So, how far did I really ride?

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,700
Is US 30 in Oregon infinitely long?

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,420
How come when you came here to Portland,

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,909
you didn't see signs, "Portland infinitely ahead."

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:33,949
[laughter]

00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:43,309
It’s because we stop measuring at a range that is in our domain,

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,309
what's relevant to us.

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,920
We don't have to go measure around every little atom in this thing.

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,769
So it all depends on the length of our measuring stick.

00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:57,689
We stop at a reasonable rate, like the size of car.

00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:59,669
If you measure that highway

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,820
with the size of an 18-wheel truck versus the size of my motorcycle,

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,409
you’d probably get different answers.

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,160
Now, I want you to consider, for a moment,

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,500
agile software development.

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,179
You start by making a first cut of your software.

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,739
You use a measuring stick that is quite long,

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,120
and you end up -- the software you get

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,180
isn't a very good estimate as to what you'll eventually deliver.

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:34,000
Then you essentially get a smaller stick and start adding details to that design.

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
Does Agile converge?

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
Is it an infinite process,

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,380
or do you end up stopping at some point when it is good enough

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,480
in the same way that we measure distance?

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,640
So, think about that for a minute.

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,920
Meanwhile, back in Montana.

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,820
As you can see that I'm here today, it turns out that truck was, well --

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,230
had enough distance to come to a complete stop.

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,030
The trucker got out,

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,820
helped me right the bike on the side of the highway,

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,800
made sure I was okay,

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,220
and I was so embarrassed, I just said, "Please, just go on, go on.

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,570
"This is embarrassing."

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,480
But I got back on that bike, started it again

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,600
and proceeded down the highway.

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,840
I found that as I went through these curves on the highway

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,870
that I could turn to the right just fine.

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,830
It was fun.

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,090
You just kind of lean to the right, and the bike swings around the curves.

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,050
But to the left?

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,410
That's what I did when I crashed.

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,140
All of the sudden, it was frightening to turn to the left.

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,100
I was slowing down a lot --

00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,300
much to the consternation of the people behind me.

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,160
And to the this day -- in fact, if you look at that video again,

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,260
you'll find every time I go around a curve to the left,

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,120
I do it much more slowly than I do going around curves to the right.

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,680
And I gotta tell you, if you're learning to ride a motorcycle,

00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,560
Glacier National Park isn't your best choice.

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,500
[laughter]

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,460
I suppose you could say if do you crash,

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,940
I guess there will be grizzly bears to clean up the mess.

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,740
So, I made it on to work that day.

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,000
I suddenly lost what track slide I'm on.

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,960
Yes, I made it on to work that day and started to give a lecture.

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,980
But now, we're going to talk about complexity.

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,320
And this is the part of the lecture that I wrote last night,

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,860
and so I'm gonna have some surprise slides here.

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,060
So, what is complexity?

00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,120
Can you define what complexity is?

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,600
Most people -- I've been talking with a lot of people in the last two days

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,660
about what complexity is,

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,640
and the only thing in common I've seen is --

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,720
they know it when they see it.

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,200
There are as many measures of complexity

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,800
as there are fields of study.

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,140
The economists have their measures, the botanists have theirs,

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,340
information theorists, programmers,

00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,080
you all know what big O notation is: it’s a measure of complexity.

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm not going to iterate through all of these different measures here.

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
There are just too many to talk about.

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,980
But what is complexity?

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,520
It is always too much of something.

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,440
Too much indirection, too many connections,

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,200
too many variables, too many parameters.

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,960
But I'm willing to bet there is a law of some sort in this.

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,900
I’m not sure what it is.

00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,440
Maybe someday we’ll call it Lohn's Law of Conservation of Complexity.

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,620
But I'm willing to bet that in software,

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,200
when you write something, and want to simplify,

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,480
all you're doing is delegating complexity to somebody else.

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,770
Because I don't think you can really get rid of complexity.

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,230
If what you're attempting to model

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,740
is more complex than the software that you wrote,

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,420
then likely, your model is incorrect.

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,500
Because, your software, inevitably, will be more complicated

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,440
than the thing that you are trying to model,

00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,480
if it's exactly the same, plus some overhead,

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,690
for whatever the language does.

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,880
This, in the world of flowers, is called a Shirley poppy.

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,380
It -- biologists -- or botanists will say it has a certain level of complexity.

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,560
But if you look closely at this, this is not a photograph.

00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,640
This is a drawing that I made about a month ago,

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,580
made from one single line.

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,840
The line branches.

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,800
In other words, it's a maze.

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,150
There's the solution to the maze.

00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,920
Since it is just one line,

00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,400
and there is exactly one path through it,

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,060
it is isomorphic to a binary tree.

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,060
Are binary trees complicated to you?

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,880
Do you find a binary tree complicated?

00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
Someone say yes or no.

00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,160
(audience member) Yes.

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,960
Someone says, "Yes."

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,780
Well, I don't think they are very complicated."

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,680
In fact, if you go and do cyclomatic complexity on a binary tree,

00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,060
there are no cycles in there.

00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,840
It's not complicated.

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,980
But if you take a different measure of complexity --

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,799
one that takes into account not just the nodes of the binary tree

00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,019
but the shape of the path between the nodes,

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,920
like fractal dimension -- this is very complex.

00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,740
It’s a fractal dimension of about 1.95 which is very complicated.

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,650
So, how do you express the curviness of a line?

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,530
Now I'm a biker, and, you know, it's all about the curves.

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,500
And, you know, paddlers, the people who do kayaks,

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,240
they have ways of judging rivers.

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,940
Class five, class six kills you, or something like that.

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,040
But bikers, we don't have a way of saying what a highway is, how curvy it is.

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,180
So I'm going to use fractal dimension.

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,180
So, this is a line.

00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,620
It fits what you learned in high school geometry

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
about what a line is.

00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,640
It’s one dimensional, it’s straight.

00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,500
But, you know, we also call this a line

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,110
even though it is clearly a two-dimensional object.

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,760
We’ve kind of expanded this idea about what a line is

00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,849
in our colloquial world.

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,900
So fractal dimension is a quantity that can be best thought of as

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,340
how fervently a line is trying to be a plane.

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,160
And if you look at this curved line and start zooming in on it,

00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,680
you can see that it really isn't a very straight line --

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,490
or it has much more complexity as you zoom in.

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,560
So fractal dimension is a ratio in the change in detail

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,890
to the change in scale.

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,380
For the Koch curve, it's the log of n, over the log of epsilon --

00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
remember, the negative of that.

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,680
So, capital D is fractal dimension.

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,720
So, log of 4 over the log of 1/3 --

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,120
the negative gives a fractal dimension of 1.26.

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,500
In terms of a line trying to be a plane, the Koch curve isn't trying very hard.

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,620
But there's no simple formula

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,170
to come up with the fractal dimension of real world phenomenon,

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,580
but there is an algorithm.

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,520
It's called the box covering algorithm, and it works like this:

00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:28,749
You take your line and you cover it with a grid of boxes of known size,

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,820
and you count how many boxes the line touches.

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,040
And note the two numbers --

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,340
in this case, 46.

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,120
Then I take a different box size; Here, I've cut them in half.

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,920
Now 50 pixels in size -- and count those numbers, 106.

00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Box size 25 gives me 247,

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,460
and box size 10 gives me 863.

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,560
If you plot those points as if we had an n and an epsilon,

00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,500
the slope of the line is fractal dimension.

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,710
Now, I don't know if you guys in college or anything

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,790
would try and plot things on a graph.

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,790
When I plotted this the first time,

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,990
I expected to see some curved line or something,

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,559
but I was shocked to find a perfectly straight line

00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,750
that I could easily make fractal dimen-- or get the slope of to get fractal dimension.

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,639
So, US Highway 30 at the Rowena curves, on the Oregon Trail,

00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,820
has a fractal dimension of 1.28.

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,140
A little bit curvier than the Koch curve.

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,220
Back to Montana.

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,620
I decided that the topic of my lecture that day

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,610
was going to be sorting.

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,170
And this was the early 80s on Apple 2 computers and the language BASIC.

00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:55,250
And the sorting algorithm of the day was the bubble sort.

00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,320
We had talked about loops in the previous lecture,

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,180
and they seemed to have a good understanding of loops,

00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,820
but the moment we put one loop inside another loop,

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,460
my students went blank.

00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:13,389
I tried different analogies, like the odometer on the car:

00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:17,829
the inner loop is the tenths and outer loop is the single miles.

00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:19,869
It didn’t help.

00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:21,860
They still didn't seem to understand,

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,880
and I got frustrated with their not understanding

00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,880
because it seemed so simple to me, but it was complex to them.

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,520
Sometimes complexity is in the eye of the beholder.

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,120
One of my students raised his hand, and said,

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,600
"You know, that's not the way I sort things at work."

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,240
I said, "Okay, how do you sort things at work?"

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,820
and then he blew me away by giving me

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:53,610
the most succinct and clear definition of the recursive partition sort, quicksort,

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,790
that I've ever heard in my life.

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:02,540
And, in fact, I can teach anyone the recursive partition sort,

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,160
using his explanation, in under 60 seconds.

00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:09,139
How many of you when you first encountered quicksort

00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:11,919
found it to be complicated and hard to understand?

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,900
I sure did.

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
Let me clear it up for you.

00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,180
Let’s say we have a bunch of things we’re gonna sort,

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,160
and they’re sitting on a table.

00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,220
We just guess which one’s gonna be in the middle --

00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
push it to the back of the table.

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,320
Then we take what's left, spread them out into two piles,

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,300
move things that are less to one side,

00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,580
move things that are greater to the other side.

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,520
That leaves us with two piles

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,580
that are on opposite sides of the one in the back.

00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,920
Repeat with those two piles and continue to repeat

00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:44,229
until you don't have any piles left.

00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:46,209
There.

00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:53,429
Why is that so simple compared to how we learned recursive -- the quicksort?

00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:57,860
It's because of the language that we learned quicksort in.

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,830
Quicksort is always taught, it seems in my view,

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,860
in the C language.

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,980
That's the letter C, transcriptionist.

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:15,400
So, the C language doesn't have data structures that are --

00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,260
they have arrays, and you have to deal with array indices.

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,760
With quicksort, that obfuscates the algorithm entirely,

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,520
dealing with this swapping idea of the data.

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,240
But that's really irrelevant to the algorithm.

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,860
The algorithm is a beautifully recursive system,

00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,480
and we don't understand it, because we couched the terms in a language

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,630
that made it more complicated than it had to be.

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,940
I was so impressed with this student.

00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,139
Well, I was just totally blown away.

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,059
I went to my backpack, I pulled out the book "Gödel, Escher, Bach,"

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,200
and I gave it to him, and said,

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,410
"I really want to hear what you think of Chapter 5."

00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,620
He looked a little taken aback at this.

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,140
But, no, I went on with my lecture, and the day ended,

00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,520
and I rode my motorcycle, or the motorcycle, home.

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,820
It wasn’t my motorcycle, yet.

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,860
[laughter]

00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,740
Okay, fractal dimension can be used to analyze

00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,589
the complexity of anything that can be plotted or projected into N dimensions.

00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:27,829
It’s really easy to do it on the computer, especially in Python.

00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:34,589
This is the fractal dimension of the music I played in the opening video.

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,680
I took Python,

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,960
I recorded my playing of the piece into a MIDI file.

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,480
I then took Python, loaded the Mido MIDI library,

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,460
which loaded the file.

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,100
I extracted the pitch out of every note that I played.

00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,240
Then I took the Python image library, plotted it on a graph

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,030
and then took a algorithm for the -- box-covering, uh, algorithm that I found online

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,670
and came up with fractal dimension.

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:11,270
So the change in pitch in this particular piece of music was 6.29.

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:18,010
Quite well on the way to being complicated into a second dimension.

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,710
So I have a demo here.

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,750
I'm gonna play another piece of music.

00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,800
And, that didn't advance to where it was supposed to go, of course.

00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,820
So, I will try, and -- yes, please, please work.

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,320
That's better; all right.

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,500
Now this time instead of a bassoon, I'm going to be a flute.

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,380
[K. Lars Lohn plays flute runs]

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,720
Now, uh...

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,140
I am going to take this piece of music, this Vivaldi work,

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,980
and I'm gonna tear it apart before your eyes.

00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,170
I'm gonna show you the different sections in this piece of music

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:06,280
and how each one builds on the complexity in different sections.

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,680
In fact, let's just play it and let you judge for yourselves.

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,800
This may be a different way than you've ever seen music before.

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:22,100
[K. Lars Lohn plays lively classical music in unison with recorded music]

00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,460
No, thank you.

00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,520
[applause]

00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,559
That was a really terrible note to leave you hanging on.

00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,099
The next movement would have resolved that, and I have to fix it for you,

00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,540
otherwise you’ll be hanging on the edge of a cliff.

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,520
[K. Lars Lohn plays classical music]

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,760
[applause]

00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,880
There, now it's more at the end.

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,580
[applause]

00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,680
All right, let's answer some questions that came up in the middle of that.

00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,400
This is the entire piece of music.

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,800
It has a fractal dimension of 1.6.

00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,040
That's really quite complex by fractal dimension standards.

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,960
And the first section, A, is about 140 notes long

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,000
with a fractal dimension of 1.5.

00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,680
But, in the next section, Section B, we made it more complicated

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,500
by putting two notes between every note -- every beat,

00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
instead of just one, like Section 1.

00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,180
But the fractal dimension went down to 1.2.

00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,680
Do you know why?

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,340
Because it happened the composer put those extra two notes in,

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,640
in line with the trend of the notes on the beat.

00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:16,070
So, rather than making it more jagged and complicated, he smoothed it.

00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,710
Look at that graph right there compared to that one.

00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,300
That one is much smoother, so the fractal dimension went down.

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,920
So, isolation of a single dimension of multidimensional data can be deceptive.

00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,720
It can lead to unexpected results.

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,640
Am I detecting patterns in my data,

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,420
or am I detecting artifacts from my rendition of the data?

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,700
If I had -- if you think of musical notes as having a pitch,

00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,120
a duration, a volume level, a change in volume,

00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,760
it's a tuple of a whole bunch of different values,

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,800
and I isolated just pitch and nothing more.

00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,180
If I had used one of the other values

00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,810
or perhaps projected them all out of n-dimensional space

00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:12,230
into a two-dimensional object -- or two-dimensional chart,

00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,860
it would have come up with very different answers.

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,120
Now, I've used fractal dimension in my work at Mozilla.

00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,260
I do the Firefox crash reporting system.

00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,940
And I found that -- how do you do fractal dimension on a program?

00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,500
When Firefox crashes, it sends us a stack trace.

00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
What is a stack?

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,140
It is a list of offsets into memory.

00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,820
That can be plotted on a chart.

00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,820
And I found that as a categorization system,

00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,840
it does some amazing things.

00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,099
I found that you can find two independent sets of crashes

00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:53,039
that appear to be different but have very similar fractal dimension,

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,140
and if you put them together and then look at the source code,

00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,960
the problems came from the same location,

00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,380
even though they appeared to be completely distinct.

00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,780
But, of course, there's also a counterexample.

00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,800
Fractal dimension is a very interesting system.

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,920
Let’s go back to Montana.

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:21,040
I -- next time I went to my class, the student had been badly beaten.

00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,940
He had two black eyes, missing a front tooth,

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,130
and his arm was in a sling.

00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,440
I was disturbed by this, and when class ended

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,860
I asked him what happened, and he wouldn’t look at me,

00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,020
and he didn't answer.

00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,100
So, he never showed up for class again.

00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:55,720
And, I -- by the rules of the college, I had no choice but to fail him,

00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,240
and I felt really bad about that.

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,680
And I don't know what the story was, what had happened.

00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,060
Well, about six months passed at the end of the semester,

00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:12,620
and my landlady Gladys came over, and gave me her son's motorcycle.

00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,640
Said, "Here, sign this."

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
It was the title; she was mad at her son.

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,680
I said, "I can't take your son’s bike,"

00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,780
and she said, "It's in my name; it’s my bike."

00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,040
And then another day passed, and she came over,

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,180
and she was mad at me.

00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,840
And she had my "Gödel, Escher, Bach" book.

00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,140
And she gave it to me and said,

00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,260
"I don't know what you people are doing over at that school,

00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,900
"‘cuz these people don't want it, and they don't need it."

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,500
I suddenly realized

00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:54,590
the book and the student having been beaten were related.

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,340
I gave him that book in front of his peers,

00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,780
and it wasn’t just any book.

00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:09,869
It was a book about three European white men having done great things

00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:14,829
that I suppose people found, on the reservation, to be irrelevant to them.

00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,720
I was devastated.

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,970
I quit my job teaching.

00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,020
And then I spent the next two years living in the area,

00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,300
almost literally wandering the wilderness,

00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,960
thinking about the damage that I had done to that man.

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,140
And I felt really, really bad.

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,920
So fast forward 17 years.

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,440
I kept that book.

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,000
I had loaned it to several people in that time range,

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,140
and I finally decided I need to finish reading it myself.

00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,660
So, I started reading the book

00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,760
and I was annoyed that people had written in it.

00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,380
There were words written in it.

00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,700
You know, there are a lot of patterns in this book --

00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:09,300
games of playing with/doing word patterns to explore recursion and things like that.

00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,780
And I just assumed, "Well look, someone has done these games."

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,940
And so, I went and finished the book.

00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,520
I found it amazing, and it just really affirmed my life view.

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,160
Fast forward another 17 years,

00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,680
and I'm writing this lecture for PyTennessee.

00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,300
And I'm looking at these words again, and I realize, "Wait a minute.

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,900
"This isn't even a chapter about word -- letter patterns.

00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,920
"What are these?"

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,200
And then I noticed those last three letters of that first word, "tsi,"

00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:52,760
and I remember a movie from the 1980s called "Koyaanisqatsi,"

00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,820
a word, apparently, from the Hopi language,

00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,280
and we're in the 21st century.

00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,180
You know you can find a Blackfeet-English dictionary online?

00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,119
Now, I need to be clear about this.

00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:11,290
The words that I found in the book

00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,980
were not exactly the words that I found in the dictionary.

00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,540
And I've only shown you, here, the words from the dictionary.

00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,960
I had to phonetically find the words in the dictionary,

00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,220
because what was written was not exactly correct.

00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:33,560
So, in a chapter about Bach, I found this word or a similar word.

00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,079
It means Western Meadowlark.

00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,240
The Western Meadowlark has a really distinct call.

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,020
I used to be able to whistle it.

00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,880
I'll try here.

00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,840
[K. Lars Lohn whistles the Western Meadowlark bird call]

00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,020
Two notes, up a fifth.

00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,740
It is exactly what was talked about in the Bach section of the book.

00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,280
Then I found this word in a section about recursion.

00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,220
This is the word for cloud.

00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:13,240
And then, the words that I initially found near the end of book was this.

00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,160
And on reading it -- or translating it, I was stunned.

00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,620
It was a message from 30 years ago...

00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,760
...Was I absolved?

00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,960
I don't know, but I was moved.

00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,140
And just as he was grateful

00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,140
for the opportunity to read this book,

00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,140
I am very grateful for having this honor to speak before all of you,

00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,540
‘cuz it truly is an honor, and I found it totally unexpected.

00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,020
So I want to close with just a question for all of you.

00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,920
If you think about the path that your life has taken or is taking,

00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,420
what is the fractal dimension of your life

00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,620
and how many left turns have you made?

00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,220
Thank you very much.

00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:36,960
[applause]

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,180
Oh, come on, you're going to make me tear up now.

00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,300
[chuckles]

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,300
Thank you so much.

00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,720
Someone pull me offstage.

00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,700
