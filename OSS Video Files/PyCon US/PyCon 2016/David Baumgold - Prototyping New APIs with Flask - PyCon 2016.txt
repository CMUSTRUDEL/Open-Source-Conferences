You need to build a new API, but which tools do you use? Flask is a microframework that makes web development a snap, and an ecosystem of extensions and other tools has grown around it to make it perfect for prototyping APIs. In this talk, we'll see how to get started with Flask, and learn the best parts of its ecosystem for API development.
