Title: Felix Crux   What You Need to Know About Open Source Licenses   PyCon 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-17
Playlist: PyCon 2016
Description: 
	"Speaker: Felix Crux

Anyone who uses Open Source has run into software licenses. Too often, our understanding of this mess of legalese is incomplete, confused, or based on bad assumptions. But we can’t ignore them: licenses govern everything about how we use others’ code — and how they use ours. Come learn the basics of copyright, what different licenses let you do, and why & how you should choose one for your code!

(host) So, welcome everyone.

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,000
We have our next speaker with us, Felix Crux,

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,640
and he'll be talking on what you need to know

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,700
about open source licenses. Thank you. Let's invite Felix.

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,360
[applause]

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,920
(Felix Crux) Hi everybody. Thanks for coming.

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,360
I know there's some really fascinating, exciting talks

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,260
going on right now, so I appreciate that you chose this one.

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,540
I guess you lot are the really serious-minded folks

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,940
that really love legal stuff, like, you're really pumped right now,

00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,440
like, "yeah, let's read some legal licenses!"

00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,100
I don't know, maybe you just figured out that there's more power outlets

00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:38,060
or the Wi-Fi works better in this room or something.

00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,360
Anyway, hi, my name is Felix, and this talk is:

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,080
What You Need to Know About Free and Open Source Software Licensing.

00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,080
And I wanted to talk about this topic because even though

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,980
free and open source software are ubiquitous now,

00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,620
the legalese that makes it all work can be kind of confusing

00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,499
and boring and even intimidating,

00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:02,120
and sometimes you might think it's pointless

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,250
and just a bunch of magic incantations

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,200
that you just have to chant in the correct way

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,140
and hope that everything works out all right.

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,720
But really, it turns out that the core ideas

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,020
that underpin the system are actually pretty easy to understand,

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,620
and if you take the time to do so, like by coming to this talk,

00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,640
it not only helps you see why things are the way they are,

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,140
but actually gives you new tools, new ways to influence and control

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,720
how your software is used, and to help you make sure

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,189
it achieves the goals that you set for it.

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,060
So that's the objective for this talk:

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,360
to learn the basics of how intellectual property law

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,780
(and in particular, copyright) works;

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,040
to understand how licenses are built on top of those principles;

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
and then to enable you to work effectively

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,799
with free and open source software both as a consumer

00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,199
of someone else's work and as a creator.

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,800
This is sort of an overview of what we're going to cover.

00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,560
It's not like you need to memorize it; it's just to anchor you as we go through

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
and to let you know what to expect coming up.

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,159
But broadly speaking, there are the three big themes

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,920
We're going to cover some background, some foundations;

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
we're going to look at some specific licenses;

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,600
and then we're going to talk about some of the related practical concerns

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,460
about implementing and using them.

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,840
But first, a really big, important disclaimer/caveat up front:

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,800
I am not a lawyer!

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,220
And I know, right, that's, like, exactly what you want to hear

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,290
from someone who's giving this talk, like, "Yeah, that's really great,

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,480
"not a lawyer." But yeah, I am not a lawyer.

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,610
I am not an expert in your country's local legal systems,

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,760
and a lot of this stuff varies so much around the world.

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,340
So I'm not speaking on behalf of anyone or conveying legal advice.

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,140
This is general non-specialist background information.

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,700
We're going to cover about 80% of the material

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,360
that around 80% of the lawyers in the home countries

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,130
of maybe 80% of you would probably give

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,510
in response to, let's say, 80% of your questions.

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,520
So we are talking at a high level about what can be a pretty deep subject.

00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,140
But fortunately, that actually covers almost everything

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,120
that you really need to know to operate on a day-to-day basis.

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,060
And if you do really need to know more because you have

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,400
a specific legal question, I'm not bothered.

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,700
You should take that to an actual lawyer because you're not going to get that

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,320
from any talk or reading Wikipedia or the internet or whatever.

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm glad that's out of the way. Let's actually get started

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,870
by looking at what is intellectual property?

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,680
Intellectual property is kind of weird because the term

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,660
covers a whole grab bag of kind of really unrelated things

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,290
that just have one attribute in common,

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:35,020
which is that the law gives the creator of an intangible creation of the mind

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,740
certain rights that it withholds from everyone else,

00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,800
even though there isn't necessarily a physical thing

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,360
that you can protect and hold and keep away from everyone else.

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
It's just ideas.

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
So for this talk, the kinds of intellectual property

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,320
we're going to look at are copyrights, patents,

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,290
and trademarks.

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,820
Copyright is what this talk is mostly about.

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,180
The idea is that to encourage people to make expressive, creative works,

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,860
we have laws that give them exclusive rights to copy,

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,860
distribute, build upon, and modify that work,

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,380
even though there may be no technical restriction

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,330
that would otherwise keep anyone else from doing the same.

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,800
Copyright is given to the creator of a work completely automatically.

00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,520
You don't have to do anything to get copyrights or to keep them.

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,580
That used to not be the case, but for a really long time now

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,460
it's all been fully automatic.

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,060
In particular, you don't need to stick a little bit of text,

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,020
like "copyright ©2016 John Doe."

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,920
You don't need to put that on your work.

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,160
You get the copyright completely automatically.

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,420
And that gives you the right to control how it's used

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,440
for a limited time. Actually, I say "a limited time,"

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,100
and that's the theory, but in practice,

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,460
no copyrights have actually expired in the United States since the '70s.

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,820
Every time that we get close to what would be the new deadline,

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,750
the law gets changed retroactively to extend the duration.

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,390
But that is the topic for another talk.

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,040
Moral rights are a very closely related concept to copyright.

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,880
In some countries, they're considered just a subset of copyright,

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,950
and in some places, they're a little bit different,

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,820
and in some places, they don't even exist at all.

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,920
So they're very vague and they vary a lot from country to country.

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,410
And moral rights are sort of the non-commercial part of copyright.

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,930
It's not so much about making money off of your creation.

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,060
It's about things like the right to be identified as the author,

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,900
or the right to the integrity of the work.

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,120
And "integrity" in this context means keeping people from changing

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,900
or presenting your work in ways that you don't like,

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,500
like putting on a display and defacing your art,

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,520
even if they own it.

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,120
Moral rights also behave differently.

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,320
For example, they might not be time-limited.

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,770
They might actually last forever.

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,860
They might even last beyond your lifetime

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,680
and pass down to your heirs and descendants.

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,770
So your grandkids maybe will have a say

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,150
in what people are allowed to do with your software.

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,300
And in some countries, you cannot waive, reject,

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,520
or give away or sell your moral rights.

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
It's just not allowed,

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,480
like how you are not allowed to agree to be murdered.

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,919
We'll talk a bit more later about the implications of that,

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
and it turns out that yeah, the the fact that in some countries

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,220
you cannot get rid of your moral rights, that turns out to be really important.

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,060
But the next big kind of intellectual property

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,400
I want to talk about briefly are patents.

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,640
Where copyright was about creative works,

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,100
patents are about protecting functional inventions.

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,280
The deal is that you share the details of how your new gizmo works,

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,800
and society in exchange gives you this exclusive monopoly

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,020
on the invention for a little while.

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,780
Now for the purposes of this talk, which is about licensing,

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,580
we're mainly concerned with patents as they relate to sneaky patent trolls

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,630
and some of the tricks that they can try to pull.

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,750
For example, the owner of a patent might try to get

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,420
their patented software technique adopted as part of a standard,

00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,380
so that anyone who implements that standard

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,320
then has to pay them money for a license or risk being sued.

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,640
Or they might even actually themselves contribute the code

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,220
that implements their patented technique,

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,260
and then later, either because they planned this in advance

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,230
or just because they changed their minds,

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,530
they might come back later and try to sue you

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,490
for using that code that they themselves

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,780
contributed to your project.

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,710
So some licenses have protections against this kind of thing,

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,620
and when we talk about those licenses I will call that out specifically,

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,520
because it is a great thing to have in a license.

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,180
Also, as a side note, there's something called a design patent,

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,169
which covers the way a product looks, and that is not the same thing

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,250
as a regular patent. It doesn't work the same way.

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,180
It's not meant to cover the same kind of things.

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,040
But because it also has "patent" in the name,

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,080
you sometimes see people getting confused and angry

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,100
and saying stuff like, "Oh no, so-and-so is trying to patent

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,990
"the rectangle or the color blue!" And if you hear stuff like that,

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,800
don't don't get worked up, just send them a link

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,020
to the Wikipedia page on design patents,

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,940
which are not regular patents.

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,040
Really quickly, last up: trademarks.

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,110
The idea behind a trademark is to protect protect consumers

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,510
from fakes that might be trying to take advantage

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,680
of the good reputation of a particular brand

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,760
by imitating or copying their name or logo

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,660
or identifiers like that.

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,680
Now this doesn't usually come up in software licenses directly,

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,300
but it can definitely be an issue for software projects,

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,020
especially user-facing ones that have brands

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,580
and reputations to protect.

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,960
You might remember that in 2013, the Python Software Foundation

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,820
actually had to fight for the name "Python,"

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,759
and up until very recently earlier this year,

00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,740
the Debian GNU/Linux distribution had to ship Firefox

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,439
under the name "Iceweasel" with a really cute different little blue logo

00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,399
because of disagreements about trademarks,

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,559
even though the licensing of that code was perfectly fine.

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,500
That was a friendly disagreement, though, and both sides had very good points,

00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:55,960
and they've now sorted it all out as of last month, which is great.

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,860
But again, most licenses don't have anything to say about trademarks,

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,860
but you should know what they are because they do come up

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,720
for software projects.

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,880
If you expect end users to be able to recognize

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,000
the name and brand of your project,

00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,990
then maybe spend some time to think about what rights or requirements

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,970
you might want to give to people who fork your code.

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,170
Can they associate that new project with your brand?

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,050
In general, though, just try not to rip off anyone's name or logo.

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,940
There are other kinds of intellectual property as well,

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,060
but they're not really relevant to software licensing,

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,300
so we're just gonna ignore them. That works out well.

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,660
So, why do we need licenses at all?

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,240
Well, intellectual property law is a reality whether you like it or not,

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,720
and since copyright is both so powerful and automatic,

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,220
we have to live with it and operate within its boundaries.

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,619
But it's not just a bunch of restrictions.

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,740
We can actually also work within the confines of the law

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,500
to achieve the outcome that we want for our software.

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
We can use the laws in ways that are beneficial

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,020
and that actually help spread our work.

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,540
So a license is a set of permissions that you give to someone.

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,759
When you create something like a piece of software,

00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,839
you alone have the right to it, and you have control

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,769
over how to share those rights with others.

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,180
And a license is what we use to give people rights

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,380
they wouldn't ordinarily have, like the right to use the software,

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:19,189
to modify it, or to copy and share it.

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,759
Licenses can also be used to set conditions

00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,579
or create obligations.

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,940
The most obvious example is of course proprietary software,

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,049
which generally has a license that only gives you the right to use it,

00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:33,620
but prohibits you not just from copying and sharing it,

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,320
but also from things like reverse engineering it,

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,600
or in some cases even from really wild stuff

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,050
like benchmarking the performance of the software

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,951
and sharing that data.

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,920
Some proprietary database licenses have that.

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,880
And I mean, that's a pretty odious example

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,400
of a requirement in a proprietary license,

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,379
but free and open source software licenses

00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,499
usually also have obligations and requirements that come with them,

00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,749
they're just of a different nature, and we'll look at some of those

00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,869
in a minute.

00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,720
Usually if you don't comply with the obligations

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,009
that a license creates, you lose all the rights

00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,960
that it would otherwise have given you,

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,660
and there might be other penalties on top.

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,600
But the key idea is that without a license,

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,280
no one has any rights to the software, and the license is the thing

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,800
whereby the creator grants those rights.

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
And no, just publishing the source code,

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,180
like by throwing it up on GitHub without a license,

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,399
that does not give anyone any rights.

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,410
That is not code you can use, it's just code

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,429
you happen to be able to look at, like how you can probably see

00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,930
my laptop sitting up here right now and you can look at it,

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,370
but you don't have the right to take it home.

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,520
Without a license, that code is not for your use.

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,779
All right, enough background.

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,139
Let's actually look at some licenses.

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,560
The first category I want to talk about

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,980
are known as permissive licenses, and these are the simplest kind.

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,480
They're often very short, very quick to read through,

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,220
and they almost -- but not quite -- but they almost just say

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,280
that you can do pretty much whatever with the software.

00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,480
You can even build proprietary code

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
on top of the the code that's been shared.

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,620
You usually just have to provide attribution,

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,240
meaning you have to give credit to the person who wrote it,

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,040
and there's often --

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,540
or usually there's also a warranty disclaimer

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,860
that says that the author isn't responsible for what you do

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,480
or how badly you mess up using the code.

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,620
And that is a really good idea to have, by the way.

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,800
You should not use a license that does not have a warranty disclaimer.

00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,080
Now, you would generally pick a permissive license like this

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,580
when your goal is just for the code to be shared

00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,829
and used as widely as possible.

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,999
You're trying to make life as easy as possible for developers

00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,019
by making everything available to them for whatever use they want,

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,160
even if they don't want to reciprocate

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,680
by sharing their improvements back to you.

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,360
That's a very pragmatic approach. It's very business-friendly.

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,980
And having companies who care about improving the quality of your code

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,060
and who can pay people to work on it -- that can be really powerful.

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,620
Just be sure that you really would be OK

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,999
with seeing someone make a lot of money off of your work

00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:01,099
and give you nothing in return, because that can and does happen,

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,400
and it's well within their rights.

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,880
So, people from the communities around these licenses

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,189
usually talk about the term "open source,"

00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,769
not about "free" software, and it's very non-political,

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,459
non-activist. It's about just the practicality

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,649
of the process of developing in the open.

00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:22,849
It's about working more efficiently, not about overthrowing copyright.

00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,869
There are a number of licenses like this.

00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,829
Here's a bunch or a subset of some of the more popular ones.

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,989
These ones here really only differ in minor ways.

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,439
And some are more popular in certain communities.

00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:39,510
So the JavaScript world seems to be fond of the X11

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,110
and the Expat licenses, which are usually just called

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,449
the MIT license, just lumped together,

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,820
which is also very popular with Python devs.

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,280
The BSD folks, on the other hand, like openBSD and freeBSD,

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,620
they unsurprisingly like the BSD license.

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,680
But honestly, all of these are pretty similar.

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,540
If you want to go with this approach,

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,060
read through these -- they're like three paragraphs --

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,981
and just pick one that you like the look of,

00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:04,781
or one that your community uses a lot.

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,480
Just one caution on that suggestion, though:

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,379
don't go too overboard with the idea of just

00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,459
picking what your community uses,

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,520
because right now the cultural fashion is sort of to go very permissive,

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,840
to maybe not even think about the question at all

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,280
and just throw the MIT license on everything,

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,600
but remember that licenses are tools,

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
and different tools serve different purposes.

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,640
These are all good licenses if they do what you want them to do,

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,899
the way that any brand of screwdriver is fine

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,120
if you want to drive a screw.

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,439
But if you actually need to hammer a nail, you should not just grab a screwdriver

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:42,259
just because it happens to be sitting right there.

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,380
So it's worth sitting down and really thinking about

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,300
what you want to achieve with your project,

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,999
and also what you don't want people to do with it.

00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:54,379
So if you decide that you want a permissive license, that's great,

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,160
but you should actually decide that. You should think about it

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,649
and reach that conclusion on your own, rather than ignoring the question

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,029
and picking whatever happens to be popular right now,

00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,060
because the choice does matter.

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,300
All right, end of that side note.

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,000
There is one really popular permissive license

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,760
that is a little bit different, though, and that is the Apache 2.0 license,

00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,349
which is named after the Apache Software Foundation.

00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,680
It's a little more verbose than the ones we just looked at --

00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:22,180
instead of like three paragraphs, it's more like three pages --

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
and it has some kind of slightly annoying requirements

00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,929
about putting notices in files you've changed,

00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,669
but it also has a really important clause that the other ones don't,

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,980
and that is a grant of patent license,

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,540
which, going back to what we talked about earlier about patents,

00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:37,929
this is the kind of clause that I've said is really great to have

00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,689
and that I'd call out, so I'm calling it out now.

00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,589
Right now this is a bit of a wall of text,

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,799
but with a little bit of editing,

00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,119
we can snip it down to just the important parts.

00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,279
So what this clause does is it makes it so that

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,759
anyone who contributes to the code is also granting

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,430
everyone who uses the code a license to use any other patents

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,560
that would otherwise be infringed upon by the code that was contributed.

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,040
So this is exactly a patent-troll-killing

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,140
anti-patent-ambush clause.

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,960
And it actually goes even further and says that if you do

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,260
sue anyone over patents related to this software,

00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,649
then you actually lose all of those patent licenses

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,069
that everyone else granted to you.

00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,910
So it's almost like a mutually assured destruction

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,860
where if you start a patent war,

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,339
you're opening yourself up to the same kind of retaliation.

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,120
Now, do you need that for your software?

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,420
It can never hurt. It's never a bad thing.

00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,639
But sometimes maybe you want to use a different license

00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,559
because it's popular in your community

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,760
or because you don't want to have to deal with the requirements

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,440
about notices of modification or whatever,

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,860
so you just have to think about whether your particular project

00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,690
is really susceptible to patent issues.

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,600
Things like video codecs, for example, if you work with those,

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,420
those are a minefield of patents.

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
But honestly the whole software patent field

00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:57,660
is so full of noise that it's hard to tell

00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,900
what might or might not be dangerous.

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,999
But definitely if you're working with anything that's high risk,

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,560
I strongly recommend you use a license with a patent grant clause,

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,920
and among the permissive licenses,

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,060
Apache 2.0 is the best one in that regard.

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,200
The second major family of licenses that I want to talk about

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,420
are the copyleft ones.

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,320
Historically this is the category

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,340
associated with the free software movement,

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,490
which is the activist and political part of the community.

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,080
It's also really the origin of most of this movement,

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,600
so, you know, have some respect for your elders.

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,700
These days, maybe some of the revolutionary zeal has fallen away

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,120
and people are focusing more on the practical benefits

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,940
of developing in the open,

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,360
but it's worth understanding where all this came from

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,860
and what the creators of these licenses intended.

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,460
So, the motivation behind a copyleft license

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,040
is to promote user freedom.

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,400
It's not to make life easy for developers.

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,980
It is not to let you bootstrap your startup faster.

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,780
It is not to invite collaboration from industry,

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,620
although, you know, all of those things can and do happen, and that's great,

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,080
but the goal is really to guarantee that users

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,130
have the the so-called "four freedoms":

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,680
the freedom to use the program as you wish for any purpose,

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,860
the freedom to study it and change it,

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,760
the freedom to share your program,

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,460
and the freedom to redistribute your changes as well.

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,620
Now to guarantee those freedoms,

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,560
the central idea that makes a license a copyleft one

00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,769
is that it requires you to share the changes you make

00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,069
under the license terms that others shared them with you.

00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,660
This ensures that even if many people layer changes

00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,940
on top of the code you've released under a copyleft license,

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,300
the end users of that product

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,040
will still have those freedoms that you wanted to give them.

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,260
Copyleft licenses don't prevent you from making commercial software,

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,260
but they do prevent you from making proprietary software.

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,980
Now, unlike permissively licensed code, which people can take

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,140
and do incorporate into closed-source software,

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,540
copyleft code spreads copyleft to other code that mixes with it.

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,100
This also means that you can incorporate permissively licensed code

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,790
into a copyleft project, but not the other way around.

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,530
This property is sometimes described as "viral."

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,850
People say that copyleft "infects" code

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,440
and "spreads" in this way, and I think they mean for that

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,420
to sound scary and dangerous and threatening,

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,360
but an organically growing viral spread of free software

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
is exactly the point of these licenses.

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,220
That is what they're meant to do.

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,460
And you don't have to use them, you don't have to agree --

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,300
you don't even have to agree with them,

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,220
but you have to respect them.

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,180
And if your goals with your project

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,240
are aligned with the free software movement,

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,460
then these are probably the licenses that you want.

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,840
The first and most well-known license in this category is the GPL,

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,010
the GNU General Public License.

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,220
And everything I said a moment ago about what copyleft is

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,020
is really what the GPL is,

00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,380
because the GPL created and defines this whole category.

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,320
One key thing about it

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,620
that makes it different from some of the other licenses

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,460
is that the viral clause that requires you to share your code

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,040
only kicks in when you redistribute the software in some way.

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,540
If you just make a local copy and change it for your own use

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,160
and don't give it to anyone, you're not required

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
to share those changes.

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,380
The GPL disallows you

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,389
from adding other restrictions to the licensing of the software,

00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,380
and that's how it guarantees that the code stays free.

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,560
And that obviously means you can't combine GPL code

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,590
with code that's under a license that's more restrictive than the GPL,

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,320
because either you'd have to violate the GPL

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,280
by imposing additional restrictions, which it forbids,

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,200
or you'd have to violate the other license

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,740
by not imposing the additional restrictions that it requires.

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,510
This is mainly an issue with the older version of the GPL

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,580
that you still find a lot in the wild, the GPL version 2,

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,299
which most notably is not compatible with the Apache license

00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,139
that we just called out as being so good

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,960
because of that excellent patent clause, which,

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,920
even though it's a good restriction, it's an extra restriction,

00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,520
and the GPL doesn't allow that.

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,500
Version 3 of the GPL, however, fixes this by also including that clause,

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,160
so it's no longer an extra restriction.

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,620
So GPL version 3 is both more compatible

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,830
and it includes patent protections like the Apache 2.0 license.

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,220
So if you want to use the GPL, you should use version 3,

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,540
and even a lot of things that were originally licensed under version 2

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,780
are actually licensed under "version 2 or any later version,"

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,180
which is the standard recommended way to use the GPL

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,600
and lets you use version 3.

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,240
There is a closely related license called the LGPL.

00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Interesting.

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,009
I have lost the ability to move my slides.

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,360
Oh, there we go.

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,360
This works.

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,880
The LGPL, the Lesser GNU General Public License.

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,960
It differs from the regular GPL in that the virality aspect

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,540
only applies to the specific code it's attached to,

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,559
not anything that's just linked to it

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,159
to build a larger software application.

00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,319
So you can have an LGPL library

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,440
as part of even a proprietary application,

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,220
and you only have to share your changes to the LGPL part.

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,660
It does also come with some requirements

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,000
that are intended to make sure that users can always take advantage

00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,230
of the LGPL nature of that linked library.

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,330
So essentially, users have to be able to replace the version

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,409
that you've shipped with whatever version they want,

00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,830
which -- maybe that's a newer version from upstream

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,669
or maybe they have their own custom version or whatever.

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:07,160
The idea is that even if you ship a non-free proprietary application,

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,880
if it's built on top of an LGPL library,

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,870
then users will always have the freedom to control

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,929
what version of that library they use,

00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,860
so they can maybe keep it up to date

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,400
even if you've stopped supporting it,

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:23,009
or they can change behavior that they just disagree with you about.

00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,709
The third big license in this category --

00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,780
and to be totally clear, there are lots of others,

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,060
but these are the big ones.

00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,200
But the third one I want to talk about is the AGPL,

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,500
the Affero General Public License.

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,680
And the newest version of this is actually based on the GNU GPL,

00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,480
and so all of these form one big happy family.

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,140
And this particular license was created

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,500
what some people might perceive as a loophole in the regular GPL.

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,140
The GPL requires that you redistribute your source

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,740
to anyone to whom you've distributed the application.

00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,640
But there's a big category of software

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,660
that never actually gets distributed to its end users,

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,540
and that's networked applications,

00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,800
servers that users only interact with remotely

00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,680
through a client like a web browser.

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,580
And these are obviously still big, complex applications

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,200
that end users are using and which they rely on

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,080
just as much as any desktop application,

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,720
but technically, the software was never distributed to them.

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,440
It's just running on the service provider's server somewhere.

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,679
So the GPL's sharing requirements don't kick in,

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,500
even if the code that was running on that server

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,020
is GPLed and meant to be shared.

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,900
So the AGPL fixes that.

00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,000
It's very similar to the GPL, but its sharing requirements kick in

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,780
even for users that just access the application over the network.

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,660
And that definitely scares some people, but again,

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,779
remember that different licenses are used to achieve different goals

00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,299
according to what the creator wants,

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,360
and these copyleft free software licenses

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,460
are deliberately very aggressive vehicles

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,500
for ensuring the independence of users from developers

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,760
and service providers that they would otherwise be reliant on.

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,980
And as developers, that obviously is a bit scary for us,

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,120
but think of, you know, who are you building this software for?

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,620
AGPL, LGPL, and GPL version 3: all compatible with one another,

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,679
all compatible with a lot of other licenses.

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,979
You can build an application that combines all of these.

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,600
Not the case for older versions.

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,740
Now, maybe you're looking at these choices

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,630
and your head is kind of spinning and you're thinking, like,

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,789
"Augh, this is a mess! I don't know what to do."

00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:37,449
Or maybe even raging, like, "I hate copyright law!"

00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,480
And you conclude that you don't care about licensing,

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,360
and what you want to do is just throw the software out there

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,460
and let anybody do whatever they want, no license.

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,560
Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,800
Just like you can't opt out of other laws that you don't like --

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,640
I mean, I'd love to not have to pay for cheeseburgers,

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
but I can't just go into a McDonald's and declare,

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,970
"I'm a sovereign entity that doesn't believe in private property,"

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,080
and hope that they give me free burgers.

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,549
So if you don't have a license, no one has any rights to the code,

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,060
even if you wish they did and even if you put it up on GitHub.

00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,460
Now, some people still argue, like, "Oh, but it doesn't matter

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,760
"because I'm not gonna sue anybody or do anything like that."

00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,929
"You can use my code." Great.

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:16,829
That's really nice of you to say.

00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:21,120
Please, put that promise in writing and distribute it with your code,

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,460
preferably in a file named "license."

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,960
Except don't use your own words, just pick one of the licenses

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,140
that we talked about earlier. It'll save us all a lot of trouble,

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,300
and honestly, it is not that much work.

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,300
Now, some of you are thinking at this point,

00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:41,500
"What about the public domain? Can I just put my stuff

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,120
"in the public domain and forget about licenses?"

00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,799
And for those who don't recall, the public domain is what we call

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,070
things that are outside of copyright,

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,140
either because the copyright has expired,

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,560
or it wasn't eligible for copyrighted protection

00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,180
in the first place, or it was deliberately set free in this way.

00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,580
And yeah, you will encounter a lot of things out there

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,920
that are attempting to sidestep the whole issue

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,560
by more or less placing things in the public domain.

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,179
Some examples of this are the Unlicense

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,960
and Creative Commons Zero.

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,200
This is much better than nothing,

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,720
but overall, I still can't really recommend it.

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,960
At the very least, you should protect yourself

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,559
by including the warranty disclaimer language

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,240
that licenses usually have. Even the Unlicense website,

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,540
which is a militant anti-license site,

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,720
even they suggest that as an option.

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,450
Unfortunately they hid it away in the frequently asked questions,

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,500
so it's a bit hard to find, but even they agree

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,240
that you should have a warranty disclaimer for code.

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,240
But the reason I can't recommend the public domain approach

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,180
has to do with those moral rights that we talked about earlier

00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,179
in the intro to intellectual property section

00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,000
when we talked about copyright in general,

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,900
and moral rights are the ones like the right to attribution.

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,040
And in some places they are irrevocable and forever.

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,560
And I promised we'd talk more about that later;

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,900
well, later is now, and this is why they matter.

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,960
When you say that you're putting something into the public domain,

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,240
or that people can do literally anything,

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,940
you're trying to give up those moral rights,

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,460
and in some places, that is just not something

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,120
that the law lets you do --

00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,540
again, just like you can't sign a contract agreeing to be murdered.

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,780
The law actually limits what actions you can take

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,760
that it believes are detrimental to you,

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,680
and usually this is put in place for really good reasons.

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,960
It's to protect against coercion, to protect against exploitation.

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,720
It just happens to work against us in this case

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,200
when we're doing it voluntarily.

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,720
So when you attempt to give up the moral rights

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,009
that you can't give up, you're creating a legal uncertainty

00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:49,240
and a risk that the whole public domain dedication you put up there

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,380
is going to get thrown out, and your software will be treated

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,840
as if you didn't give anyone any rights at all,

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,040
because legally, that public domain dedication,

00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,980
depending on where you are in the world,

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,919
might not be a meaningful, coherent document.

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,760
It might be null and void nonsense.

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
The Creative Commons Zero authors are actually aware of this problem,

00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:10,289
and if you read the full text of the CC0

00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:13,020
instead of just the marketing blurb,

00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,760
it's really actually first a public domain dedication

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,660
followed by a full regular permissive license,

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,840
with a little note that says, like,

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,780
"If the public domain stuff doesn't work and isn't allowed,

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,480
"here's a license." But if you're gonna do that,

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,409
you might as well just have gone with a regular license

00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:32,280
in the first place.

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,539
Now, to be honest, this is mainly an issue outside of the United States

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,120
in places with legal systems like the United States.

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,640
But even if you are American, writing code in the USA,

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,519
please don't make life harder for people

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,720
just because they come from a country with a different legal tradition.

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,100
Or even if they're American as well, they might operate

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,540
in a country with a different legal tradition.

00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,860
So at the end of the day, choosing something like the Unlicense

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,710
might feel a bit like it's an anti-copyright political statement,

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,600
and I can sympathize with that, but really,

00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,279
you're just creating difficulty for people in other countries,

00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,820
and you're not gaining anything that you wouldn't get

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,000
by just using a very permissive standard license.

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,620
Please think of your European colleagues and use a proper license.

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,700
And on that note, I'll also ask

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,500
that you please pick an existing license.

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,800
Don't write your own.

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,380
Yeah, the slide is pithy and kind of says it all,

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,540
and I'm tempted to just leave it at that, but I'll explain why.

00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,840
Sometimes people correctly understand that they need a license,

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,340
but they also think that their situation is somehow really unique

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,760
and that they have to make up their own new license.

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,460
Or more likely, they have to give a pile of money to a lawyer

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,340
who will happily accept it in exchange for doing minimal work

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,240
by just rephrasing the same stuff

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,960
that's already in every other license.

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,159
Because the truth is, there is already a license out there

00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,920
for every need you can think of. Find one that works for you.

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,280
Every new license that shows up in the world

00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,180
just makes a lot of extra work for developers and lawyers

00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,740
who have to evaluate it and figure out whether it's compatible

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,760
with all of the other licenses they're using.

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,100
Grows, you know, exponentially, and it imposes this very real cost,

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,780
and you lose out on the benefits of using common licenses,

00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,460
like shared legal precedence and the common understanding

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,309
and goodwill that the community around those existing licenses

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,280
have built up.

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,020
You can see an example of how this plays out

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,040
with Douglas Crockford's well-known JavaScript tools like JSLint.

00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,100
And the license to those are pretty standard,

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,080
except that they have the extra line,

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,960
"The software shall be used for good, not evil."

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,020
Now admittedly, that is pretty hilarious,

00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,240
but the practical upshot of it is that Debian, Fedora,

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,300
the GNU project, and a bunch of others

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,280
can't carry and redistribute that from their repositories

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,840
because both -- obviously they don't have control over how end users

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,950
are going to use that software, and because it's incompatible

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,960
with the freedom that they want to guarantee

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,220
to let users use it for any purpose, including evil.

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,120
However, there is one organization that can redistribute that code,

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,220
and that is IBM,

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,320
because IBM's lawyers got a special exemption

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,200
where they got Douglas Crockford to put in writing,

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,280
"I give permission for IBM, its customers, partners,

00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,400
"and minions to use JSLint for evil."

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,420
And yeah, again, that is hilarious, but IBM is right, here.

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,640
Good for them. Good for them. They are protecting their users,

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,680
and they're making sure that their users aren't going to

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,640
end up in front of a jury somewhere arguing about

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,740
whether their business practices or their political activism

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,480
or whatever they're using their code for, arguing about

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,740
whether they're evil or not. Would you want to, you know,

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,080
try to convince people who may disagree with you fervently

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,500
about whether you've ever done anything evil?

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,460
But the whole thing represents a bunch of work,

00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,960
a bunch of pain, a bunch of wasted effort,

00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,280
that could just have been totally avoided

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,880
by sticking to a standard license.

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,200
And even after all that,

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,560
JSLint is still being obsoleted by JSHint,

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,160
partly because it has a better license.

00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,240
And that's how it works for a big-name famous person

00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,360
like Douglas Crockford; if you're just starting out

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,000
and your project is obscure, the most likely outcome

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,420
is that your software will just be ignored.

00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,160
People will be uncomfortable with it because of the weird license

00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,799
and just won't use it.

00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,260
So pick an existing, well-understood common one,

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,920
and put your jokes somewhere else that's not the license.

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,500
Now, so far we've been focusing on code,

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,880
but projects are usually a lot more than that.

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,660
At the very least, there's documentation.

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,660
There is documentation, right? You do have documentation? OK, good.

00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,380
But also there's logos, there's tutorial videos,

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,620
there's all kinds of non-code things,

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,840
and often all of that is just distributed

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,540
under the same terms as the software, which is usually fine.

00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,340
Nothing wrong with that. You can do that.

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,840
But remember, licenses are tools

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,800
that we can make use of to further our goals,

00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,280
and the goals that we have for non-code things

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,060
might be different from the goals for code.

00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,200
For example, your code might be under a copyleft license

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,720
that requires people who modify it to share their source,

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,080
and that makes a lot less sense for a video tutorial

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,940
or even for documentation.

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,680
So you should be aware that you can license that stuff differently,

00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,380
under terms that are more suitable to that kind of work.

00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,580
On the copyleft-like side, there's the GFDL,

00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,120
the GNU Free Documentation License,

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,260
which works kind of like the GPL except it's not for code.

00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,800
And then there's the whole Creative Commons suite,

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,360
which has a really nifty, clever mechanism where you can

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,400
pick and choose exactly how you want your license to work.

00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,800
They have these four atoms that you can combine:

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,120
attribution (meaning people have to give you credit),

00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,900
noncommercial (meaning people can't make money off your work),

00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,060
no derivatives (meaning people can't change your work),

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,300
and share-alike (meaning that if people do change your work,

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,460
they have to release it under the same license).

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,780
And you can combine any of those to make your own license,

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,120
except attribution is not optional because of the moral rights issues,

00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,740
and share-alike and no derivatives are mutually exclusive.

00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,740
So to sum all of that up, you might have something like

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,260
"Creative Commons (attribution, share-alike),"

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,440
meaning you have to be credited as the author,

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
and all changes have to be shared under the same terms.

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,600
And that's like a copyleft license.

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,500
Or you might have a license where you say,

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,520
"Commercial use is prohibited, but otherwise, do whatever,"

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,400
and that's like a hippie license. But it's up to you.

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,280
And these options work really well for stuff that isn't code.

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,160
And at the end of the day, you should just know about them

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,200
so that you can deploy them strategically when you need

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,860
to help your project succeed. Different tools for different jobs.

00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,780
Now, so far we've talked a lot

00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,220
about how to share something that's entirely your work with the world.

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,260
What about things other people are contributing?

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,040
Or what about when you're just adding a small piece

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,220
to an existing code base?

00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,540
There are a few options to be aware of.

00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,260
At one end, at one extreme, there's copyright assignment,

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,480
and this basically means that the owner or manager

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,310
of a software project wants contributors to actually

00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,900
give them the ownership of that copyright --

00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,040
not just license them to let them use it,

00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,840
but actually make them the copyright holder.

00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,460
Unless you really, really, really trust the manager of that code base,

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,420
this is not something you should agree to.

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,200
It just puts you in a really ugly situation

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,140
where the owner of that repository

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,720
can do things like take the entire code base proprietary

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,740
and lock you out of your own work.

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,480
There are some exceptions, like if you have some really specific,

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,760
targeted reason that you want that person to own it,

00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,680
like if you have an agreement with the Free Software Foundation

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,110
that they're going to bring a GPL enforcement lawsuit.

00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,600
That is not a common situation, and if you're in that situation,

00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,180
you know enough to make your own decisions.

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,740
A bit less extreme is something called a Contributor License Agreement,

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,940
a CLA, and this is just a document that you might have to sign

00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,860
before the project owner will accept your code.

00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,940
You still keep the copyright, but there's a specific agreement

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,440
in place that covers what rights they have,

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,940
how they can distribute your code, and so on.

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,920
These are a bit of a hassle because you have to usually

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,490
actually sign something, but they can be OK.

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,060
They can serve valid reasons. But they do vary a lot,

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,560
so it's impossible to generalize about whether they're good or bad.

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,840
You're just gonna have to read the specific one you're presented with

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,700
very carefully and decide whether you're okay with it.

00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,020
By the way, the Python Software Foundation one

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,380
that covers contributing to Python: it's fine. It's good.

00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,720
Nothing weird in there.

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,040
Finally, the most lightweight option (and in my opinion the best one)

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,580
is something called the Developer Certificate of Origin, DCO.

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,820
And this is something the Linux kernel project came up with,

00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,600
and it's basically just a statement where you say that yes,

00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,360
you have the right to submit this code to the project,

00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,700
either because you wrote it or because the person who did

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,780
said that you could, and yes, you agree that the project

00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,260
can distribute it under the same license as their other code.

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,780
It's very lightweight, very low-hassle.

00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,440
There's no signing of paperwork. You just say, "Yes, I agree to this."

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,370
In fact, for projects using Git for version control,

00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,900
you can even have Git automatically tag your commits with your sign-off.

00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,380
And what this provides is protection for the project.

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,160
If it turns out that you lied and you're trying to sneak in code

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,320
that you shouldn't have, that's now on you,

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,420
because the project had good reason to believe

00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,400
that this was code that they could use, because you said it was.

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,260
It protects maintainers both from malicious actors

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,160
and from simple accidents

00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,820
that someone might try to capitalize on later.

00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,380
It also makes it guaranteed and explicit

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,820
that they're allowed to incorporate your code and redistribute it,

00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,000
instead of just implicit because they think

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,860
that you sent them that patch that they think you wrote.

00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:06,200
And as all Python developers know, explicit is better than implicit.

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,120
You can easily adopt this for projects that you maintain.

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,060
You just have to ask people to agree

00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,970
to those very short little assertions.

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,410
Just search for "Developer Certificate of Origin"

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,350
and it comes up, and it's four paragraphs

00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,860
or something like that, very small.

00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,900
So now, we've covered the core ideas of intellectual property law,

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,400
and we've covered sharing your code, accepting contributions from others,

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,560
practical things to keep in mind,

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,580
and that is pretty much what you need to know

00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,000
about free and open source software licensing.

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So to wrap it up, I'll ask that you please pick a license,

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,160
and when you do that, pick a license that's already established,

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,860
proven, and in wide use.

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,660
The Open Source Initiative, the Free Software Foundation,

00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,740
choosealicense.com --

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,720
they all maintain really good online resources

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,440
with lists of licenses, their details, things to keep in mind.

00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,080
So just do some research there.

00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,900
And pick a license that makes sense in your community.

00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,900
For example, PERL developers tend to use the artistic license.

00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,180
There are other licenses that for all practical purposes

00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,200
are totally equivalent, but if you want to integrate

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,100
with that community, that's the one you would choose.

00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,720
And pick a license that's appropriate to the nature of the work.

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,620
Consider Creative Commons or GFDL for things like documentation,

00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,020
and do use a real, full license with a warranty disclaimer for code,

00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,390
and if you're at risk of patent issues,

00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,140
one with a patent license grant.

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,280
And pick a license that furthers your goals for the software.

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,100
If you want to make life easy for developers and be business-friendly

00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,600
and generally be very permissive, consider a permissive license

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,540
like Apache 2.0 with its patent clause.

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,520
And if on the other hand you want to protect users

00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,320
and make sure that the free commons of software continues to grow,

00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,880
consider a copyleft license like the GPL, LGPL,

00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,460
or AGPL version 3.

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,040
But above all, I hope that you will now feel

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,920
more comfortable navigating software licensing,

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,900
and I hope you'll care about the subject,

00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,730
and I hope you'll care about how licenses can be tools

00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,060
that can work for or against you,

00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,140
and I hope you'll think about how to license your software

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,620
instead of doing nothing or guessing at a default,

00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,820
and I hope that you'll find ways to make this work for you

00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,870
and that it will actually help you, it'll help you accomplish

00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,620
what you set out to do when you first sat down,

00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,200
started your project, and wrote that first

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,400
creative and copyright-protected line of code. Thank you all.

00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,180
[applause]

00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,700
Oh, I guess my mic isn't -- is this on?

00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,010
Yeah, this is how to contact me. I'd love to chat with all of you.

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,130
I'd love to hear if I didn't cover something,

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:57,720
or you would have liked to hear about something in more depth.

00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I'll be around all conference and afterwards also.

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,240
