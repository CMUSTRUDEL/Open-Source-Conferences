Title: Chelsea Voss - Oneliner-izer: An Exercise in Constrained Coding - PyCon 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-01
Playlist: PyCon 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Chelsea Voss

We'll describe the ideas and implementation behind Oneliner-izer, a ""compiler"" which can convert most Python 2 programs into one line of code. As we discuss how to construct each language feature within this unorthodox constraint, we'll explore the boundaries of what Python permits and encounter some gems of functional programming – lambda calculus, continuations, and the Y combinator.
