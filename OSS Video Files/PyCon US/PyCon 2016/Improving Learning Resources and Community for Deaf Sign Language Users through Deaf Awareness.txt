Title: Improving Learning Resources and Community for Deaf Sign Language Users through Deaf Awareness
Publication date: 2016-06-01
Playlist: PyCon 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Sarah Jessica Leivers

Deaf people are underrepresented in programming roles and in the wider CS community. There are extra obstacles that Deaf people face when learning to code and integrating/networking within the industry. Python might be ideal for teaching Deaf people to program, and with the help of some Deaf Aware Pythonistas, the Python community might be the ideal place for Deaf programmers to feel included.

[applause]

00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,180
(Sarah Jessica Leivers) Hi, can you hear me? Cool.

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,220
Okay, all right. Cool.

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,260
As you've just been informed, my name is Sarah Jessica Leivers,

00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,340
and why I'm interested in giving this talk:

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,450
firstly, I recently-ish made a career change

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,720
into what I'm doing now, web development.

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,120
I've been involved in the Deaf community for quite a while,

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,480
so that's sort of two overlapping interests, really.

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,070
I've never met a Deaf developer in person.

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,520
I have met a few online, but I'm still hoping

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,320
to meet one face to face soon.

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,460
I just thought I'd also share what this talk isn't.

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,740
I'm not an academic, I'm not a researcher,

00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,140
I'm not presenting any methodology,

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,440
and I'm certainly not suggesting I know best practice,

00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,980
but I am sharing some stories and some ideas

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,880
based on my experiences and interests.

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,080
The sharp-eyed among you

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,480
will have noticed major abstract revision,

00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,460
and the original abstract was quite grandiose

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,400
for what I could possibly cover in half an hour.

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,360
I do hope, though, that you will leave with an understanding

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,960
of what you could do to help Deaf developers,

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,720
or would-be Deaf developers, feel more welcome and included

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,980
in your local Python and wider programming communities.

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,340
Almost 14 years ago, I went to a sixth form college

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,660
to study my A levels.

00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,400
A levels are the single-subject exams

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,180
that most students in England and Wales

00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,100
sit to gain entry to University.

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,960
Most people take three to five of these; they're hard.

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,460
On top of these subjects we were taking,

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,460
we were required to take an enrichment class.

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,980
This was supposed to be a course in something

00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,340
completely separate to what we were studying.

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,380
The idea was to show universities how well-rounded we were as students.

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,380
My fellow students and I bemoaned the fact that we had to do this.

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,540
After all, it was extra work, an extra class,

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,780
and attendance took up our time

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,100
and it had nothing to do with what we wanted to do

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,800
with our lives after all, did it?

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,920
There were lots of courses we could choose from.

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,200
They included pottery, life drawing, jewelry making;

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,560
there were lots of sporty options that I definitely wasn't interested in.

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,640
And I remember I selected the four least --

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,060
well, the four least unappealing from the list,

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,120
because I didn't want to do any, and I was soon notified

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,940
that I'd been enrolled on Introduction to British Sign Language.

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,780
Since attendance was compulsory, I went along to my first class

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,900
and waited along with my classmates for the teacher to arrive.

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,120
The teacher arrived, and I could only describe

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,920
her appearance as a little old lady.

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,880
She was not what I was expecting at all, but the thing

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,860
that I wasn't expecting most was that she was Deaf herself.

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,880
I remember thinking, like, "How is she supposed to teach us

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,360
"if she's Deaf and we can't understand her?"

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
At the time, I had no real knowledge about deafness,

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,680
and I didn't know any sign language.

00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,389
I remember, a student who arrived late for the class

00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:36,780
walked in while the teacher was writing on the whiteboard

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,920
with her back to us.

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,600
The latecomer walked in and started explaining quite loudly

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,680
how she couldn't find the room, how she got lost.

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Of course, the teacher didn't turn around,

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
and we all uttered in unison, "She's Deaf,"

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,900
to which the classmate actually started then apologizing

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,840
quite loudly to the teacher's back.

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,199
I was so Deaf unaware at the time that that late student could have been me.

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,480
I probably would have done something equally as silly, really.

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,600
People like her, I would say, aren't trying to be rude or exclusive --

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,980
or, people like me at the time aren't trying to be rude or exclusive,

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,180
we're just so used to hearing in a hearing world

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,340
that we never actually give a thought

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,400
to what we'd do if we actually met a Deaf person.

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,000
And you might be wondering how did she teach us, actually.

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,840
And I'll try and strain my brain back to remember

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,620
because it was so long ago, and she basically just

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,400
taught us by full immersion.

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,660
We sort of picked up signs.

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,560
I don't know. I don't want to say "through osmosis."

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,300
It was a bit more structured than that, but yeah.

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,040
Maybe a sign language class has to be experienced in person.

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,900
I can't begin to describe how it was.

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,060
Okay. This is some information about sign language.

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,620
Before that first enrichment class, I never really gave a thought

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,960
to what sign language might be,

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,420
but I did think it would be close to English in what it actually is.

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,920
Just like there are many spoken languages in the world,

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,820
there are also many different sign languages.

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,240
Most people -- most hearing people I tell that to are shocked.

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,260
They assume that sign language is the same all over the world

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,000
and that Deaf people from all over communicate with each other easily

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,820
using one universal sign language.

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,760
The thing is, they're at least half right.

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,040
Although spoken languages in different countries

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,580
can be markedly different, Deaf signers don't usually have

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,860
the same communication barriers

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,480
when using their native sign languages with each other.

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,200
British and American English are I'd say at least 99% the same,

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,440
proven by the fact that you're having no problem following me so far -- I hope.

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
But you'll be very surprised to hear that British

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,920
and American Sign Language is very different.

00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,800
The two languages have completely different alphabets.

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,000
The American Sign Language alphabet uses one hand,

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,440
whereas the British Sign Language alphabet uses both.

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,740
What surprises people more,

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,680
because it goes further than that, is that in BSL, there are also --

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,760
British Sign Language, by the way, BSL, -- there are also regional signs

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,920
which can be thought of a bit like regional dialects

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,300
in a spoken language.

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,840
For example, "holiday," as in a vacation,

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,040
in the north of England

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,860
is signed like this in the north, seriously,

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,860
whereas, in the south, it's signed like this.

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,180
"Holiday" -- sorry, because this is "lazy" in the north of England,

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,020
whereas in the south, this is "lazy."

00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,760
I should actually move to the side so you can perhaps see.

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,940
So "holiday," "lazy;"

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,280
in the south it's "holiday," "lazy."

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,840
I remember almost 14 years ago when I was first learning BSL

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,260
I was horrified at the thought of these regional signs

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,840
and by the thoughts of the examiners for the BSL exams

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,170
who would come from anywhere in the country

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,440
and ask me questions using their regional signs.

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
However, I soon found that these regional signs were not a barrier.

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,090
I found this because sign language isn't just understood using the signs.

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,540
It also relies heavily on body language

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,300
and facial expression, as well as lip patterns.

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,220
This meant that regional signs weren't a barrier to me.

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,740
I found I understood them instantly a lot of the time,

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,760
and even borrowed a few of them from different parts of the country.

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,400
Just as spoken language relies on nonverbal feedback from a listener,

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,580
particularly in a one-to-one conversation setting,

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,380
sign language users give feedback through facial expression and body language

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,020
to show that they're following what is being signed.

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,740
From what I've seen, this practice seems to help Deaf people

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,510
from different parts of the world communicate much more easily

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,360
than hearing people using spoken and written languages.

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
Just two weeks ago, I saw two people in London

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
communicating well with their native sign languages.

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
One person was British, using British Sign Language,

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,540
and the other was from Spain, using their own local sign language.

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,060
Okay. Since it's the final day of the conference,

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,860
I thought it would be nice to get in some last-minute networking.

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,700
So if you want to turn to the person next to you, maybe,

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,940
and ask who they are.

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,240
As you can see on the screen,

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,280
here is the British Sign Language alphabet and some questions.

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,220
So, to get the sentence structure right,

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,730
you put the topic of what you're talking about first

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,560
and put the question at the end most of the time.

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,220
So if you want to turn to the person next to you and say,

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,040
"name," "you," "what?"

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,260
And then you can reply saying "name," "me,"

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,040
and then you can find your -- how to spell your name.

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,060
(audience member) Are the hands from my perspective?

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,740
(Sarah Jessica Leivers) They're from your perspective.

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,380
But that's a good question, because the question signs

00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,480
are from the perspective of the person watching.

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,600
And then you can ask, "work," "where," "do" --

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,480
which is also the same sign as "make" -- "do," "what?"

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,100
Okay.

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,220
Okay. I also wanted to talk about diversity.

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,500
As we all know, diversity brings massive advantages to businesses

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,260
and communities, especially when trying to solve problems.

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,320
As it's been said, the best way to solve a difficult problem

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
generally is to get a diverse group of people

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,980
with diverse intellects working on it.

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,160
Computer programming is full of solving problems.

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,780
It's one of the main reasons why I and many others enjoy it.

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,080
It's finding creative solutions to technical and logical challenges.

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,260
And we all know that there are many groups of people

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,080
who are underrepresented in our industry and communities.

00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,019
One particular shame, in my opinion, when it comes to

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,420
the underrepresentation of Deaf sign languages users

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,940
in programming is that they could actually have a mind

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,880
wired to give an over-average ability

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,420
to solve logical problems, and could therefore be

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,440
an extra-valuable asset to any team or community.

00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,300
So what, you know? This is something I find fascinating.

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,600
And somebody at DCAL at UCL

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,200
in London I've been talking to,

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,380
something I've spoken to him a lot about.

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,139
So, I'm definitely not a neurologist.

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,080
So here's my understanding I have from him in layman's terms.

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,280
"Our brains have a finite number of neurons.

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,080
"They're precious, and none will be wasted.

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,459
"When someone is born deaf, those neurons that would otherwise

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,020
"have been used up in audio processing

00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,160
"will be commandeered by other parts of the brain.

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,519
"This rewiring can enable different parts of the brain

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,000
"to form connections with and speak to each other,

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,320
"these connections lacking in an average brain.

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,740
"People with parts of the brain which have connections

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,060
"not observed in others are seen as having advantages:

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,680
"potentially superior ability with visual processing,

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,960
"certain kinds of memory recall and logical problem solving --

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,900
"skills required in computer programming."

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,340
And from that passage as well as some of my references,

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,580
who you can't see on your screen, include...

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,860
...Barnaby Lamb from UCL DCAL,

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,340
and also a paper by Hamilton, 2011.

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,260
Okay. Learning resources.

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,990
It can be difficult for anyone to change career,

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,660
even though it's commonplace for people to do so nowadays.

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,380
I transitioned into this career in my mid to late 20s,

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,240
and did other things before. I've often thought about

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,980
what a Deaf sign language user might do to change career.

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,870
I use learning resources, including blog posts

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,860
and online videos to learn from.

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,340
Many of the videos, especially the paid video learning providers,

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:26,560
are captioned. However, the quality of the captions isn't always great,

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,940
and I've spotted many mistakes when captioning technical language.

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,680
And just as an aside, I've actually, since I've been at the conference,

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,860
noticed some mistakes in some of the talks as well,

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,559
which is unfortunate.

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
A couple of weeks ago when I was in London,

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,180
I called some on-site learning providers

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,620
to see if they could serve a Deaf user, just out of interest,

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,600
because I knew what the answer was probably going to be.

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,320
Only one provider of part-time courses

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,420
told me it was very likely that they would be able

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,160
to provide an interpreter free of charge.

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,440
I asked if the interpreter had experience

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,860
interpreting programming courses before

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,720
and had all the suitable technical vocabulary in sign language.

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,560
But the person I spoke to couldn't assure me of this

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,089
because they had used sign language interpreters

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,300
to interpret during various classes before,

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,680
but never a programming class.

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,420
Also, coding boot camps are a popular way

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,780
for people to change career nowadays.

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,280
I contacted a few boot camps about whether they would be able

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,980
to provide for a Deaf sign language user,

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,960
and out of the people I contacted,

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,160
only one got back to me and said that it'd be unsuitable

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
since pair programming with other students

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,620
is central to the learning experience.

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,740
In London, I know many Deaf people who pursue a variety of careers.

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,260
One Deaf friend in particular, Robert, isn't a programmer,

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,180
but he has a very technical job. He's very successful,

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,640
and he has his own bespoke furniture design and manufacturing business.

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,400
He uses computer aided design, and then programs --

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,040
cutting and 3D printing machines to produce his creations.

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,620
I asked him recently how he acquired his technical skills.

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,939
He explained to me that after leaving school,

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,600
he got an apprenticeship at a London museum

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,720
making museum displays, which is how he started,

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,350
but to get to where he is today, he's mostly self-taught

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,660
by using a problem-based learning approach,

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,200
referring to online learning resources,

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,820
and occasionally finding knowledgeable people to help

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,540
when he's particularly stuck on something.

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,360
As you're aware, I'm speaking at a Python conference.

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,780
You might wonder why that is: because Python would be a good language

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,840
for a Deaf sign language user to start coding in.

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,900
I personally think so, and this is a quote from a Deaf programmer

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:18,520
I had online contact with, and this person thinks so, too.

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,579
Another Deaf programmer I had communication with recently

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,040
suggested another reason why Python might be good

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,180
for Deaf sign language users to use while learning to program,

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,920
and that is that there are lots of visual libraries available

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,760
in Python that connect as a way into programming,

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,300
and Python could be picked up on the side.

00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,680
I recently went out for pizza with a Deaf friend in London.

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,040
The waiter at the restaurant had very poor Deaf awareness.

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,920
It was obvious to me that he was embarrassed,

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
didn't want to look at my friend as he talked,

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,920
and was all fidgety and moved around more

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,680
while he was talking than he probably would have done

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,140
with a table of hearing people.

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,640
I think this was out of embarrassment.

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,380
Unfortunately, this kind of experience,

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,800
from what my Deaf friends tell me, isn't unusual.

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,400
Why aren't more people Deaf aware?

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,340
I asked some of my hearing friends about how Deaf aware they are.

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,360
None of them had any Deaf friends,

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,540
and they knew very little about deafness and Deaf culture.

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,080
It seems that hearing people don't mean to be exclusive,

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,940
but they don't know how to be embracive of Deaf people either.

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,720
They often don't want to cause an offense or embarrassment,

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
so instead of making an effort when they see a Deaf person

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,680
at a meeting or party, they steer clear,

00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,180
and in so doing, they can actually cause the offense and embarrassment

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,540
that they are trying to avoid.

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,620
Like these gloves.

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,880
Two students at the University of Washington, I think it was,

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,710
just won the Lemelson-MIT prize for the invention of gloves

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,240
that transcribe ASL to speech.

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,320
As well-meaning as this project was, I know that Deaf people

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,500
have reacted to this invention angrily.

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,860
Trying to sort of explain the sentiment behind this,

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,260
I know I'm going to fall short with this example,

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
but I'll try and give it anyway.

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,480
It's being like me ordering a dress, say, from an online shop,

00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
only to find that I ordered a dress

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,480
that's a couple of sizes too small for me.

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,320
Then I contact the shop to organize an exchange,

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,940
only to be told, "No, madam,

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,680
"that dress is perfectly sized and fits women shaped to wear it.

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,940
"It is not a couple of sizes too small, it is that you are too fat."

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Putting this sentiment aside,

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,960
I don't see how these gloves would ever allow for a conversation,

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,320
because my obvious question is:

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,480
how is the hearing person going to reply anyway?

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,360
A while ago, I asked the leader of a local meetup that I attend

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,280
what she would do if a Deaf person turned up to a meeting one time.

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,740
She admitted that she wouldn't have a clue.

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,580
So here are some communication tips

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,900
for meetups, and...

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,120
...basically generally any time you might meet a Deaf person.

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,960
I'm going to do what I don't like doing, which is reading from slides.

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,340
Make sure you have the person's attention before you start speaking.

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,440
Try to use a place with good lighting

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,300
so the person can see your face clearly.

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,480
Face the person and speak clearly,

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,340
using plain language in a normal way.

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,440
Do not exaggerate your lip patterns.

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,900
This is extremely unhelpful for someone trying to lip read.

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,320
However, that is something that a lot of hearing people do,

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,160
genuinely thinking they're being helpful.

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Check whether the person has understood.

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,860
If they haven't, try explaining a different way,

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,040
just as you would do normally.

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,860
If you can't sign, you can use gestures

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,440
to accompany what you say,

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,040
many of which we actually use when communicating with hearing people,

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,100
such as "please take a seat," or "would you like a drink?"

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Do not shout. Just as when you shout

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,060
at a hearing person, it's aggressive.

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,640
If the person is a hearing aid user, then it can also be uncomfortable.

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
The most important thing is to make an effort.

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,420
Remember that Deaf people are the experts

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
when communicating with you.

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,440
There are always many tactics to try when an interpreter isn't available.

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,500
Some tips particularly for meetups and conferences and such.

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,120
If possible, have both sign language interpretation

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,200
and closed captioning at conferences and meetups, too.

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,360
After each talk, attendees usually gather for tea and snacks,

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,420
and also socialize and discuss the presentation they've just heard.

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,720
It can be difficult for a Deaf person to participate

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,640
in these conversations with hearing peers.

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,540
Organizers should cultivate awareness to ask speakers,

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,480
experts, open source contributors to spend time

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,760
talking to Deaf attendees during these times.

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,580
At meetups where there are practical sessions,

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,980
organizers should enable mentors to sit with Deaf participants.

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,200
Remember that mentors don't have to be organizers or speakers,

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,460
that they should be someone matched appropriately

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,020
depending on the skills of the participant.

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,040
If possible, share slides and notes with Deaf attendees

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,380
prior to the talks to make it easier to follow what is being said.

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,220
Deaf people who are in attendance at conferences and meetups

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
is currently low.

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,920
People can be proactive by inviting Deaf persons to talk

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,900
and give talks to a Deaf user audience,

00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,280
perhaps as a Birds of a Feather talk.

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,500
And these are actually --

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,640
those were actually tips I was actually given

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,200
by Deaf people who are programmers.

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I found this quote online.

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
It was actually within an article about those gloves

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,040
that I showed you earlier, and I just think it's extremely sad.

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,500
This is Alex Lu. He says that "hearing people reject the idea

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,580
"that signed languages are valid and complex.

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,840
"When we gesture, they refuse to try to understand us.

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,460
"When we whip out the pen and paper, they complain it takes too long.

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,860
"They shoot down each and every vehicle we send in trying to get a message across

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,400
"with some flimsy excuse to cover their insecurity.

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,000
"But their one and only preferred option is a non-negotiable for us.

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,940
"Eventually, we run out of options, or more likely, they run out of patience.

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,020
"We go and find an interpreter. Or we just give up."

00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,660
I think that's quite sad, so should we, like, not be that kind of person?

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,640
Lastly, I just wanted to close on -- this is not a tick box exercise.

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,200
It should be approached with the right heart.

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,220
And this is a quote by a Deaf Pythonista

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,860
I've had the privilege of contact with, Ian Smith,

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,440
and I really like how he sums this up really well.

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,340
I was just also asked by someone who I got to read my talk for me.

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,160
He actually asked something I'd overlooked.

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,820
"Say if I do want to learn to sign, if I want to take the next step

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,320
"and learn some sign language for myself, what should I do?"

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,820
And this took me back a moment because me starting was so long ago.

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,020
And after some thought, I think the best way to start off

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,600
would be by looking on Youtube.

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,760
There are plenty of instructory tutorials available on there

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,600
in all the different sign languages. I recently followed one in ASL,

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,580
because I didn't know any -- I still don't know any --

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,700
and I noticed that from the instructory video I saw,

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,200
some of the question signs are different.

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,760
I think what is "what" in British might be "where" in American.

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm not sure. I can't remember. See, I don't know.

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,240
Also, I'd recommend finding what courses are in your area

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,480
if you'd actually like to go and attend a course in person.

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,160
I think Google is going to be your best bet for this.

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,480
Sadly, where I learnt to sign now only teaches Makaton.

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,200
They've really cut back on the sign language courses that they offer.

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,300
So, yes, I think that's everything I need --

00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,520
well, everything I'd like to share right now. I'll be around after

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,660
if anyone wants to come and talk to me. Be cool.

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,780
[applause]

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,520
(session chair) Thank you very much.

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,680
And this is last session, so thank you for being here at Pycon,

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,360
and thank you again to Sarah for this great talk.

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
So I think we'll be moving down to the main hall now.

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Let's thank Sarah again.

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,440
