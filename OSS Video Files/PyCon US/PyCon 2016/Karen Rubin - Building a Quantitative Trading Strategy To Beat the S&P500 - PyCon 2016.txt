Title: Karen Rubin - Building a Quantitative Trading Strategy To Beat the S&P500 - PyCon 2016
Publication date: 2016-05-30
Playlist: PyCon 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Karen Rubin

Two years ago, Karen embarked on a project to learn how to research, write and trade algorithms to invest in the market. She re-learned python and explored what would happen if you invested in women-led companies over a 12-year period. In this talk, she will walk through the highs and lows of her journey from initial data gathering, through writing a strategy to validation and trading.

(moderator) I'm happy to introduce Karen Rubin.

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,880
She's going to talk about algorithmic trading.

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,100
Please give a hand for Karen.

00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:13,740
[applause]

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,660
(Karen Rubin) Thank you.

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,540
Thank you very much.

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,100
So I’m here today to talk about

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,340
building a quantitative trading strategy,

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,199
but more than that I’m here to tell you a story

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,760
about the first trading strategy I wrote and about the mistakes

00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,169
and the journey that I've been on for the last year and a half.

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:34,030
Hopefully it'll make it easier for everybody here

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,290
who wants to get started doing the same.

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,260
Before I dive into that, I have to tell you

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,270
I am not providing investment advice.

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,330
Do not listen to me for investment advice.

00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,079
Nothing I say should be construed as investment advice.

00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,160
I’m the VP of Product at a company called Quantopian.

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,560
Quantopian has a platform that lets people write, trade,

00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,940
research, and test strategies to invest in the market.

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,670
We have a community of just under 80,000 users

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,340
who are doing this all the time.

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,750
They work together, they work individually.

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,050
All of the code that they write to invest in the markets is their own,

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,330
and then we identify the best strategies

00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,820
and make allocations to those strategies,

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,800
and the algo author gets a percent of the profit.

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,680
I started at Quantopian --

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,660
uh, they don't get a percent of the profit.

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,720
They get a weight -- they get ten percent of the profit.

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm allowed to say that I think.

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,800
[laughter]

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,940
In any case, I started at Quantopian almost two years ago

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,729
and I’m a product manager.

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,240
What that means for me is I have a degree in computer science,

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,479
but I've never traded -- I've never written code professionally.

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,080
I've been in product to the point I started at Quantopian for 10 years.

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,530
I build marketing software, I build social media software.

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,320
I've built commerce software and content production software.

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,520
But I have never worked in the world

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,960
of building financial trading platforms.

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,740
I've never traded a strategy.

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,670
I've never worked with quants.

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,729
So I came into this job having to work with my engineers

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:02,460
to build a platform to do something I've never done.

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,220
And so as a product manager, one of the first things

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,240
I needed to do was write a strategy to invest in the market

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,669
so that I could understand what my users were doing,

00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,859
and how they were going to use the platform,

00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:17,049
and what their workflow was, and what their challenges were.

00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,209
And so I took a deep breath and I spent a bunch of time

00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,549
trying to figure out what I was gonna do.

00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,430
What strategy would I write to invest in the market?

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,210
What would my thesis be?

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,080
And it actually took me a couple of months

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,940
to figure out what that should be.

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,540
So this is the journey of figuring that out

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,420
and writing this strategy.

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,999
As a product manager, I do a lot of research in my users,

00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,370
and the research that I do informs the product that we build

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,180
but then also the product that we build,

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,640
in this particular instance, was also able to inform

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,810
the strategy that I created.

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,699
It's been a really interesting back-and-forth cycle

00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,899
of a year and a half.

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,720
And in some ways I consider this strategy

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,060
the gift that keeps on giving

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,099
because every time we build something new, I have this epiphany.

00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm like, "Oh my God, that works for my strategy!"

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,519
And then we are building something for the product and I'm like,

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,370
"I know why that's painful for the user!"

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,059
So it's been a lot of fun to just understand who my users are

00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,479
and get back to writing code

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,839
and building a strategy to invest in the market.

00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:16,239
So the first thing I had to do was figure out what it was going to be.

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,680
And I spent a bunch of time thinking about different things,

00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,020
and then Credit Squeeze came out with their Gender 3000 report.

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,960
And this was in late 2013,

00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,569
and the Gender 3000 report took a look at 3000 companies

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,189
across 40 countries, and it looked at how gender

00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,790
was reflected in those organizations.

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,329
As of 2013, women were 12.9% of top management,

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,719
and they were on 12.7% of boards.

00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,230
Now, I don't think -- These numbers are abysmal,

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,290
but they're probably not surprising.

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,829
We all know that this is a problem.

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,059
And the numbers, the charts that I liked a little bit more

00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:52,319
was this which shows the global performance of companies.

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,299
The gray line is companies with one or more women on their board.

00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,389
And the blue line is companies with no women on their board.

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,009
That's interesting.

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,560
This is performance again tiered

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,359
by percentage of the management team that's female.

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,159
So the purple line at the top is 50% women, gray is 33,

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,999
blue is 25, and yellow is all companies.

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,980
So these two charts got me to be asking the question,

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,180
what if you invested in female CEOs?

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,560
I wanted a strategy that was simple to implement.

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,130
I wasn't going to be doing deep statistical analysis

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,900
to try to look at market movements

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,500
or momentum strategies, and I thought I could do something

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,750
where when a female CEO came in to the position of CEO,

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,419
I bought a stock,

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,110
and when she left the position, I sold.

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,310
Super simple strategy.

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,229
[laughter]

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:44,020
Right back to coding for the first time in 10 years,

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,550
I thought even I could figure this one out.

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,470
Now our platform has a couple of online tools

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,630
and it gives a lot of data to our users.

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,150
It has pricing data,

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,920
historical pricing data, back to 2002.

00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,820
I'll explain in a minute why that matters.

00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,699
Then it also has fundamental data,

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,939
which is everything that a company reports

00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,870
on their 10-K or their 10-Q.

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,139
Those are their annual and quarterly reports,

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,080
and it's 600 data points per company per quarter.

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,610
None of those are gender

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,710
of the CEO or anybody else in the organization.

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,319
So the first thing I needed was to get some companies

00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,310
that had female CEOs and understand what they were.

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,580
It was important that I had that historically.

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,780
If I took a look today at the female CEOs

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:27,199
and just looked back at how those companies had performed,

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,930
it wouldn't necessarily reflect the performance of the CEOs in position.

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,030
I wanted to invest in companies when they actually had a female CEO.

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,030
So I went to every researcher’s trusted research partner, Google,

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,719
and googled "historical female CEO lists" and actually found a non-profit, Catalyst,

00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,400
that is focused on putting women into --

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,500
helping women in positions of business.

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,479
They have a historical report they put out every year.

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,199
It's "The Bottom Line Report."

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,460
It identifies all of the CEOs in the Fortune 1000 that are women,

00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:02,830
and it goes back 10 or 20 years.

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,629
So every single year they look at all the companies in the Fortune 1000,

00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,040
and they say, "Who are the female CEOs?"

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,720
I reached out to them and asked them if they would share it with me,

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,550
and they were very willing to and they sent me a PDF.

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,039
So I manually copied from the PDF into my spreadsheet

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,020
all of the female CEOs from 12 years

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,780
and what company they worked at.

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,440
That's the first two columns that you can see over here.

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,020
Then what I actually needed was the ticker symbol of those companies

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,439
and the CEO's start and end date

00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,979
because my strategy was buy when they started,

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,639
sell when they ended.

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,749
So I manually went through all the CEOs

00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,540
and googled for all of this information.

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,400
I began actually using Mechanical Turk

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,340
and I sent it out and I got two other people

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,770
to verify every single one of these data points

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,780
to understand if I had the data correct.

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,090
At the end of doing all of this, I had 80 female CEOs in 74 companies.

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,520
So from the period of 2002 to the end of 2014,

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,120
there were 80 female CEOs in the Fortune 1000.

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
That was across 74 companies because some companies

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,669
have multiple female CEOs.

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,660
And so now that I had this data,

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,460
I pulled it into our research platform, which is a hosted IPython platform.

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,529
I did a lot of this work in our research platform

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,280
entirely because it was the platform we were building at the time.

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,780
I’m a product manager.

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,920
I was trying to understand how to make it better,

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,210
and so I did a lot of work within that,

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,840
and learned how to use IPython and Jupyter,

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,449
and understood what I was doing from there.

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,370
This chart shows the number of new CEOs every single year.

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,240
You'll see, I would argue, that this trend is going

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,539
in the right direction: up and to the right.

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,699
You might also notice -- although the font might be too small --

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,499
this goes back to before 2002.

00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,889
Dates are really important in this, and I'll explain why in a minute.

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,590
My simulation that I’m going to run starts at the beginning of 2002

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,039
and goes to the end of 2014,

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,419
but I have the female CEOs that were CEOs in 2002.

00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,300
So they might have started prior to that,

00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,560
but on the first day of my simulation,

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,830
they were CEOs, and I buy those companies as well.

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,710
So these are the 80 females that we were looking at.

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,599
To take a step back and explain what my simulation is,

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,799
what I'm running here is called a backtest.

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,900
It's a historical simulation that looks back in history

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,600
and says "If I were trading this strategy on the market,

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,480
what would the performance have been?"

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,260
And it actually marches on through history

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,100
making buy and sell decisions

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,460
as if it were actually trading in the market.

00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:29,680
That's why it's important that there's data back to 2002

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,120
at the minute level for every security that traded

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,190
on the US equity market for those 12 years.

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,300
What my first pass at this strategy, the most basic version that I ran, did

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,320
is every single day, starting from January 2, 2002,

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,380
which is the first trading day of 2002, it asks a couple questions.

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,070
It says first, "Are there any CEOs that started today?"

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,329
If the answer is yes, it buys 500 shares of that company.

00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,800
And then it says, "Did any CEOs end today?"

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,000
If it says yes, it sells everything that I had for that company.

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,090
It then moves on to the next day.

00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,920
My strategy marches on through history

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,649
making buy and sell decisions using historical data

00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,529
as if it were actually trading in the market during that time period.

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,640
This is a look at how many positions I hold

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,460
at any point during my strategy.

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,860
You'll notice that at the beginning in 2002 during that year

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,070
I hold about eight different companies.

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,151
By the end of my strategy, I hold 40 to 50.

00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:25,199
So the number of female CEOs that are actually working

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,850
in the Fortune 1000 grows over time,

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,850
and my portfolio gets larger.

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,260
This is the meat of the code of the algorithm,

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,330
this very first pass that I did.

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,650
The first thing it does is it gets today's date.

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,110
Now that's not today's date, that's the date in my strategy,

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,199
so the date of the simulation.

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,990
It then goes back to that CEO list that I showed you,

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,490
and it identifies:

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,280
Were there any CEOs that started today?

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,780
Were there any CEOs that ended today?

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,740
And it iterates through two loops.

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,940
This first loop is just basically buying everything.

00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,889
So it goes through that start list,

00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,100
it identifies the companies that are there,

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,890
and then it orders target right here.

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,399
What that does is it basically says, "Get me into a position

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,610
"of 500 shares in this company."

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,100
Then that function basically takes care of making that happen.

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,880
The next for loop here is basically ending today,

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,300
and so it goes through that list, does the same thing,

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,400
and it sends an order target for zero.

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,089
So it says no matter what I owned, get me to zero, get me out.

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,839
This is the meat of my strategy.

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,819
Now before I actually got to this point,

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,600
there are a couple of things I had to do.

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,500
I wrote this strategy up.

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,339
Even for somebody who had not done any coding

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,860
in 10 years, this was code I could understand.

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,420
This was basically pretty simple,

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,529
couple of for loops, some pandas which I had to learn.

00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:43,420
The first couple times I ran this -- the first couple times?

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,339
The first tens of times I ran this, it just crashed and I kept getting errors.

00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,139
It turns out there's a couple of interesting things

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,200
about dates and trading strategies.

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,790
I had gone to Google and I had gotten the start and end date

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,949
for all of these CEOs.

00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,400
Something that's different about a CEO of a Fortune 1000 company

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,839
from you or I is they don't start their job

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,050
two weeks after quitting their last job on the next Monday.

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,680
They start on the first of the month,

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,880
or the first of the quarter, or the first of the year.

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,040
It doesn't matter if that day is a weekend or a holiday.

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,700
It doesn't matter if they actually go to work on that day.

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,660
It doesn't matter if it's a trading day,

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,400
and so I kept running into these situations

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,220
where I was trying to buy and sell things on days

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,020
that didn't exist, and I was not buying and selling

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,240
what I thought I was going to buy.

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,000
Then I realized I had to do some work

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,460
to cleanse these dates

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,220
to make sure that I was looking for the nearest trading date of all the CEOs.

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,460
The other spectacular thing about working in the world of finance

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,180
that I don't think I knew before I started this

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,779
is ticker symbols aren't unique.

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,299
They're reused because that makes sense!

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,740
[laughter]

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,120
So the best example of this is actually TWTR.

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,620
If you go buy TWTR today,

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,600
you're going to get a share of Twitter right?

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,740
But if, back in the late 90s or early 2000s, you buy TWTR,

00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,340
you're going to get a share of Tweeter Home Entertainment.

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,680
And if you are a child of the 90s like I am,

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,279
you know that that was a stereo system company.

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,559
So you do not want TWTR that was sold back then,

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,000
you want what's now.

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,751
So in any case you have to match the date of the CEO to the symbol

00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:13,830
to get what's called a security identifier,

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,020
which is the unique thing.

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,380
After doing -- I think, in the early part of this,

00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,230
I probably spent 30% of my time just cleansing the data,

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,020
something all researchers probably understand,

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,139
and that was the gender dates, just making sure it was clean

00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,470
and it was actually what I wanted to do.

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,040
So I’m at work Sunday.

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,560
I've probably -- looking back it feels like it was weeks and weeks

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,279
trying to just get to the first point where I could run this backtest

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,719
and get my first version.

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,260
I've got the data clean.

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,900
I've got everything working, and I press go on my backtest,

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,720
and it actually runs, and I don't get an error,

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,459
and this is what my return chart looks like.

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,069
This is my strategy,

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,780
investing in 500 shares of the Fortune 1000 female CEOs.

00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,540
It was probably about eight o'clock at night.

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,000
Put yourself in my position.

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,240
You've all been there.

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,019
You're working on writing some code, it has not been working,

00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,130
you're frustrated, and it finally runs.

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,000
I mic dropped, I walked out of the office,

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,840
I went home, patted myself on the back,

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,360
and thought I was a rock star.

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,140
My strategy went up and to the right.

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,520
I work in startups.

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,360
Up and to the right is always good.

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,010
[laughter]

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,899
It wasn't until about three o'clock in the morning that I realized

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,970
I don't actually know what this means.

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,430
Does it beat the market?

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,740
Is this good?

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,060
Great, it went up and to the right, but this isn't telling me anything.

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,079
So the next day I come back to work

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,059
and I get some help putting it against a benchmark.

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,840
This is the strategy -- the first strategy

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,320
of the Fortune 1000 female CEOs as compared to the S&P 500.

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,940
In this particular scenario it outperforms by 389%.

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,350
Now that sounds awesome,

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,770
but how many of you write bug-free code on the first shot?

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,320
Yeah, I thought there might be a few of you!

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:51,110
I don't do that very often, and so what I did was --

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,660
and being the fact that I'd never done this before,

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,220
I went to our in-house quant,

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,360
the guy that has actually written strategies to invest in the market before,

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,200
and I said, "Justin, am I amazing?

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,560
"Should I quit my job?

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,740
"Tell me what's going on here."

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,300
And he said, "Karen what's your leverage?"

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,120
And I said, "My what?"

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,440
[laughter]

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
Now, leverage is a wonderful little thing.

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,199
When you're trading with a brokerage, you can lever up your portfolio.

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,430
What that means is they'll lend you money to increase your buying power.

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,110
So say you have $1000, you can lever up six times,

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,350
and now you've got $6000.

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,860
You pay interest on the money you borrow,

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,089
but in theory, if you're really good at what you do,

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,160
you're going to make more money because you've invested more money.

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,860
So Justin helped me figure out how to look at my leverage,

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,720
and this is what my leverage chart looked like.

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,760
You might not be able to see those very small numbers,

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,590
but basically what's happening here is my strategy is plugging on through history,

00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:52,670
it hits 2008, I borrow 200 times my portfolio, I lose 400 times my portfolio.

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,040
I borrow 800 times my portfolio, I lose 600 times my portfolio.

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,020
This would never happen in reality.

00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,440
No brokerage would lend you 800 times your portfolio

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,430
and especially after you had lost a lot of money already.

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,509
So I had to go back and rethink my strategy.

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,940
What he talked to me about was rebalancing your portfolio

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,100
and not buying 500 shares of every company,

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,240
because 500 shares in, you know, Berkshire Hathaway

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,900
is not the same as 500 shares in a penny stock like Joe's Jeans.

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,880
So the new strategy goes on through history,

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,629
starts at the very beginning,

00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:31,060
looks to see if any female CEO start and it buys -- I’m sorry,

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,830
it doesn't buy -- puts them on a buy list,

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,160
gets any female CEOs that end on that day,

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,500
and it puts them on a sell list.

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,720
It then rebalances my portfolio, and in order to do this,

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,319
it takes a look at how many companies am I holding at this point.

00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,930
It takes a look at what my portfolio value is.

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,050
It divides the value by the number of companies

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,610
in my portfolio, and then it invests the same value per company.

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,490
So if I have $1000 and ten companies, I’m going to invest $100 in each company.

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,360
And then it marches on through history doing the same strategy every day,

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,910
and every time I invest in another company, it rebalances my portfolio.

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,850
So as the number of companies I’m investing in grows,

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,540
the percentage of my portfolio that each company represents diminishes.

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,320
So here's the way that that code looks,

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,150
and, again, I've got my buy/sell lists at the top.

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,980
I make sure there's something to do today,

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,400
so this is: do I have anything in my stocks to order today

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,579
or in my stock to sell today?

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,400
Here's the important thing on this one:

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,980
I sell first, so this loop is my sell loop,

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,060
and I've moved that up at the front.

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,319
So I sell out of the things I want to get out of,

00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,750
and then I recalculate my current stocks to be:

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,580
what are the companies that I want to get into?

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,180
What's left in my portfolio?

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,550
And that current stocks counter gives me the number of positions

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,579
that I've got in my portfolio at this point.

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,660
The last for loop here is getting me into the companies and rebalancing.

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,690
So what I do here is you'll see the logic right here

00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,230
where it says "calculate the value to buy".

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,069
I get my portfolio value, I've identified the number of stocks.

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,730
My value to buy is the portfolio value over the number of stocks.

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,710
Then I do order target value right here, which is basically

00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,910
whatever the stock is and the value to buy.

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,930
What this function does is it makes sure if I already own

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,180
some proportion of a company, and I need to get more,

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,780
it just gets me a little bit more,

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,580
and if I need to get less, it just gets me a little bit less.

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,010
So as opposed to selling everything and then buying it all again,

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,120
it just rebalances to make sure I have the right value.

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,770
So when I run this version of my strategy,

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,250
here's what it looks like against the S&P 500.

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,560
My algorithm investing in the female CEOs of the Fortune 1000

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,290
returns 339% for an outperformance of 217% over the S&P 500.

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,090
So being a novice quant, I'm still pretty happy with these returns.

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,320
I would take 200% returns in the market.

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,860
I’m not sure about you, but that would be great.

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,360
But I also, like, I don't know what I don't know.

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,500
So I went to the community at this point,

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,940
and I published these results to share and get some feedback.

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,880
As you can imagine, there was some response.

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,440
[laughter]

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,460
It ended up in Hacker News, and Fortune wrote about it,

00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,400
and I got tons of great feedback.

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,580
I presented it at a bunch of algorithmic trading meetups

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,120
and talked with real quants that have done this before

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,000
and got their questions and got their feedback

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
and worked to incorporate it.

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,930
It's been the best learning process I've gone through

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,350
to understand what these people actually do --

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,890
these people, my users -- what a quant does.

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,270
Oh, I should back up.

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,260
Leverage here, we should reevaluate leverage again.

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,020
This is my leverage of this strategy.

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,860
You will see it hovers around one.

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,620
That basically means I'm not borrowing anything.

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,270
So I shared this with the community and got their feedback,

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,010
and I want to now talk through some of the questions I got.

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,450
I will tell you straight off the bat, people were unbelievably helpful,

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,640
and just great in giving me support on this,

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,500
and asking really reasonable questions,

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,200
and it's helped me further everything I've done.

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
The first thing and -- interesting --

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,240
remember this is in 2015 I’m doing this.

00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,440
It's not today.

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,200
However I continue to get this question.

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,460
"Um, could it be Yahoo and Alibaba?

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,820
"Is this just Yahoo?"

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,200
The reason this is a good question is here's a look at Yahoo's stock price

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,960
during the 12-year scenario that I'm looking at.

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,510
They have had two female CEOs: Carol Bartz.

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,250
The blue arrows here represent when a female CEO leaves the position

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,410
and enters the position.

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,120
Carol leaves it here and then Marissa.

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,340
I'm sorry, Carol starts here, leaves here.

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,940
Marissa starts there.

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,810
So you could look at this and be like,

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,520
"Well, Marissa clearly is an exceptional CEO.

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,130
"The stock price of Yahoo has done nothing but go up and up and up

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,540
since she started."

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm not going to make any comments on that,

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,600
but if you know anything about Yahoo,

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,160
what actually happened here is Yahoo had made early on

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,090
a little investment in a company called Alibaba.

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,550
Alibaba IPO'd here.

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,500
Alibaba had a spectacular IPO.

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,080
So as Alibaba's stock price went up and up and up,

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,500
Yahoo's did the same thing

00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,440
because everybody knew Yahoo had this big stake in Alibaba.

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,580
The theory here is my strategy does very well during these times

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,840
when Yahoo is doing well.

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,620
Obviously, I own Yahoo.

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,350
Maybe it's just the fact that Yahoo is doing really well.

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,410
The beautiful thing is removing Yahoo from my strategy

00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,870
takes two lines of code.

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,560
I remove Yahoo from the initial CEO dataframe I’m doing,

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,400
and my strategy now returns 320%.

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,450
So the strategy goes down with Yahoo.

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,550
Yahoo has a positive impact on the overall returns here,

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,950
but it's not the entire reason for the overall returns.

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,330
The reason comes back to this chart.

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:38,080
Remember this chart is how much -- how many companies I’m holding each year.

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,810
When I'm holding Yahoo, and it's dealing with Alibaba,

00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,930
it's over here where I've got 40 or 50 companies.

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,330
So it's 1/40th of my portfolio.

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,260
It doesn't -- it's not the entire strategy.

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,540
So the next thing that people brought up that was also great

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,020
was what about sector bias?

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,420
The idea here is that you could have all of your companies in one sector.

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,530
That sector does very well for reasons that are not because

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,720
they have female CEOs or anything else,

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,550
and really what you're just investing in

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,160
is an outperformance of that one sector.

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,930
So I took the Morningstar fundamental sector codes

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,200
for all of these companies,

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,600
and this is a chart plotting those very sector codes

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,030
and the number of companies in my 80 -- in my 74 companies by sector.

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,480
You'll notice there is one outlier.

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,740
In fact 30% of my companies that have female CEOs

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,930
are in the consumer sector.

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,650
So during this 12-year period,

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,060
did the consumer sector do fabulously well

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,460
and my portfolio just returns really well because of the consumer sector?

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,270
So this gets a little more complicated.

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,910
What I need to do is create a sector-neutral strategy.

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,300
In the second version of my portfolio,

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,030
what we did was we made it so that we invested the same amount

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,220
in each company that was in my portfolio.

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,080
Now what we want to do is make sure we invest

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,420
the same amount in each sector.

00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,140
So what I do here is I get my list of CEOs

00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,050
and identify how many sectors am I going to be invested in

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,820
at any given point -- at this given point in my strategy.

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,010
I then identify again my portfolio value here

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,560
and I get the value per sector, which is just the portfolio value

00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,370
divided by the sector -- the number of sectors.

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,480
I then identify for every sector that I’m currently invested in,

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,770
how many companies are in that sector?

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,160
When I do my buy logic now --

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,580
I've just clipped out the part where I'm doing this rebalancing

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,850
I've already sold out of everything that I want to sell out of on this day.

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:30,080
When I do my buy logic, I basically say, "Get the company's current sector

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,560
"identify how many companies are in that sector,

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,470
"and then my value to buy is the value per sector

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,460
"over the number of companies in the sector."

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,090
So if you will, say we've got a strategy --

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,300
at this point my strategy I am in two different sectors.

00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,930
One of them has three companies and one of them has ten companies.

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,500
They would each get 50% of my portfolio allocated to the sector,

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,521
but the companies where there were only three companies in the sector

00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:57,180
each get one third of what's allocated to that sector.

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,590
And the companies in the sector that has 10 each get 1/10th,

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,550
so the companies will have different amounts invested,

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,750
although every sector will have the same amount,

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,150
which should neutralize any outperformance in any given sector.

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,460
So when we take a look at this strategy,

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,320
my algorithm outperforms the S&P 500 still by 153%.

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,890
So the consumer sector did actually perform very well

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,650
during this time period.

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,080
The female -- 30% of my companies were in the consumer sector,

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,980
and so you see that reflected here.

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,770
But again, it's not a slam dunk that that's the only reason

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,600
why my strategy does quite well.

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,420
So you can see that what I’m doing here

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,320
is I’m trying to systematically go through

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,900
all of the objections people give me to essentially disprove my own strategy.

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,400
I've got this theory.

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,540
I think if you invest in female CEOs

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,340
something interesting is going to happen.

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,860
But before I put any money into it, I want to make sure I'm right.

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,380
Then the next question that I got a lot

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,140
is that the S&P 500 is the wrong benchmark.

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,300
So the S&P 500 is the SPY; those are the same things.

00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,370
It's considered to be one of the best representations

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,930
of the US stock market at any given point in time.

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,400
The S&P 500, in order to --

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,770
Every year they evaluate all the companies in the market

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,030
and they use, I don't know, 10 or 12 different numbers,

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,390
and then a roomful of people decide which companies get in

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,990
and then which companies get out.

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,280
They then stack rank them by market cap

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,200
and put -- the biggest, largest portion of the index is in the biggest company,

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,480
smallest portion of the index is in the smallest company.

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,810
So it's a market cap-weighted index,

00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:31,240
which basically means large companies account for a greater portion of the index.

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,310
My strategy is an equal-weighted strategy,

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,940
so they're not exactly apples to apples.

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,360
So the theory here is that I'm just not comparing it

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,920
to something that's equivalent

00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,740
because big companies just have more weight in the S&P 500.

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,100
I could go and create, like we did with the sector one,

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,060
a market-neutral, market cap-neutral, market cap-weighted version

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,910
of my portfolio, but instead I went and I found RSP,

00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,170
which is an equal-weighted S&P 500 ETF.

00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,920
Guggenheim basically gets the list

00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,710
of all the companies in the S&P 500 every year,

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,890
and it creates an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500,

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,270
and that's what I’m doing here, so the green line is my algorithm.

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,990
The red line is the RSP.

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,240
The blue line is the S&P 500.

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,660
RSP is much more, it's much closer to my strategy.

00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,100
This is a better benchmark.

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,040
You'll also notice the RSP doesn't actually start trading until 2004,

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,070
hence the flat line here at the beginning.

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,160
So it wasn't around for the entire time of my strategy.

00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,470
But from this point forward, I actually started using the RSP

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,260
as my benchmark because it made sense to me

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,160
that this was a better benchmark.

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,800
A lot of people did say, "Well, Karen, you're sort of saying

00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,170
"the female CEOs of Fortune 1000 are a better investment

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,180
"than the rest of the Fortune 1000.

00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,840
"Wouldn't the better investment be the rest of the Fortune 1000?"

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,310
Which is a very good question.

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,340
Unfortunately Fortune sells their Fortune 1000 lists

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,800
for lots and lots and lots of money,

00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,880
and I have not been able to afford getting that, but I spent a lot of time

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,720
trying to figure out how to replicate that,

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,660
and we'll come back to that in a few minutes.

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,690
The other piece of feedback that I got a from a lot of this

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,070
is that my sample size is too small; there aren't enough female CEOs.

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,600
Yes, I agree.

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,680
[laughter]

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,500
For much of the time period that I have been working on this,

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,380
that was the feedback that I gave to people.

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,560
You're right, there aren't; let's change that.

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,250
But what has also happened is I went about trying to find

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,160
a bigger data set.

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,440
What I found from Catalyst was just the Fortune 1000 female CEOs

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,380
but obviously, well, it's only a portion of the market.

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,190
On any given day, there are about 8,000 securities trading

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,700
on the US equity market,

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,720
and I’m only looking at a portion, one eighth of those.

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,320
So what if I looked at the broader market?

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,090
This is one of those examples where our product was continuing

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,860
to evolve, things were continuing to happen,

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,900
and then I had various aha moments when I realized

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,210
that I could do one more thing.

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,200
We created a data marketplace.

00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,580
So we have Morningstar fundamentals data and pricing data,

00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,340
and then somebody else in my company

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,440
was working on integrating all this other data,

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,640
and at some point I realized that he had CEO changes from EventVestor.

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,080
I went to him and I, I might have been a little bit excited.

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,160
I think I jumped up and down and I shook him and I was like,

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,800
"Does this have gender?"

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,600
And he actually to go back and ask them

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,400
because gender wasn't one of the columns

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
that they normally provided, but they do have gender.

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,320
So this data set's a really interesting data set.

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,240
It has -- from 2007 to today, it has over 4,000 CEO change events,

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,710
which means they identify when a CEO changes in an organization,

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,880
they give you information like, is it an interim change?

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,020
Is it a permanent change?

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,240
Were they hired from within?

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
Were they hired from without?

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,500
And what is their gender as well as their name?

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,160
So over the time period, I have 175 incoming female CEOs,

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,990
and 97 outgoing female CEOs,

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,850
so it is a much larger pool to draw from.

00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,470
Now, one of the nice things here is all the data is --

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,530
Remember I talked about how I had to do all that data cleansing

00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,690
for my data that I scraped off the internet?

00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,420
It was all taken care of for me here.

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,300
It was all mapped, it was all the correct dates,

00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,060
it was much much lovelier, much nicer to work with.

00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,540
So I took that, and it also was nice because

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,320
it was kind of coming together of two things.

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,890
This was a pipeline API that I got to work on

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,710
with one of our engineers, which allows you to evaluate

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,650
all 8000 stocks on any given day against all the data we've got.

00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,830
So all I had to do to incorporate this into --

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,300
I basically wrote a new strategy.

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,500
I didn't incorporate it into my same female CEO strategy.

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,030
I started over with the same premise -- was I basically identified

00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,111
that I want the in CEO gender, so what's the CEO gender of coming in

00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,391
to start in the position?

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,860
And I want to know the effective date.

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,710
They give you two dates.

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,320
There's the date you learn about this and can trade on the information,

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,650
and then there's also the date that it actually becomes effective.

00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,950
I thought the effective date was more apples to apples

00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,060
with my female Fortune 1000 strategy, so I was using that.

00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,010
Then I set a screen term of anything where the gender is ambiguous

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,410
and they don't know what it is.

00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,870
I just sort of ignore all of those for my strategy.

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,360
My ordering logic -- this is actually to get

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,210
my stocks to order today list and my stocks to close today lists.

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,080
The one interesting thing I have to do here is

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,120
we -- to deal with that effective date,

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,450
which can again be on a Saturday or a Sunday or a non-trading day --

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,570
I took a time delta of seven days.

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,500
And I -- seven is a pretty arbitrary number.

00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,390
I just said a week sounds rational.

00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,320
That will get me around any major events,

00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,730
and just through testing, it looked like it worked pretty well.

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,120
So my CEOs of starting today are anybody where today's events,

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,940
which are events that happened in the last seven days

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,340
and have an end sender of conduct.gender which in this case is set to female.

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,330
I then get my portfolio and I say,

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,140
"Were there any events that happened today

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,760
"that were for companies in my portfolio?"

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,110
And that's important because if one of the companies

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,600
is going from a female CEO to a female CEO,

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,320
I don't need to exit.

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,680
But if it goes from a female to a male CEO, I did want to sell.

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,470
So I get my list of CEOs ending today by removing those,

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,230
and then I get my two lists of CEOs ordering today and CEOs closing today.

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,120
And from there, the actual ordering logic is exactly the same.

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,650
I sell everything, I figure out how many companies I want to hold,

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,910
and then I buy it in a balanced way.

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,420
I go back to just a market -- an equal-weighted strategy here,

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,020
so it's not the sector version I showed last.

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,380
It's just looking at all the companies.

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,740
When I do that, here's -- the blue line is my new algorithm

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,710
using the EventVestor set; that's the blue line.

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,261
The green line is the Fortune 1000 strategy

00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,680
over the same time period.

00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,390
The red is the RSP.

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,070
Now the time on this changes.

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,990
The EventVestor data starts in 2007, so that's why you'll notice

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,760
that there's a big difference in the returns

00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,700
from my Fortune 1000 strategy to this.

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,740
I had to rerun that with just the limited data

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,830
to be able to have a benchmark.

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,860
There's also some interesting things here you'll notice,

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,380
like what is going on here?

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,880
There's a big up and a big down.

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,590
My first thought was something must be wrong with the data.

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,610
Turns out, there's one big difference between this EventVestor data set

00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,390
and my Fortune 1000 data set.

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,190
This only reports on CEO changes which means when I start my portfolio

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,110
I have nothing, because it doesn't know about all the CEOs

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,990
coming into my strategy that are women.

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,850
So for the first two years here I have less than ten companies

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,360
in my portfolio.

00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,920
So when you look here the big up is actually a pharmaceutical company,

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,120
a bioscience company.

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,600
They got acquired by Bristol-Myers.

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,631
A couple weeks before it happened, the news got out,

00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:26,590
and its stock price quadrupled.

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,510
The big down there, that's October 2008.

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:35,710
So my strategy is not neutral to market fluctuations,

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:41,370
and this is a small sample size early on but it does grow over time.

00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,720
So then the next thing that happened is time passed.

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,220
I work on this in fits and bursts.

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,210
I'll dive into it for a month at a time and play with my strategy

00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,030
and learn more about our users, and then I come away

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,470
and I go to my real day job, and then I come back to this

00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,640
and play with it some more.

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,510
Over the course of -- the other interesting thing

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,300
that happened was I had the report

00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,620
from Catalyst that ended at the end of 2014,

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,570
and I had to wait 'til the end of 2015

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,810
to get new data from them on the Fortune 1000 CEOs for 2015,

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,740
and I talked with a lot of people about trying to get the data

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,500
on my own, looking at different things, but I just never did it.

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,580
So all of a sudden, I realized that I had out-of-sample data.

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,800
And if you do any kind of research, out-of-sample data is very important.

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,370
It's no different when you're looking at algorithms to invest in the market.

00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,700
This is not my strategy, this is a different strategy

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,660
shared with our community where the user did a two-year backtest,

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,670
and they were using machine learning actually to come up with a strategy.

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,440
Look at it, I mean, it performs wonderfully.

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,300
Wouldn't you like to be invested in this strategy?

00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,260
No volatility, up all the way, like this is wonderful,

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,610
and then they put it into some paper trading

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,840
which is trading against real market data with play money.

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,620
Then they put it into some real money,

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,120
and that's what happened because essentially the strategy

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,930
was overfit to the market within the backtests.

00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,150
So having out-of-sample data is a very important step

00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,510
in running any strategy that you wanted to invest in the market.

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,350
I can fully understand that for someone who does this professionally,

00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,860
waiting until you have out-of-sample is just painful.

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,040
For me, I was just doing something else and all of a sudden

00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,390
I was prepping to come here today and I was like, "Oh my god,

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,400
"I have out-of-sample data, this is amazing!"

00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,530
And I actually have 17 months of out-of-sample data.

00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,890
That's because I went back to Catalyst, I got the Fortune 1000 list.

00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:30,600
That's from the beginning of 2015 to -- I'm sorry, the beginning of 2002

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,580
to the end of 2015, and then I manually updated it to May 1, 2016.

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,820
I have 17 months of out-of-sample.

00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,280
This is the out-of-sample return charts, so you'll see my strategy,

00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,060
this is the Fortune 1000 version.

00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,730
Top line returns 332% over this period,

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,580
and there's a big difference on this chart I've got.

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,820
It goes red, it turns red here, and there's this blue thing.

00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,241
So this is actually an open-source library

00:33:57,241 --> 00:34:01,510
that our research team has created to evaluate time series of data.

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,370
It's basically looking at in-sample and out-of-sample data.

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,000
That blue cone -- I like to call it the cone of expectations.

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,659
Our very smart data scientists look at the historical stuff

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,870
and they've written some evaluation tools

00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,419
which basically say, "Did it perform as expected

00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:16,690
"or not as expected?"

00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,669
to try and understand if things are overfit.

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,579
Going outside of the cone of expectations too high,

00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:26,179
making more money than expected, is as bad as going too low

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:28,500
because it means that whatever you were doing historically

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,179
isn't carrying forward.

00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,699
So that's my strategy and out-of-sample data.

00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,740
I still get this one:

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,300
"Your benchmark is still wrong."

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,280
And again, what I was able to do actually was take a look at

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,480
the pipeline API.

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,179
Remember I told you how Fortune doesn't want to give me

00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,439
their historical lists?

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,240
I've tried; they're not interested.

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,220
So I decided to go and try and make a version of the Fortune 1000.

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,289
The Fortune 1000 is a little bit easier than the S&P 500

00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:57,769
because it's not handpicked by a group of people.

00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:01,230
It's just the 1000 biggest companies by revenue.

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,690
So that same API that I showed before,

00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,510
in theory allows me to do that, and what this does here

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,650
is it basically --

00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,789
the first two parts here is I get a bunch of data.

00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,810
So I find out is it the primary shares?

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,130
Does it have a market cap or is market cap null?

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,140
Is it a depository receipt?

00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,619
And I create a mask.

00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,509
I just want to clean out all the junk that's not

00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:24,070
like a normal company in the market.

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,109
I then get the revenue for every company

00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,170
and I rank that from top to bottom,

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,410
and then I set a screen saying just give me the top 1000 companies

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,089
by rank and mask out all of those things

00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,799
that I wanted to mask out.

00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,369
Now I do a little bit more work here because what I actually care about

00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,109
is removing all the companies

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:43,620
that have female CEOs that I’m investing in

00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,579
and just looking at the rest of the Fortune 1000.

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,520
You'll notice when I do that I call this the Quanto 1000.

00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,760
No trademark infringement here.

00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,440
[laughter]

00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,180
It gets a lot closer over the same time period

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,240
from the beginning of 2002 to May 1, 2016

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,849
there's only a 17% difference.

00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:07,779
So that's interesting that the women are outperforming

00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,299
still but not as sizably.

00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:12,359
And that brings me to the point where everybody says,

00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,809
"Okay, well, regardless of that, you've got a strategy

00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,119
"that looks like it does pretty well.

00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,319
"Are you going to invest in it?

00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,779
"Are you gonna live trade it?"

00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:21,060
and I was just, like two sessions ago, sitting next to a guy who said,

00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,260
"What are you talking about?"

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,480
And he goes, "Oh are you live trading it?"

00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,599
And I, you know, because when you have something returning

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,369
2 or 300%, you want to have money fights? snowball fights?

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:34,860
I don't know, I don't know.

00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,080
In any case, the thing that I did --

00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:39,880
the reason that I hadn't been able to live trade it

00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,160
so long was that that Catalyst data set,

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,900
I get it every year.

00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,480
Which isn't frequently enough to have something that I can trade

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,769
on a regular basis.

00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,559
I need a live data feed.

00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,660
So I took that code that I just showed you,

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,890
that's the revenue ranking to get the Quanto 1000.

00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,890
I took the code that gets me my EventVestor data set,

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:02,660
which is getting the CEO changes, and put that to work

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,000
building a strategy that's just changing -- doing the female CEOs

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,200
of the Quanto 1000 as they move forward through history.

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,740
That gives me, again, decent returns over the time period

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,300
outperforming the benchmark,

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,329
and this is starting to get to a strategy that I can actually trade.

00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:22,100
I have actually started to put this to work, our version of this,

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,950
against the paper trading which is Monopoly money.

00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,609
So it's using real market data but not real money

00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,980
because I don't have a lot of that.

00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,900
In order to do that I did some optimizing like,

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,799
what's the best universe to use?

00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,200
So I've gone from the point of, do I believe that I have

00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,400
a decent strategy?

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,140
Can I disprove my strategy?

00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,320
To, okay what's the best way to trade this?

00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:49,420
One of the things I looked at was different levels of the Quanto 1000.

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,390
Is it the Quanto 500 or the Quanto 2000?

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,030
Is more better or is less better?

00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,460
And interestingly Morgan Stanley just released a report

00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,509
similar to this, saying that the top performers

00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:04,319
with female CEOs do better than even the lower performers

00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,359
with female CEOs which I think rationally makes sense.

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,049
But you'll see here that the female CEOs of the Quanto 500

00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:14,250
do quite a bit better than the female CEOs of the Quanto 1000

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,750
or the female CEOs of the Quanto 2000.

00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,569
The other thing that the strategy allows me to do with the EventVestor data

00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:23,700
is actually compare just the female CEO changes

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,480
to the male CEO changes which looks like this.

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,529
So I went with the Quanto 500 because that was the best-performing company,

00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:35,079
and looked at the female CEOs as compared to just the male CEOs.

00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,440
Now interestingly, sample size continues to be a problem.

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,310
The female CEO strategy here at its max has only about 20 positions

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,760
and 20 different companies,

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,230
and Ursula Burns, the CEO of Xerox, just announced she's retiring

00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,480
later this year, so my strategy will actually sell out of Xerox

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,680
in a couple of months.

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,850
And if you go and do a blended version of this

00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:00,180
and just trade all CEO announcements, it only outperforms the male CEO strategy

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,299
by about 3% because while the females outperform the males dramatically here,

00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,920
there just aren't that many of them,

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,780
so once you put it in the broader thing it's much different.

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,360
So where does this leave us?

00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,000
I've thrown a ton of different charts at you and I have talked a lot,

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,600
and from my perspective this has been a wonderful experience

00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,109
to learn about my users.

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,750
I've taken a strategy through the idea, through research,

00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,410
through testing, and into live trading.

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,940
I've done the whole gambit and I've learned a lot

00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,579
about my users along the way.

00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,359
I hope that it will help me make a better product

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,159
as I continue to move forward with this,

00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,400
you know, building what we're building which is really fun.

00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,020
But it actually goes a little bit further than that for me.

00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,170
Quantopian is at the intersection of two very interesting industries,

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,440
technology and finance.

00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,980
Both of which are woefully lacking in diversity.

00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,720
They struggle, and in some ways we're doing a really good job at this.

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,710
This is a recent 24-hour period of our community backtesting.

00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,769
60% of our users are not in the United States,

00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,909
so we have wonderful international diversity.

00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,430
We also have unbelievable diversity in terms of

00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,749
the people using our platform aren't finance people.

00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:12,069
So we've made allocations in mechanical engineers,

00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:14,079
and in accountants,

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,490
in software engineers in big Silicon Valley companies.

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,650
But not people that only work in finance,

00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,890
so we have diversity of ideas,

00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,570
diversity of people with different backgrounds.

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,510
But by my estimate, we only have 4% percent of our community is female.

00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,520
And so our goal, the thing that we're doing

00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,000
is changing what it means to be a quant,

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,509
and who gets to be a quant, who gets to come up with ideas

00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:40,819
and have people allocate money to them to invest in those ideas.

00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,829
And the goal that I have, and the reason I stand up in here,

00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:45,599
is because I hope that when we change the way this is done

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,699
for men we change the way it's done for women as well.

00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:50,779
Thank you very much.

00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,760
[applause]

00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,380
I did --

00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,160
I meant to point out, we used to --

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,340
there are two different open-source libraries here that we use.

00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:04,020
I was supposed to talk about that.

00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,960
Zipline which is the backtester, it runs our whole platform.

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,720
It's open-source, anybody can see it.

00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,620
There's a sprint on it later this week,

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,440
so if you want to come learn more about Zipline you can.

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,470
And then Pyfolio is the risk analysis tool.

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,320
(moderator) We have a few minutes left

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,740
for Q&A, so if you have a question for Karen please come to the microphone.

00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,520
We only have one microphone on the left.

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,560
(Karen Rubin) Or go get lunch.

00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,960
(audience member 1) Thank you very much for the talk, Karen.

00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:36,690
So you've picked a, perhaps somewhat arbitrary characteristic, right?

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,470
Gender -- you could have picked eye color or hair color

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,960
or something like that.

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,180
Why do you think women may or may not be a tradeble strategy?

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,680
(Karen Rubin) You know, one of the things

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,520
that I can tell you is people ask me, like,

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,359
"Does this mean women are better CEOs than men?"

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,579
I have no idea.

00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,459
I picked this because I had the data,

00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,420
because it's personally interesting to me.

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,380
I have looked at trying to do something similar for race,

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,120
and I cannot get the data, it's much harder.

00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,300
I mean they don't have that.

00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,819
I don't know why the returns are this way.

00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,519
I've heard a lot of theories that there are just fewer women

00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,439
that are accepted into these positions,

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,260
that are asked to be in these positions,

00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,040
so they just have to be the best.

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,200
And maybe if you looked at all people with, I don't know, red eyes who are CEOs,

00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,559
they would also be great because there aren't very many of them?

00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,590
I'm not sure why this works out the way it does, but historically

00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,249
I do believe in the validity of the strategy over time.

00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,430
I also think if we get to a point where we don't have the sample size problem,

00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,240
where there are 50% female CEOs,

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,760
the strategy probably gets less interesting.

00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,580
(audience member 1) Thank you.

00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,500
(audience member 2) So did you happen to notice a bias

00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:50,069
in the data where you're going and sitting there and the price drops

00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,880
when it's announced, and then you make the purchase,

00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,780
and then the company actually recovers?

00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,500
(Karen Rubin) That is the very, very interesting thing.

00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:59,579
One of our interns last night -- we were looking into exactly that

00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,499
and saw that there was a 20-day lag.

00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:03,440
So a female CEO is announced,

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,350
and you can arbitrage money out of the market

00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,369
by buying the company when it's announced

00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:09,759
and holding it for 20 days, which I consider, like,

00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,659
the 20-day cycle on rationality.

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,920
Like, "Oh my God, a woman is in charge.

00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,750
"Well, it will probably be okay."

00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,020
[laughter]

00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,340
But I didn't do any work into that, another engineer did that work.

00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,180
(audience member 2) Thank you.

00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,980
(Karen Rubin) The other interesting one

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,700
although he told me, he wants to do on this is, in terms of CEOs,

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,660
short anything with an interim CEO, like just short those companies.

00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,290
You do not want to be an interim CEO.

00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,100
The version that I put into paper trading

00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:37,429
actually removes interim CEOs from my strategy altogether.

00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,620
(audience member 3) One of the tricks people use

00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,999
to prove crackpot economic theories is basically cherry-pick

00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,240
the start dates of their graphs,

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,049
so have you tried changing start dates to see if it works

00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:52,900
with a wide variety of periods?

00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,480
(Karen Rubin) Do you mean changing when the start date is,

00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,210
like, plus or minus after their actual start date?

00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,050
(audience member 3) No, no, no.

00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,800
The time period over which you evaluate the entire thing?

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,260
People will say, "Yes we can prove that."

00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,040
(Karen Rubin) No, I did --

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,880
in a previous version of the talk, I looked at like one year,

00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,980
five years, ten years; it holds true over the time period.

00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,499
I also had a version that are only things in my appendix

00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,359
where I just looked at the last year and a half,

00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,839
just the out-of-sample, and my strategy --

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,970
I think the female CEOs version of it outperforms the RSP by 3%

00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,650
over the last 17 months,

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,540
so it continues to perform, outperform, but not as dramatically.

00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,890
Obviously the longer you hold there's more option for it to do well

00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,240
over that time period,

00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,019
and there are some companies that start and end

00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:34,970
the entire simulation with a female CEO

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,720
so I'm just buying and hold.

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,940
And it's a long buy and hold strategy on a lot of those companies.

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,140
So I've done a little bit of that, but yes.

00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,280
(audience member 4) This might be a bit of a similar question

00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:50,319
but like the Fortune 500, doesn't it change over time?

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,440
So at the moment of buying those companies were in Fortune 500

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,269
and if they moved out of it, then you wouldn't buy it anymore?

00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:59,180
(Karen Rubin) Yes, that's true, I do not --

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,299
the female CEO version does not take into account

00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,589
that they might have fallen out of the Fortune 1000.

00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,009
It's just the fact that they were in it ever.

00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:10,181
And so that changes the comparison against the Fortune 1000 benchmark

00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:11,880
of the Quanto 1000.

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,829
The Quanto 1000 -- because the Fortune 1000

00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:18,049
changes every year -- I rebalance that one annually in June

00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,100
when the new list is announced.

00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,460
But, yeah, the female stuff -- they could fall out of the Fortune 1000

00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,349
but remain in my portfolio.

00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:27,519
So that, you know -- benchmarks are hard.

00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,359
That's one of the reasons why I like the RSP

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,910
as the best benchmark to use because it's just an equal-weighted S&P 500

00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,859
which is considered to be the market benchmark,

00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:39,660
but yeah, that is not something that it does.

00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,490
They don't come out of my strategy when they're out of the Fortune 1000.

00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,670
I don't think I have that data even.

00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,420
(moderator) I guess we only have time

00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,460
for one more question, sorry.

00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,880
(Karen Rubin) I’ll stay around too.

00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,760
(audience member 5) Hi, this is actually a question for my friend.

00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:56,849
I have never used your product but he does.

00:45:56,849 --> 00:46:00,349
He was wondering if there's going to be a plan to release, I guess like,

00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:02,900
a feature of options trading?

00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,859
(Karen Rubin) So we're working on adding more markets.

00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,970
Futures is next.

00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,099
International markets will be down the line.

00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,690
Options will be down the line,

00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,730
but market expansion is definitely where we're headed.

00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,560
(audience member 5) Okay, thank you.

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,360
(Karen Rubin) Absolutely, thanks everyone.

00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,120
(moderator) Thank you, Karen.

00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,920
I guess if you have a question that was not answered?

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,760
(Karen Rubin) Oh yeah, I'll be here.

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,540
(moderator) Feel free to talk to Karen

00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,480
if you have any questions, thank you.

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,080
