did Fido as the most wanted feature in

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,840
Firefox and today five years later these

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,300
standards are supported by all leading

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,030
platforms and browsers and computers and

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,490
mobile devices and many of you are also

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,710

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,530
successfully protect your data projects

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,799
today I'm going to show you how it works

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,630
with the Yubikey and an iPhone after you

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,310
have installed the app to log into your

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,780
account

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:28,740
just tap the Yubikey on the back of your

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,689
phone and you are not in you can also

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,700
plug in the Yubikey 5ci

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:39,150
with a lightning connection and you tap

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,970
this to verify that you are a real human

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,630
behind the computer and the phone and

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,509
not to try and the Yubikey 5c I also has

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,299
a USB C port that works on all modern

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,340
computers and once you register your

Yubikey with your github account you

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,840

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,570
