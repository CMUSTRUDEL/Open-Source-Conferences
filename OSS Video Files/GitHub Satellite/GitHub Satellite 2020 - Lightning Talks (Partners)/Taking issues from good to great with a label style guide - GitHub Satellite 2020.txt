hey everybody George from Zen hub here

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,080
with a pro tip around taking issues from

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,900
good to great by establishing a label

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,570
style guide and using it so first off go

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,009
Google issue label style guide they're a

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,839
bunch of them out there this is a great

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,779
one we reference all the time and you

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,640
can see right away that by collecting

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,380
work together around colors it really

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,439
makes communication become a visual

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,500
thing you look at that github issue view

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,739
and you use colors consistently and

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,579
things just pop the issue list

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,700
communicates to you labels are a

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,530
free-form field you can add emojis

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,469
reserved special colors for special

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,190
purposes use that deep red to show the

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,840
blocked issues so that when a team

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,300
member applies it the rest of the team

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,969
sees it and can come to their assistance

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,359
and the best thing is that because

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,219
labels flow across the entire github

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,439
ecosystem when you add a third-party

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,740
tool and you're using labels

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,869
consistently they just work so you want

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,090
to filter your Zen hub board to show

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,150
just the work around the new ebook

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,729
you're working on use the label you want

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,250
to see how much work has gone on sprint

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,869
to sprint around that ebook project use

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,450
the label it all just pops so labels are

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,579
a seemingly simple but unbelievably

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,829
powerful addition to get up issues and

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,840
allow you to really focus in on the

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,720
things that matter so that you can get

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,310
things done enjoy the rest of github

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,310
