GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

I have a tip for developers to keep this

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,750
off the secure our shift left we have

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,179
created a product called scan to scan

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,790
your source code and dependencies for

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,230
vulnerabilities and the best part it

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,540
integrates with your key table action

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,779
workflow and the newly announced code

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,939
scanning feature let me show it to you

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:24,660
in this sample repo I've already added

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,670
sugar of skin so as he navigates I can

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,579
see all my shift left scan results here

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,829
and this is the list from each scanners

00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:38,280
you can view the list like how you use

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,579
github and enact on the vulnerabilities

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,230
by choosing this drop down and in this

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:49,610
particular case I feel this is a false

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,840
positive scan supports multiple analysis

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,699
for example in addition to scanning

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,579
source code we can also check the source

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:00,390
code for any secret links let me see

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:05,820
what secrets or it says oops

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:10,229
there is one AWS keep informed I have to

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,299
remember to reset that key these are

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,220
actual results from the runs and you can

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,150
see the whole bill took only a couple of

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,000
minutes finally we can have fast and

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,369
security with ports can hang it up

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,340
natively working together to learn more

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,880
