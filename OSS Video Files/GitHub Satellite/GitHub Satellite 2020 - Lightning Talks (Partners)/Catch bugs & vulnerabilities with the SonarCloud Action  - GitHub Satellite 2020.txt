GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

hi everyone Niklas from the sauna sauce

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,359
team we're in the Sun our source Oregon

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,630
github and we make Sun our clouds an

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,820
online service to cut bugs and

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,469
vulnerabilities in your code and we

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,440
built an action last year called the

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,029
Cerner cloud scan action which is

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,100
basically the action that lets you

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,710
automate the scan of your code so that

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,650
anytime you push a commit or you open up

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,779
a pull request we scan the code for bugs

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,539
and vulnerabilities and star cloud is

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,640
even gonna get back in your pull request

00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,850
to let you know about anything it coats

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,680
in the code you pushed so the biggest

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,040
challenge for us when we build this was

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,200
to keep it that simple and super fast I

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,719
know I as a developer when I get

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,610
feedback about my code the earlier I can

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,860
get it then the more time I can spend

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,710
and to really understand what's going on

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,110
and make an appropriate fix so in terms

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,910
of opportunities I think that's the the

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,940
biggest chance you get with this action

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,440
they're not only going to find issues in

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,860
the code but you're going to get a

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,060
chance to learn best practices

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,610
understand what's going on in your code

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,490
and and what it takes to write quality

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,220
code and secure coding best practices so

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,080
super simple to get started go to Sauron

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,299
cloud dot IO you can log in with your

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,939
github accounts it's totally free for

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,159
public projects and you'll get to import

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,590
your repos on board your projects and

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,689
find bugs and vulnerabilities and no

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,409
time with the Hana cloud scan action

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,409
