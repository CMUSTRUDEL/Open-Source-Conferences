my name is Aaron LeBeau I am the

00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,919
engineering lead for the ey developer

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,620
experience i ey and one of the things

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,880
that we're working on right now is a

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,160
solution that helps development teams

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,289
internal source project so when I say

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,510
internal source it's a word that

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,949
sometimes people are confused by but if

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,930
we look at the open source movement and

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,060
what it has done for the entire world

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,710
it's made it a better place if we look

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,210
at products like Linux which is probably

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,609
the most popular operating system on the

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,080
planet it's open source if you look at

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,780
either Microsoft's development tools

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,790
like dotnet xamarin these are things

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,100
that are open source technology now the

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,809
code is freely available on github and

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,300
you can go look at that source code you

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,300
can use it and your products and build

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,489
better things because of that now a lot

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,230
of times in big enterprise companies say

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,420
for example UI where we're you know

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,829
three hundred thousand plus people one

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,360
of the problems with internal sourcing

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,610
is how do you do that in a way that is

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,219
productive and how do you do in a way

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,920
that you could protect your code and how

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,270
do you guarantee enterprise level

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,010
security around your source code in your

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,260
IP because a lot of times your

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,479
applications and your source code is

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,650
your IP this is this is your brand this

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,299
is where you're making your money and

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,450
this is your analytical and intellectual

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,549
property so when we talk about that and

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,130
we look at a solution we're building a

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,200
solution around github enterprise and we

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,030
call it the UI developer experience and

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,130
one of these theories I would like to do

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,860
like the lightening lecture on and talk

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,299
to other people about is why you should

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,100
do this why you should be looking at

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,259
internal sourcing your stuff especially

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,180
at larger companies and how you can use

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,189
github and it's taking framework and

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,689
enterprise development to find it

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,420
promote these kind of different pieces

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,030
of software so I have right now open and

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,380
in an example here is our product that

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,540
we're working on called the UI developer

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,950
experience and this is our UI T

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,020
environment so this is nothing this is

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,700
all fake stuff this is a real production

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,070
code but if we were to go look at it

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,140
I've got an example here of a singleton

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,259
pattern see show and one of these cool

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,450
things about having this kind of level

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,460
of integration is being able to share

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,979
these concepts of best practices of

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,479
patterns for example and here's a really

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,000
well-written document that gives a

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,890
summary of you know this is the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,390
singleton pattern come

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,120
for a mathematical concept of the

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,470
singleton and we go through the

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,080
description to kind of explain to people

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,430
well you may have went to school and in

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,140
computer science class and every single

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,980
- it is but in c-sharp specifically

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,569
there's some things you have to take

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,160
into consideration that maybe you

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,780
haven't thought about and so in our

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,180
description or instructions it kind of

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,310
tells us about that we have a link to a

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,990
Microsoft stream code talk where we go

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,459
through and review that but one of the

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,980
greatest things is the get code button

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,840
that links to a literal repository in

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,260
github enterprise and this reprise start

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,580
right here and this is where the github

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,650
enterprise integration starts to really

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,989
kick it and saying well I have a repo

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,400
here of the actual source code so if

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,620
somebody wants to go look at it they can

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,390
see that source code this is a pattern

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,519
now that if I wanted to bring this into

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,590
my application I learned can go to this

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,660
repo grab the source code bring it into

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,720
my application and start to play around

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,130
with it in a POC fashion and we start

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,630
talking about this this is where you

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,330
change the way that you start thinking

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,450
it as a company as you start to reuse

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,180
code and reuse patterns and even going

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,530
up to Reason frameworks now the issue

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,290
with the when you want to get into

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,549
frameworks is then well how say for

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,560
example that you build a mobile

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,390
framework that allows your all mobile

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,190
applications to be very used very

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,720
quickly because maybe it has a built-in

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,280
internal authentication library and a

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,840
couple other things but then the problem

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,579
is it says so people go get your

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,579
framework and say for example maybe you

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:38,959
put it as your DevOps in the artifactory

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,090
but you can go get those artifacts and

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,769
their new get packages or or you know

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,450
whatever product you're using to get

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,870
those artifacts out to these development

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,100
teams

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,140
well now the problems they run into a

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,940
problem you know they have a bug within

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,350
it how do they do that well with github

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,380
enterprise it really solves that problem

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,670
if you look at Azure DevOps and you were

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,989
trying to do this in agile devops well

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,700
now you have to have a project now you

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,470
have to give everyone access to it when

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,480
you get access to the repos the security

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,100
management gets to be kind of a mess and

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,299
especially when you want to protect the

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,220
board's where you don't want everybody

00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,079
every development team to see your add

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,579
your dev boards but you want to access

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,079
the source code so then now you have to

00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,299
go through all this security management

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,980
well in the world of github this is

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,930
really easy and you can just basically

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,100
put your framework out here and if they

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,840
have a problem with it you just

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,640
basically tell them to post an issue and

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,660
maybe it's not even an issue maybe it's

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,310
a new feature request

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,470
well now you can manage all that stuff

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,330
in a way that the opens

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,910
community does this is some of the vel

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,500
pers already known understand most

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,110
developers not our developing software

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,580
have used github they have to because

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,830
most things are open-source these days

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,890
everything like I said from xamarin to

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,300
dotnet react native one of the most

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,000
popular JavaScript frameworks and world

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,070
all these are open source angular so if

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,320
you're building the two most popular web

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,540
frameworks something about webpages with

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,370
are both open-source you start talking

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,900
about that you see that most of the

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,600
things you're gonna build are in this

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,830
interface that you're used to so because

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,210
of that you're not retraining your

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,520
development teams but on top of that

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,110
you're basically given them a community

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,300
place that they can start to interact

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,560
with each other and then all you have to

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,880
do it really is take a look at building

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,620
a portal solution around out your

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,240
company and which is optional right

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,610
we're looking at that because we want to

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,470
have a community in gamification and we

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,210
want to have best practices that's what

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,620
our methodology section allows us to do

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,780
the kind of best practices around

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,310
development how to check it out Co

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,200
branch and strategy all those kind of

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,640
things well I look at the heart of

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,140
really what we're trying to do we're

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,970
trying to get to the point of code reuse

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,530
and a lot of that that comes out to

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,000
github Enterprise and how great it is at

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,010
promoting where to find code you know

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,450
you could once again it's taking system

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,220
if you take everything properly and

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,740
github Enterprise makes it really easy

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,890
to promote how to go find something and

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,500
you may go sue say okay where's the the

00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,380
top three react components dealing with

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,000
X feature would say dashboarding well

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,919
you can just go into github Enterprise

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,960
you go to your corporation level you can

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,840
go look and say okay I'm looking for the

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,520
back native tag and I'm also looking for

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,380
dashboarding and then look back and see

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,790
what comes based off that and now you

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,080
can go see all those package to take a

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,729
look at those you can see how many

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,740
people are using them how many pull

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,330
requests put against it but if you wrap

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,710
up a portal site like we have we also

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,560
have this ability to give feedback on

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,729
that and so I think it's a perfect

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,290
marriage of two different piece of

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,330
technologies and that's what we're you

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,740
working on here ey I'd love to do a

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,330
presentation and maybe talk to some

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,310
other people about how they can use

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,140
github Enterprise for that and the final

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,000
feature that we have that we love in the

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,530
security world of github enterprise is

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,050
really this this theory around

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,310
enterprise authentication so everything

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,270
that we can right now today I've got a

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,830
mobile phone here

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,020
my

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,430
enterprise's single sign-on but I have

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,800
the Microsoft Authenticator app on my

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,190
phone and so not only we we have

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,990
dedicating in and then we also have our

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,030
our Federation authentication we also

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,860
require every developer to use the

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,050
Microsoft authentication medicator app

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,699
and so we're getting that really really

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,970
deep level of security also built into

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,650
this so it gives the business sponsors

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,990
that you know are saying you know is our

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,389
IP protected a better level a better

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,050
comfortably can say no we guarantee that

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:10,800
we're using enterprise level security to

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,630
guarantee that only the people that

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,909
should be able to also get into the

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,770
portal can get into it so I appreciate

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:19,050

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,840
what we're kind of working on and what

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,250
we'd like a bug github enterprise and

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,500
