so you try to work on your game right

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,819
now but your machine keeps getting

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,890
locked up with builds have you tried

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,820
making a build pipeline with github and

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,670
Azure I'm Kieran and I am the project

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,170
lead add a few dragons today I want to

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,460
talk to you about build pipelines and

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,529
how they can help making your game

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,970
easier for you

00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,170
there are many reasons why build

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,850
pipelines are so great for game

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,849
development but I think I'm just gonna

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,949
go over a few today one of the main ones

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,269
is it's easier to get things out to

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,219
testers have you ever tried to get

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,899
something out to a tester you built it

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,910
you've uploaded it you shared it with

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,200
them it didn't work or they found

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,450
something immediately wrong and you have

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,270
to build all that again we can make that

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,399
faster with build pipelines build

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,010
pipelines are so great because you can

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,440
get things out to multiple testers or on

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,879
multiple platforms straight away so you

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,890
can commit that big piece of work that

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,410
you've just finished as soon as you've

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,180
committed that to github it starts going

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,890
out and starts building Mac it starts

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,180
building Linux starts building Windows

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,710
that's all finished

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,070
it lets you know you can set up a

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,650
deployment task that link messages or

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,970
your testers so you can focus on the

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,170
thing that you want to be doing instead

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,400
of build and that is making the game so

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,490
there are three steps I'll talk about

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,020
when I make a build and deploy pipeline

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,750
the first part of any pipeline is the

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,460
source control you are using github is

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,170
great because when you make a project

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,990
you can set it up with ignore files for

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,579
many of the popular game engines today

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,259
if you aren't already using github or

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,729
some other type of source control for

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,979
your project you should really consider

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,960
it because it can save you so much

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,090
stress keep a cloud copy of your work

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,430
makes it easier for working in teams

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,270
I can't highly recommend it enough it

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,619
saved me so many times the next part of

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,320
your pipeline is going to be the

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,840
building part this is a server that

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,299
takes your game files and builds it into

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,909
an executable for your clients or your

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,820
users to run all your testers it can be

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,829
anything this is something that you will

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,780
have to set up yourself depending on

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,790
your game engine things like as you

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,550
already have some stuff for things like

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,370
unity but if you're using unreal or

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,020
ghetto or something else you'll have to

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,030
make something custom but

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,700
this is a good part where you can set up

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,980
two unit tests and other things that

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,840
allow you to test your build before it

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,720
goes out on to your stores and the

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,030
deploy phase and it can notify you when

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,790
something breaks before it goes out to

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:35,220
your users lastly is the deploy phase

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,760
this is where the artifact from your

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,300
build phase is used and deployed to many

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,950
of your servers or a storefront or your

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,140
testers it can be any number of things

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,540
and it doesn't have to be just one you

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,550
can do lots of things if you have lots

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,560
of different platforms you can do it all

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,330
simultaneously what's great about this

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,700
is you can be notified when the deploy

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,110
is finished you can do approvals work so

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,630
if you want some testing to be done

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,090
before the deploy goes out to steam or

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,540
discord or GOG you can make that happen

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,160
I know it doesn't feel like much but

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,350
these three simple steps of a build

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,630
pipeline can make working with your game

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,630
so much less of a headache for you I

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,870
can't recommend doing enough it has made

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,600
things like nightly builds for my

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,459
testers a thousand times easier if you

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,620
want to get in contact with me here's my

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,570
details you can just get in contact with

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,010
me on Twitter at twitter.com forward

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,050
slash hookshot if you want to know any

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,850
more about build pipelines I'm sure I'll

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,030
be happy to answer any questions thank

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,030
