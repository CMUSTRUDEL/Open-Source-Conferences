hi my name is bond and I'm a teacher at

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:12,259
Tech I thought you can find me with the

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,780
condo at beer and easy on the mud

00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:22,590
recently I wanted to teach a few people

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:25,619
how to use git and github to like manage

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,470
the tasks on track that good right and

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,489
pedo blending lab provides resources to

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:36,600
be able to do that right but I wanted to

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:40,079
make them put their learning to practice

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,370
and I came up with a challenge that they

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,200
could do but for the challenges I wanted

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,600
to be able to merge their code back to

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,020
the upstream repo when they are done but

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,750
that would make them eat it so only one

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,829
person I have to create branches on

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:05,339
reaching a person or dealer actions lets

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:09,540
you run a workflow against any event on

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,810
the pub and so what I did was read it it

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,650
workflow for the photo boat all right so

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,400
when the repo is fort this workflow runs

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,630
and in workflow basically creates a new

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,920
branch for create a new branch in the

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,549
repo for with the name of whoever was

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,030
where my folks do so you have this

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:38,939
personality actor and this monster this

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,100
is the scripts downs the code spree the

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,560
branch and this is possible using the

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,110
action get up scripts which is provided

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,970
by give up and so now my students can

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,299
fork to be pariahs

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,979
what's it sports right and there now for

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:03,180
six branches you'll be that the branches

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:06,000
branches the names or the usernames of

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,940
the student support and now students can

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,730
submit a PR as we already we also have

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,250
another

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,920
all flow d'harans when they pull it was

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,250
the submitter to run the tests for the

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,970
challenge to see them solve the poet and

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:33,330
now incidents of meats yeah

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:38,270
Simon's they can simply targets their

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:42,739
own branch a branch for their own name

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:49,220
and that right so that's that branch

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:49,220
