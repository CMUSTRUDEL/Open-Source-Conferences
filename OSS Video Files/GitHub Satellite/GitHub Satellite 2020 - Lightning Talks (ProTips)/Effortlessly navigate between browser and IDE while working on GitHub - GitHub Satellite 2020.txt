GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

what's up github I'm Nikki I hope

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,279
everyone's okay during these difficult

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,470
times I'm sure it can be hard on some

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,790
families but please hang tight and we're

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,440
going to get through this together

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,670
also I'm glad that we have this

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,580
opportunity with these virtual

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,670
conferences to try to stay connected at

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,430
these difficult times of isolation okay

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,960
so why am I here well it's a good hub

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,480
conference and of course this is my

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,180
github handle I want to share with you a

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,890
Productivity tip which especially for

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,759
people who love shortcuts and

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,120
optimizations I'm sure will be greatly

00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,690
beneficial for them and would gain

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,989
significant productivity out of it so

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:46,289
let me zoom to my screen right now and

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:48,809
directly explain what I mean so this is

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,460
my ID and as you know IDs provide us

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,680
with lots of cool functionalities but

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm going to focus on particularly want

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,199
one thing and it's file retrieval how do

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,420
we do that well lots of IDs provide us

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,760
with these quick find menus which allow

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,559
us to maybe write a file name and it

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,450
would directly jump to this file and you

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,479
can review it play around with and

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,729
whatever you can even provide a whole

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,369
file path and this would jump to the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,500
specific path again and you can play

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,939
around again and this happens to be very

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,490
convenient by the way when you're doing

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,950
code review and I do it all the time

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,380
when working on github because if you

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,210
have seen maybe for a half a year now

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,040
github has provided us with an option

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,380
when you're reviewing a specific file

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,350
you can click on this button here which

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,840
is a clipboard clipboard icon which

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,659
essentially copies the file path to your

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,869
clipboard and this way you can jump to

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,759
your ID and paste the file path and you

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,560
can jump to this file and this is really

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,720
cool if you don't if you haven't done

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
this I suggest you make the habit of

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,689
doing this and this is my tip for

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,060
everyone who doesn't do this it will

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,880
increase your productivity for sure but

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,439
I'm here for something more so from my

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,189
experience I found that this isn't the

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,930
best use of my time and maybe it well

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,110
more precisely it's not the most

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,300
efficient way of working from the

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,039
browser to the ID and so I needed made

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,930
something more efficient so let me try

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,819
to explain let's say that we're

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,040
reviewing this

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,650
here and we're really focused on this

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,450
section here and we want to go to our ID

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,519
to maybe get some more context and play

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,560
around with the code so what would I

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,499
have to do to go to exactly this point

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,780
in my ID well like I said I would have

00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:32,180
to break my focus and go to the top and

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,639
copy the file path right so I click it

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,519
then I would have to engage my

00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,889
short-term memory and further lose my

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,349
focus by trying to remember this line

00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:45,530
number here so I can go to exactly it I

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:47,419
would go to my ID I would paste the file

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,909
path and then I would have to manually

00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,769
write out the line number that I just

00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:54,829
saw there if I even remember it

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:57,139
correctly and boom we're there so this

00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:59,510
was relatively fast but if you cuts me

00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,949
hinting there are some negative

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,049
consequences so not not only is this

00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:08,299
harder and maybe takes more time than it

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:11,180
should but it also breaks your focus

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,699
having to remember having to go to the

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,659
top of the file and also engages your

00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,209
short-term memory

00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:20,239
unnecessarily so what I decided to do

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,479
was fix this what I did was uploading

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,659
codes line clipper it's for your browser

00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,430
and what essentially it does is it

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,069
allows you to when you're focused on

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,169
particular point in your github preview

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,870
you can simply click on the line number

00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:38,000
and it will this would copy the file

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,519
path to your clipboard along with the

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,099
line numbers to fix to it and then you

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,049
can simply go to your ID paste this and

00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,870
go to this file voila

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,120
and this is the essence of what I wanted

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,889
to show you frankly and the solution is

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,780
more generic than that because it works

00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:56,569
on every github file which has line

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,180
numbers so if I open this file here we

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,400
can see line numbers and I can copy that

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,759
to my clipboard and it works fine it's

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,229
especially helpful if also if you're

00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,729
opening a brand new pull request and you

00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:11,209
just want to skim over what this

00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:12,979
discussion is going is it what is what

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,750
this discussion is about what's being

00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,269
commented so for example this snippet

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,909
here maybe I'm interested enough and I

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,639
want to go to the ID and check it out so

00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:26,710
I can simply again click on this line

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:30,550
number and then open my ID paste it and

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,740
I am there okay so this was basically it

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,270
the you can find the plug in the source

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,160
code it's an open source project and

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,990
I'll be glad for your contributions

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,419
maybe github will eventually make this

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,910
natively to github platform but this was

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,840
basically it you can find a link to the

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:50,490
plug-in itself in my repo and yeah thank

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,490
