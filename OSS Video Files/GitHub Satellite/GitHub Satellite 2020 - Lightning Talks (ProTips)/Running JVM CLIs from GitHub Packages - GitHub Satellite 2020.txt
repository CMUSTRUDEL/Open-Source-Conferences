JavaScript folks lesson on the breeze

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,770
they simply tell MPM to create the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,289
appropriate github package registry and

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,000
then execute the package we have P acts

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,810
for example if they want to friend a cow

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,510

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,000
to get her packages and finally you

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,629
execute it with a tool called env NX

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,180
entrusted than watch avian X is an NPM

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,789
package that can download and run charts

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,489
from an amazing repository including the

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,820
github package registry you tell em via

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,280
max the github owner and repo with the

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,030
usual maven coordinates the group ID the

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,820
artefact ID and optional version then

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,560
Alvie onyx runs the charr without

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,020
installing a single thing the major

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,470
repositories provided by the github

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,659
packages open up great opportunities so

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,299
