hi my name is Arman Agarwal my github

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,059
user name is also Arman Agarwal

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,950
my pro tip is to use k-dubb resolve

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,170
commits online this feature is really

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,750
new and not many people know about it

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,330
but it's one of the best features that

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,520
I've discovered so far on new features

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,640
could have I discovered so far it helps

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,250
you resolve conflicts changes really

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,900
really quickly and really helpful and

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,599
you can straightaway resolve the

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,540
conflicts and more simple requests or

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,260
anything any sort of code or is it real

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,920
easily

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,920
