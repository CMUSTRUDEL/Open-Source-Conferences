hi everyone this is user visa coming at

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,220
you from my treadmill desk

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,410
win the octocat during the Crone

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,300
apocalypse and today I want to tell you

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,540
about a get up action that is super

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,520
useful super unsexy so many of us host

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,470
documentation whether it's on get pages

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,090
or read the docs are just in read Me's

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,859
that have broken links

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,320
you know websites go away they change

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,900
whatever but this is really really bad

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,960
for our user base so to help with that

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,969
you can use the URLs techie URL check in

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,579
checker action which also has a

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,920
corresponding Python library and it

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,379
makes it really easy to specify things

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,719
like timeouts and retries and white

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,079
lists and custom parts single file types

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,120
and subfolders and just automate that

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,070
you can schedule it run it on pork wrap

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,780
so you make sure that the links that you

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,250
have in your documentation or your code

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,570
aren't broken so please try it out and I

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,250
hope everyone is staying safe and

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,009
healthy during these times

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,009
