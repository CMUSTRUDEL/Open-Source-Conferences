good morning good afternoon or good

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,700
evening everyone I'm going to talk about

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:12,809
how Microsoft teams can work well with

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,179
get up actions for chattels challenge my

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,000
name is Justin from Microsoft working as

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,750
a senior cloud advocate here are my key

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,090
tap handle twitter handle and my blog so

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,369
we are going to talk about get

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,039
affections it's really good for the

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:34,170
continuous deployment which doesn't need

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,809
getting but let's think about this what

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,140
if we need to implement continuous

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:45,059
delivery which requires approval or some

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,820
sort of post approval gained feature is

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,289
one of the poses used in the continuous

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,940
delivery approach unfortunately Khattab

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,070
actions workflow doesn't have this

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,960
feature like opera gate yet therefore we

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,140
need to implement this feature by

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,140
ourselves

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,930
where do you think these approvals

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,270
happen largely it is hosted within the

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,280
organization's collaboration tools or

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,590
messaging tools from this perspective

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,820
Microsoft teams is perfect candidate to

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,799
implement this offer Brigade feature in

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,060
other words we are going to use

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,100
Microsoft teams for Chatham's

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,220
through the kit of actions workflow we

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,740
can send messages to teams and within

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,890
the team's channel managers can push the

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,180
button for Google so let's have a look

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,930
at this engine after publishing the

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,670
artifact to the eyes of lobster each

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,549
this workflow has sent a message to

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,100
Microsoft teams using this section at

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,790
the same time the message has come up to

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,009
a channel which is really great

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:05,329
however the real value of these chat ops

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,550
is this button when I click this button

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:12,520
it sends a signal back to get of actions

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:15,730
to invoke the rest of deployment process

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,430
and finally the artifact has been

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,230
published to the production the

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,910
deployment of Regent has been captured

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,160
as a reply of this conversation well

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,700
this is the real power of chat ops and

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,540
my github actions make this possible as

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:40,230
I shall go this Microsoft action enables

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,230
developers implement the approval gate

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:47,230
there are around 10 actions related to a

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:51,820
Microsoft teams nowadays but when I

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:54,460
published mine it was the only one yes

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:58,090
mine was the first ever get up actions

00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,820
for Microsoft teams the most successful

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,280
factor of this action is their it send

00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,810
messages to teams with virtually any

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,720
woman in other words the message format

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:14,140
is fully customizable as long as it

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,360
follows the messages schema but at the

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,180
same time it has become a drawback

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,360
because it gives too much freedom

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,160
setting up the message format so the

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,950
first challenge of this section is

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,810
templating this action should allow

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,420
predefined templates so that only

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,740
relevant parameters can fill up the

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:39,209
message and this is a no challenge

00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:44,260
I chose decision to write this section

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:47,410
therefore I had to use two action but it

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,280
means that this action only runs on the

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:56,020
Linux runner that on Windows or Mac due

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,780
to the current limitation therefore this

00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,140
is the second challenge that it should

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,830
be running on all runner platforms the

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:09,310
current version of this section is 0.8 I

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:12,880
hope when it becomes version 1 even sort

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,910
out these two limitations I would say

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,959
that the current version of jericho d8

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,160
is fully working perfectly but has those

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,560
two challenges

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,170
the document for this section is pretty

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,710
straightforward and well-written

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:33,500
but if you still want to know where to

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,150
start I would recommend you visiting

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,470
those two links as your starting point

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,420
the first one is a simple workflow and

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,930
the second link is the team's message

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,670
structure reference I have also written

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,770
the several blog post about it of

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,940
actions which will help you understand

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,550
it yep this is for now if you have any

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,080
questions around this team section

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:01,660
please reach out to me through social

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,660
