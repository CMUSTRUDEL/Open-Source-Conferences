GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

hi I'm Rui and I created action cats

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,170
after seeing that github was running a

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,389
hackathon for creating new actions

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,099
I used actions a lot at work for

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,049
automating our tests and checking code

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,870
quality and they thought it would be fun

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,910
to try creating my own one so when I

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,160
looked at the hackathon categories I was

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,539
interested in the chat category the idea

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,269
that I could add to the conversation the

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,400
PR or commits seemed really cool since

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,779
this is quite low on time I decided to

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,880
make a novelty action which pushes the

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,149
cat upon your PRS to reward you for

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,620
pushing code writing the app code for

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,130
the action was much easier than I had

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,320
expected

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,780
I wanted to write it in typescript and

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,780
found that get up provided a handy

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,399
template for the skeleton of the action

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,170
from there is just a case of reading the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,410
documentation and finding enough cat

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,030
gifts we started using the action at

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,410
work and I was really surprised to see

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,230
that people across the world were also

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,570
using it the action was way more popular

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,399
than I thought and it was very cool to

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,910
have something spread organically

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,439
through github I really enjoy writing

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,820
actions as it's a way to interact

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,869
directly with the developer community

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,130
and quickly release something useful and

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,340
while you're releasing a few more in the

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,049
near future actually so a novelty

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,060
actually I was toying with was allowed

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,400
for a pizza to be delivered to teams

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,020
when all the tests pass and the coach

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,509
deployed around lunchtime or maybe a

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,220
Friday afternoon that's the great thing

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,290
about being able to write code you can

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,380
make a toy app but actually people end

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,540
up using it and iterating on it overall

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,450
I'm really enjoying using actions and

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,920
hope that the ecosystem grows so thanks

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,869
again get help from vice news talk at

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,549
satellite and if you want to keep up

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,299
with what I'm doing you can find me on

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,659
Twitter or github at really WM thanks

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,659
